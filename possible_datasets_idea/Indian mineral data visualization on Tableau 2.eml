Indian mineral data visualization on Tableau
// R-bloggers

(This article was first published on My Data Science Journey, and kindly con=
tributed to R-bloggers)
Being a self learner and explorative by nature, I love to try out new techno=
logy and keep learning something all the time. Especially, working in a Biot=
ech organization as a data scientist, and being the only one in the region, =E2=
=80=9Ctechnical=E2=80=9D talks and discussions are very limited from the pro=
gramming world perspective. So I spend my evenings experimenting with techno=
logy and reading tech blogs, websites and papers.

One visualization tool I am in love with is Tableau. I find it very cool to b=
e able to quickly build a dashboard of graphs, with all the interactivity, i=
n few minutes. Of course data needs to be =E2=80=9Cprepared=E2=80=9D first l=
ike any other data science.

I installed the Tableau app from Tableau public website. Now the data, there=
 is a plethora of data for budding data scientists to play with. I got this d=
ata set from https://data.gov.in/ which provides data to the public as a par=
t of the open data initiative from the Govt.

I wanted to see how much the various minerals were produced and what were th=
eir values were. Also see the states on the map of India and in parallel vis=
ualize the numbers. Another interesting bit is to know what type of mineral e=
ach is =E2=80=93 fuel, metallic or non metallic. After a few iterations, thi=
s is how my dashboard finally looks.

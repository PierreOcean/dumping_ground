Abstract = {{Hybridization has many and varied impacts on the process of speciation.
   Hybridization may slow or reverse differentiation by allowing gene flow
   and recombination. It may accelerate speciation via adaptive
   introgression or cause near-instantaneous speciation by
   allopolyploidization. It may have multiple effects at different stages
   and in different spatial contexts within a single speciation event. We
   offer a perspective on the context and evolutionary significance of
   hybridization during speciation, highlighting issues of current interest
   and debate. In secondary contact zones, it is uncertain if barriers to
   gene flow will be strengthened or broken down due to recombination and
   gene flow. Theory and empirical evidence suggest the latter is more
   likely, except within and around strongly selected genomic regions.
   Hybridization may contribute to speciation through the formation of new
   hybrid taxa, whereas introgression of a few loci may promote adaptive
   divergence and so facilitate speciation. Gene regulatory networks,
   epigenetic effects and the evolution of selfish genetic material in the
   genome suggest that the DobzhanskyMuller model of hybrid
   incompatibilities requires a broader interpretation. Finally, although
   the incidence of reinforcement remains uncertain, this and other
   interactions in areas of sympatry may have knock-on effects on
   speciation both within and outside regions of hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{The Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) is a globally complete collection
   of digital outlines of glaciers, excluding the ice sheets, developed to
   meet the needs of the Fifth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change for estimates of past and future mass balance. The RGI
   was created with limited resources in a short period. Priority was given
   to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is
   attached to each of the similar to 198 000 glaciers in its latest
   version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999-2010 provided most of the
   outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800 +/- 34 000 km(2).
   The uncertainty, about +/- 5\%, is derived from careful single-glacier
   and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories
   that were not sources for the RGI. The main contributors to uncertainty
   are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover.
   These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them
   reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models,
   the RGI glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with
   atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of
   climatic change on glaciers. The RGI has already proved its value in the
   generation of significantly improved aggregate estimates of glacier mass
   changes and total volume, and thus actual and potential contributions to
   sea-level rise.}},

Title = {{The conservation status of the world's reptiles}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{372-385}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Effective and targeted conservation action requires detailed information
   about species, their distribution, systematics and ecology as well as
   the distribution of threat processes which affect them. Knowledge of
   reptilian diversity remains surprisingly disparate, and innovative means
   of gaining rapid insight into the status of reptiles are needed in order
   to highlight urgent conservation cases and inform environmental policy
   with appropriate biodiversity information in a timely manner. We present
   the first ever global analysis of extinction risk in reptiles, based on
   a random representative sample of 1500 species (16\% of all currently
   known species). To our knowledge, our results provide the first analysis
   of the global conservation status and distribution patterns of reptiles
   and the threats affecting them, highlighting conservation priorities and
   knowledge gaps which need to be addressed urgently to ensure the
   continued survival of the world's reptiles. Nearly one in five reptilian
   species are threatened with extinction, with another one in five species
   classed as Data Deficient. The proportion of threatened reptile species
   is highest in freshwater environments, tropical regions and on oceanic
   islands, while data deficiency was highest in tropical areas, such as
   Central Africa and Southeast Asia, and among fossorial reptiles. Our
   results emphasise the need for research attention to be focussed on
   tropical areas which are experiencing the most dramatic rates of habitat
   loss, on fossorial reptiles for which there is a chronic lack of data,
   and on certain taxa such as snakes for which extinction risk may
   currently be underestimated due to lack of population information.
   Conservation actions specifically need to mitigate the effects of
   human-induced habitat loss and harvesting, which are the predominant
   threats to reptiles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Almost all land plants form symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal
   fungi. These below-ground fungi play a key role in terrestrial
   ecosystems as they regulate nutrient and carbon cycles, and influence
   soil structure and ecosystem multifunctionality. Up to 80\% of plant N
   and P is provided by mycorrhizal fungi and many plant species depend on
   these symbionts for growth and survival. Estimates suggest that there
   are c. 50000 fungal species that form mycorrhizal associations with c.
   250000 plant species. The development of high-throughput molecular tools
   has helped us to better understand the biology, evolution, and
   biodiversity of mycorrhizal associations. Nuclear genome assemblies and
   gene annotations of 33 mycorrhizal fungal species are now available
   providing fascinating opportunities to deepen our understanding of the
   mycorrhizal lifestyle, the metabolic capabilities of these plant
   symbionts, the molecular dialogue between symbionts, and evolutionary
   adaptations across a range of mycorrhizal associations. Large-scale
   molecular surveys have provided novel insights into the diversity,
   spatial and temporal dynamics of mycorrhizal fungal communities. At the
   ecological level, network theory makes it possible to analyze
   interactions between plant-fungal partners as complex underground
   multi-species networks. Our analysis suggests that nestedness,
   modularity and specificity of mycorrhizal networks vary and depend on
   mycorrhizal type. Mechanistic models explaining partner choice, resource
   exchange, and coevolution in mycorrhizal associations have been
   developed and are being tested. This review ends with major frontiers
   for further research.}},

Title = {{Identification of 100 fundamental ecological questions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{58-67}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Fundamental ecological research is both intrinsically interesting and
   provides the basic knowledge required to answer applied questions of
   importance to the management of the natural world. The 100th anniversary
   of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to
   reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward
   to high-light priorities for future work.
   2. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental
   importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists
   working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754
   questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388
   participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of
   discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done
   during a two-day workshop and thereafter.
   3. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and
   technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions
   concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem
   interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution.
   4. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging.
   For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and
   micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change
   reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been
   foreseen a few decades ago.
   5. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed
   ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as
   the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution.
   6. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of
   ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead
   to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with
   practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem
   function.}},

Title = {{The ecoinvent database version 3 (part I): overview and methodology}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Good background data are an important requirement in LCA. Practitioners
   generally make use of LCI databases for such data, and the ecoinvent
   database is the largest transparent unit-process LCI database worldwide.
   Since its first release in 2003, it has been continuously updated, and
   version 3 was published in 2013. The release of version 3 introduced
   several significant methodological and technological improvements,
   besides a large number of new and updated datasets. The aim was to
   expand the content of the database, set the foundation for a truly
   global database, support regionalized LCIA, offer multiple system
   models, allow for easier integration of data from different regions, and
   reduce maintenance efforts. This article describes the methodological
   developments.
   Modeling choices and raw data were separated in version 3, which enables
   the application of different sets of modeling choices, or system models,
   to the same raw data with little effort. This includes one system model
   for Consequential LCA. Flow properties were added to all exchanges in
   the database, giving more information on the inventory and allowing a
   fast calculation of mass and other balances. With version 3.1, the
   database is generally water-balanced, and water use and consumption can
   be determined. Consumption mixes called market datasets were
   consistently added to the database, and global background data was
   added, often as an extrapolation from regional data.
   In combination with hundreds of new unit processes from regions outside
   Europe, these changes lead to an improved modeling of global supply
   chains, and a more realistic distribution of impacts in regionalized
   LCIA. The new mixes also facilitate further regionalization due to the
   availability of background data for all regions.
   With version 3, the ecoinvent database substantially expands the goals
   and scopes of LCA studies it can support. The new system models allow
   new, different studies to be performed. Global supply chains and market
   datasets significantly increase the relevance of the database outside of
   Europe, and regionalized LCA is supported by the data. Datasets are more

   balances. The developments also support easier collaboration with other
   database initiatives, as demonstrated by a first successful
   collaboration with a data project in Qu,bec. Version 3 has set the
   foundation for expanding ecoinvent from a mostly regional into a truly
   global database and offers many new insights beyond the thousands of new

Abstract = {{Phylogeny has long informed pteridophyte classification. As our ability
   to infer evolutionary trees has improved, classifications aimed at
   recognizing natural groups have become increasingly predictive and
   stable. Here, we provide a modern, comprehensive classification for
   lycophytes and ferns, down to the genus level, utilizing a
   community-based approach. We use monophyly as the primary criterion for
   the recognition of taxa, but also aim to preserve existing taxa and
   circumscriptions that are both widely accepted and consistent with our
   understanding of pteridophyte phylogeny. In total, this classification
   treats an estimated 11 916 species in 337 genera, 51 families, 14
   orders, and two classes. This classification is not intended as the
   final word on lycophyte and fern taxonomy, but rather a summary
   statement of current hypotheses, derived from the best available data
   and shaped by those most familiar with the plants in question. We hope
   that it will serve as a resource for those wanting references to the
   recent literature on pteridophyte phylogeny and classification, a
   framework for guiding future investigations, and a stimulus to further
   discourse.}},

Title = {{Current state of glaciers in the tropical Andes: a multi-century
   perspective on glacier evolution and climate change}},
Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{81-102}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to provide the community with a comprehensive
   overview of the studies of glaciers in the tropical Andes conducted in
   recent decades leading to the current status of the glaciers in the
   context of climate change. In terms of changes in surface area and
   length, we show that the glacier retreat in the tropical Andes over the
   last three decades is unprecedented since the maximum extension of the
   Little Ice Age (LIA, mid-17th-early 18th century). In terms of changes
   in mass balance, although there have been some sporadic gains on several
   glaciers, we show that the trend has been quite negative over the past
   50 yr, with a mean mass balance deficit for glaciers in the tropical
   Andes that is slightly more negative than the one computed on a global
   scale. A break point in the trend appeared in the late 1970s with mean
   annual mass balance per year decreasing from -0.2mw. e. in the period
   1964-1975 to -0.76mw. e. in the period 1976-2010. In addition, even if
   glaciers are currently retreating everywhere in the tropical Andes, it
   should be noted that this is much more pronounced on small glaciers at
   low altitudes that do not have a permanent accumulation zone, and which
   could disappear in the coming years/decades. Monthly mass balance
   measurements performed in Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia show that
   variability of the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean is the main
   factor governing variability of the mass balance at the decadal
   timescale. Precipitation did not display a significant trend in the
   tropical Andes in the 20th century, and consequently cannot explain the
   glacier recession. On the other hand, temperature increased at a
   significant rate of 0.10 degrees C decade(-1) in the last 70 yr. The
   higher frequency of El Nino events and changes in its spatial and
   temporal occurrence since the late 1970s together with a warming
   troposphere over the tropical Andes may thus explain much of the recent
   dramatic shrinkage of glaciers in this part of the world.}},

   popular in the past decade. In particular when glacier outlines are used

   appropriate reference data (e.g. from higher-resolution sensors) are
   seldom available. Moreover, after the required manual correction of the
   raw outlines (e.g. for debris cover), such a comparison would only
   reveal the accuracy of the analyst rather than of the algorithm applied.
   Here we compare outlines for clean and debris-covered glaciers, as
   derived from single and multiple digitizing by different or the same
   analysts on very high- (1 m) and medium-resolution (30 m) remote-sensing
   data, against each other and to glacier outlines derived from automated
   classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper data. Results show a high
   variability in the interpretation of debris-covered glacier parts,
   largely independent of the spatial resolution (area differences were up
   to 30\%), and an overall good agreement for clean ice with sufficient
   contrast to the surrounding terrain (differences similar to 5\%). The
   differences of the automatically derived outlines from a reference value
   are as small as the standard deviation of the manual digitizations from
   several analysts. Based on these results, we conclude that automated
   mapping of clean ice is preferable to manual digitization and recommend
   using the latter method only for required corrections of incorrectly
   mapped glacier parts (e.g. debris cover, shadow).}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that accounting for intraspecific trait
   variation (ITV) may better address major questions in community ecology.
   However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to
   interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing.
   Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within
   and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629
   communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for
   25\% of the total trait variation within communities and 32\% of the
   total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent
   of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs.
   organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P
   concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness)
   traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species
   richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or
   climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative
   importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines
   for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and
   ecosystem studies.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits of organic farming to biodiversity in agricultural
   landscapes continue to be hotly debated, emphasizing the importance of
   precisely quantifying the effect of organic vs. conventional farming. We
   conducted an updated hierarchical meta-analysis of studies that compared
   biodiversity under organic and conventional farming methods, measured as
   species richness. We calculated effect sizes for 184 observations
   garnered from 94 studies, and for each study, we obtained three
   standardized measures reflecting land-use intensity. We investigated the
   stability of effect sizes through time, publication bias due to the
   `file drawer' problem, and consider whether the current literature is
   representative of global organic farming patterns. On average, organic
   farming increased species richness by about 30\%. This result has been
   robust over the last 30years of published studies and shows no sign of
   diminishing. Organic farming had a greater effect on biodiversity as the
   percentage of the landscape consisting of arable fields increased, that
   is, it is higher in intensively farmed regions. The average effect size
   and the response to agricultural intensification depend on taxonomic
   group, functional group and crop type. There is some evidence for
   publication bias in the literature; however, our results are robust to
   its impact. Current studies are heavily biased towards northern and
   western Europe and North America, while other regions with large areas
   of organic farming remain poorly investigated. Synthesis and
   applications. Our analysis affirms that organic farming has large
   positive effects on biodiversity compared with conventional farming, but
   that the effect size varies with the organism group and crop studied,
   and is greater in landscapes with higher land-use intensity. Decisions
   about where to site organic farms to maximize biodiversity will,
   however, depend on the costs as well as the potential benefits. Current
   studies have been heavily biased towards agricultural systems in the
   developed world. We recommend that future studies pay greater attention
   to other regions, in particular, areas with tropical, subtropical and
   Mediterranean climates, in which very few studies have been conducted.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid climate warming in the tundra biome has been linked to increasing

   analyse circumpolar data from 37 Arctic and alpine sites in 9 countries,
   including 25 species, and similar to 42,000 annual growth records from
   1,821 individuals. Our analyses demonstrate that the sensitivity of
   shrub growth to climate was: (1) heterogeneous, with European sites
   showing greater summer temperature sensitivity than North American
   sites, and (2) higher at sites with greater soil moisture and for taller
   shrubs (for example, alders and willows) growing at their northern or
   upper elevational range edges. Across latitude, climate sensitivity of
   growth was greatest at the boundary between the Low and High Arctic,
   where permafrost is thawing(4) and most of the global permafrost soil
   carbon pool is stored(9). The observed variation in climate-shrub growth
   relationships should be incorporated into Earth system models to improve
   future projections of climate change impacts across the tundra biome.}},

Abstract = {{AimLarge trees (d.b.h.70cm) store large amounts of biomass. Several
   studies suggest that large trees may be vulnerable to changing climate,
   potentially leading to declining forest biomass storage. Here we
   determine the importance of large trees for tropical forest biomass
   storage and explore which intrinsic (species trait) and extrinsic
   (environment) variables are associated with the density of large trees
   and forest biomass at continental and pan-tropical scales.
   LocationPan-tropical.
   MethodsAboveground biomass (AGB) was calculated for 120 intact lowland
   moist forest locations. Linear regression was used to calculate
   variation in AGB explained by the density of large trees. Akaike
   information criterion weights (AICc-wi) were used to calculate averaged
   correlation coefficients for all possible multiple regression models
   between AGB/density of large trees and environmental and species trait
   variables correcting for spatial autocorrelation.
   ResultsDensity of large trees explained c. 70\% of the variation in
   pan-tropical AGB and was also responsible for significantly lower AGB in
   Neotropical {[}287.8 (mean)105.0 (SD) Mg ha(-1)] versus Palaeotropical
   forests (Africa 418.3 +/- 91.8 Mg ha(-1); Asia 393.3 +/- 109.3 Mg
   ha(-1)). Pan-tropical variation in density of large trees and AGB was
   associated with soil coarseness (negative), soil fertility (positive),
   community wood density (positive) and dominance of wind dispersed
   species (positive), temperature in the coldest month (negative),
   temperature in the warmest month (negative) and rainfall in the wettest
   month (positive), but results were not always consistent among
   continents.
   Main conclusionsDensity of large trees and AGB were significantly
   associated with climatic variables, indicating that climate change will
   affect tropical forest biomass storage. Species trait composition will
   interact with these future biomass changes as they are also affected by
   a warmer climate. Given the importance of large trees for variation in
   AGB across the tropics, and their sensitivity to climate change, we
   emphasize the need for in-depth analyses of the community dynamics of
   large trees.}},

Abstract = {{The Leguminosae, the third-largest angiosperm family, has a global
   distribution and high ecological and economic importance. We examine how
   the legume systematic research community might join forces to produce a
   comprehensive phylogenetic estimate for the ca. 751 genera and ca.
   19,500 species of legumes and then translate it into a phylogeny-based
   classification. We review the current state of knowledge of legume
   phylogeny and highlight where problems lie, for example in taxon
   sampling and phylogenetic resolution. We review approaches from
   bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing, which can facilitate the
   production of better phylogenetic estimates Finally, we examine how
   morphology can be incorporated into legume phylogeny to address issues
   in comparative biology and classification. Our goal is to stimulate the
   research needed to improve our knowledge of legume phylogeny and
   evolution; the approaches that we discuss may also be relevant to other
   species-rich angiosperm clades.}},

Abstract = {{Because most plants rely on animals for pollination, insights from
   animal sensory ecology and behavior are essential for understanding the
   evolution of flowers. In this review, we compare and contrast three main
   types of pollinator responses to floral signals - receiver bias,
   `adaptive' innate preferences, and associative learning - and discuss
   how they can shape selection on floral signals. We show that
   pollinator-mediated selection on floral signals can be strong and that
   the molecular bases of floral signal variation are often surprisingly
   simple. These new empirical and conceptual insights into
   pollinator-mediated evolution provide a framework for understanding
   patterns of both convergent (pollination syndromes) and advergent
   (floral mimicry) floral signal evolution.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The global loss of biodiversity continues at an alarming rate. Genomic
   approaches have been suggested as a promising tool for conservation
   practice as scaling up to genome-wide data can improve traditional
   conservation genetic inferences and provide qualitatively novel
   insights. However, the generation of genomic data and subsequent
   analyses and interpretations remain challenging and largely confined to
   academic research in ecology and evolution. This generates a gap between
   basic research and applicable solutions for conservation managers faced
   with multifaceted problems. Before the real-world conservation potential
   of genomic research can be realized, we suggest that current
   infrastructures need to be modified, methods must mature, analytical
   pipelines need to be developed, and successful case studies must be
   disseminated to practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{Observations show that glaciers around the world are in retreat and
   losing mass. Internationally coordinated for over a century, glacier
   monitoring activities provide an unprecedented dataset of glacier
   observations from ground, air and space. Glacier studies generally
   select specific parts of these datasets to obtain optimal assessments of
   the mass-balance data relating to the impact that glaciers exercise on
   global sea-level fluctuations or on regional runoff. In this study we
   provide an overview and analysis of the main observational datasets
   compiled by the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS). The dataset on
   glacier front variations (similar to 42 000 since 1600) delivers clear
   evidence that centennial glacier retreat is a global phenomenon.
   Intermittent readvance periods at regional and decadal scale are
   normally restricted to a subsample of glaciers and have not come close
   to achieving the maximum positions of the Little Ice Age (or Holocene).
   Glaciological and geodetic observations (similar to 5200 since 1850)
   show that the rates of early 21st-century mass loss are without
   precedent on a global scale, at least for the time period observed and
   probably also for recorded history, as indicated also in reconstructions
   from written and illustrated documents. This strong imbalance implies
   that glaciers in many regions will very likely suffer further ice loss,
   even if climate remains stable.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerating rates of environmental change and the continued loss of
   global biodiversity threaten functions and services delivered by
   ecosystems. Much ecosystem monitoring and management is focused on the
   provision of ecosystem functions and services under current
   environmental conditions, yet this could lead to inappropriate
   management guidance and undervaluation of the importance of
   biodiversity. The maintenance of ecosystem functions and services under
   substantial predicted future environmental change (i.e., their
   `resilience') is crucial. Here we identify a range of mechanisms
   underpinning the resilience of ecosystem functions across three
   ecological scales. Although potentially less important in the short
   term, biodiversity, encompassing variation from within species to across
   landscapes, may be crucial for the longer-term resilience of ecosystem
   functions and the services that they underpin.}},

Abstract = {{The significance of root exudates as belowground defense substances has
   long been underestimated, presumably due to being buried out of sight.
   Nevertheless, this chapter of root biology has been progressively
   addressed within the past decade through the characterization of novel
   constitutively secreted and inducible phytochemicals that directly
   repel, inhibit, or kill pathogenic microorganisms in the rhizosphere. In
   addition, the complex transport machinery involved in their export has
   been considerably unraveled. It has become evident that the profile of
   defense root exudates is not only diverse in its composition, but also
   strikingly dynamic. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the
   nature and regulation of root-secreted defense compounds and the role of
   transport proteins in modulating their release.}},

Abstract = {{Intercropping is a farming practice involving two or more crop species,
   or genotypes, growing together and coexisting for a time. On the fringes
   of modern intensive agriculture, intercropping is important in many
   subsistence or low-input/resource-limited agricultural systems. By
   allowing genuine yield gains without increased inputs, or greater
   stability of yield with decreased inputs, intercropping could be one
   route to delivering sustainable intensification'. We discuss how recent
   knowledge from agronomy, plant physiology and ecology can be combined
   with the aim of improving intercropping systems. Recent advances in
   agronomy and plant physiology include better understanding of the
   mechanisms of interactions between crop genotypes and species - for
   example, enhanced resource availability through niche complementarity.
   Ecological advances include better understanding of the
   context-dependency of interactions, the mechanisms behind disease and
   pest avoidance, the links between above- and below-ground systems, and
   the role of microtopographic variation in coexistence. This improved
   understanding can guide approaches for improving intercropping systems,
   including breeding crops for intercropping. Although such advances can
   help to improve intercropping systems, we suggest that other topics also
   need addressing. These include better assessment of the wider benefits
   of intercropping in terms of multiple ecosystem services, collaboration
   with agricultural engineering, and more effective interdisciplinary
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Plants in most biomes are thought to be living at their hydraulic
   limits, and alterations to precipitation patterns consistent with
   climate change trends are causing die-back in forests across the
   globe(1-4). However, within- and among-species variation in plant traits
   that promote persistence and adaptation under these new rainfall regimes
   may reduce mortality in these changing climates(5,6). Storage of
   non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) is posited as an important trait for
   resistance and resilience of forests to climate-change-induced drought,
   but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear(7-10). Here we demonstrate
   a positive relationship between NSCs and drought survival by
   manipulating NSC concentrations within seedlings of ten tropical tree
   species. Seedlings experimentally enriched in NSCs showed higher stem
   water potentials and sustained NSCs during drought. NSC use for
   maintenance of osmoregulation and hydraulic function therefore seems to
   underlie improved drought resistance. That drought mortality is delayed
   by higher NSC concentrations has implications for predicting the impacts
   of climate change on forest die-back(2,4) and may help focus restoration
   efforts on species that increase the resistance and resilience of
   forests to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is a global phenomenon, and its outcomes affect societies
   around the world. So far, however, studies on media representations of
   climate change have mostly concentrated on Western societies. This paper
   goes beyond this limited geographical scope by presenting a comparative
   analysis of issue attention in 27 countries. The sample includes, among
   others, countries that have committed themselves to greenhouse gas
   emission reductions under the Kyoto Protocol such as Germany as well as
   countries that are strongly affected by the consequences of climate
   change like India. In a first step, it describes the development of
   media attention for climate change in these countries from 1996 to 2010.
   Second, it compares the amount of media attention and explores whether
   it corresponds with indicators measuring the relevance of climate change
   and climate policies for a country. The analyses show that climate
   change coverage has increased in all countries. Still, overall media
   attention levels, as well as the extent of growth over time, differ
   strongly between countries. Media attention is especially high in carbon
   dependent countries with commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper and this issue attempt to address how, when and why the
   phenomenal c. 100,000 species of seed plants in tropical America (the
   Neotropics) arose. It is increasingly clear that an approach focusing on
   individual major biomes rather than a single aggregate view is useful
   because of evidence for differing diversification histories among
   biomes. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that Neotropical-scale
   diversification patterns are structured more ecologically than
   geographically, with a key role for phylogenetic niche or biome
   conservatism. Lower geographical structure reflects the fact that
   long-distance dispersal, inferred from dated phylogenetic trees, has
   overcome many supposed dispersal barriers. Overall, high rates of
   species turnover as inferred from palaeontological and molecular data
   have been the hallmark of plant evolutionary dynamics in the Neotropics
   throughout the Cenozoic, with most extant species diversity post-dating
   the Mid- to Late Miocene, perhaps reflecting the conjunction of both
   global climatic changes and geological upheavals such as the Neogene
   uplift of the tropical Andes. Future studies of Neotropical
   diversification will be facilitated by taxonomically and genetically
   better sampled phylogenetic analyses, their integration with
   palaeontological, geological and ecological data, and improved methods
   to estimate biogeographic history and diversification dynamics at
   different spatial and temporal scales. Future biome-focused approaches
   would benefit greatly from better delimitation and mapping of
   Neotropical biomes. (c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London}},

Abstract = {{Glacier mass changes are a valuable indicator of climate variability and
   monsoon oscillation on the underexplored Tibetan Plateau. In this study
   data from the Ice Cloud and Elevation Satellite (ICESat) is employed to
   estimate elevation and mass changes of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau
   between 2003 and 2009. In order to get a representative sample size of
   ICESat measurements, glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau were grouped into
   eight climatically homogeneous sub-regions. Most negative mass budgets
   of -0.77 +/- 0.35m w.e.a(-1) were found for the Qilian Mountains and
   eastern Kunlun Mountains while a mass gain of +0.37 +/- 0.25m w.e.a(-1)
   was found in the westerly-dominated north-central part of the Tibetan
   Plateau. A total annual mass budget of -15.6 +/- 10.1 Gt a(-1) was
   estimated for the eight sub-regions sufficiently covered by ICESat data
   which represents similar to 80\% of the glacier area on the Tibetan
   Plateau. 13.9 +/- 8.9 Gt a(-1) (or 0.04 +/- 0.02 mm a(-1) sea-level
   equivalent) of the total mass budget contributed `directly' to the
   global sea-level rise while 1.7 +/- 1.9 Gt a(-1) drained into endorheic
   basins on the plateau.}},

Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{9-34}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A global overview of glacier advances and retreats (grouped by regions
   and by millennia) for the Holocene is compiled from previous studies.
   The reconstructions of glacier fluctuations are based on 1) mapping and
   dating moraines defined by C-14, TCN, OSL, lichenometry and tree rings
   (discontinuous records/time series), and 2) sediments from proglacial
   lakes and speleothems (continuous records/time series). Using 189
   continuous and discontinuous time series, the long-term trends and
   centennial fluctuations of glaciers were compared to trends in the
   recession of Northern and mountain tree lines, and with orbital, solar
   and volcanic studies to examine the likely forcing factors that drove
   the changes recorded. A general trend of increasing glacier size from
   the early-mid Holocene, to the late Holocene in the extra-tropical areas
   of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is related to overall summer
   temperature, forced by orbitally-controlled insolation. The glaciers in
   New Zealand and in the tropical Andes also appear to follow the orbital
   trend, i.e., they were decreasing from the early Holocene to the
   present. In contrast, glacier fluctuations in some monsoonal areas of
   Asia and southern South America generally did not follow the orbital
   trends, but fluctuated at a higher frequency possibly triggered by
   distinct teleconnections patterns. During the Neoglacial, advances
   clustered at 4.4-4.2 ka, 3.8-3.4 ka, 3.3-2.8 ka, 2.6 ka, 2.3-2.1 ka,
   1.5-1.4 ka, 12-1.0 ka, 0.7-0.5 ka, corresponding to general cooling
   periods in the North Atlantic. Some of these episodes coincide with
   multidecadal periods of low solar activity, but it is unclear what
   mechanism might link small changes in irradiance to widespread glacier
   fluctuations. Explosive volcanism may have played a role in some periods
   of glacier advances, such as around 1.7-1.6 ka (coinciding with the
   Taupo volcanic eruption at 232 +/- 5 CE) but the record of explosive
   volcanism is poorly known through the Holocene. The compilation of ages
   suggests that there is no single mechanism driving glacier fluctuations
   on a global scale. Multidecadal variations of solar and volcanic
   activity supported by positive feedbacks in the climate system may have
   played a critical role in Holocene glaciation, but further research on
   such linkages is needed. The rate and the global character of glacier
   retreat in the 20th through early 21st centuries appears unusual in the
   context of Holocene glaciation, though the retreating glaciers in most
   parts of the Northern Hemisphere are still larger today than they were
   in the early and/or mid-Holocene. The current retreat, however, is
   occurring during an interval of orbital forcing that is favorable for
   glacier growth and is therefore caused by a combination of factors other
   than orbital forcing, primarily strong anthropogenic effects. Glacier
   retreat will continue into future decades due to the delayed response of
   glaciers. to climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   anthroposphere. Over the past fifteen years, dynamic MFA has contributed
   to increased knowledge about the quantities, qualities, and locations of
   metal-containing goods. This article presents a literature review of the
   methodologies applied in 60 dynamic MFAs of metals. The review is based
   on a standardized model description format, the ODD (overview, design
   concepts, details) protocol. We focus on giving a. comprehensive
   overview of modeling approaches and structure them according to
   essential aspects, such as their treatment of material dissipation,
   spatial dimension of flows, or data uncertainty. The reviewed literature
   features similar basic modeling principles but very diverse
   extrapolation methods. Basic principles include the calculation of
   outflows of the in-use stock based on inflow or stock data and a
   lifetime distribution function. For extrapolating stocks and flows,
   authors apply constant, linear, exponential, and logistic models or
   approaches based on socioeconomic variables, such as regression models
   or the intensity-of-use hypothesis. The consideration and treatment of
   further aspects, such as dissipation, spatial distribution, and data
   uncertainty, vary significantly and highly depends on the objectives of
   each study.}},

Abstract = {{The study of islands as model systems has played an important role in
   the development of evolutionary and ecological theory. The 50th
   anniversary of MacArthur and Wilson's (December 1963) article, An
   equilibrium theory of insular zoogeography', was a recent milestone for
   this theme. Since 1963, island systems have provided new insights into
   the formation of ecological communities. Here, building on such
   developments, we highlight prospects for research on islands to improve
   our understanding of the ecology and evolution of communities in
   general. Throughout, we emphasise how attributes of islands combine to
   provide unusual research opportunities, the implications of which
   stretch far beyond islands. Molecular tools and increasing data
   acquisition now permit re-assessment of some fundamental issues that
   interested MacArthur and Wilson. These include the formation of
   ecological networks, species abundance distributions, and the
   contribution of evolution to community assembly. We also extend our
   prospects to other fields of ecology and evolution - understanding
   ecosystem functioning, speciation and diversification - frequently
   employing assets of oceanic islands in inferring the geographic area
   within which evolution has occurred, and potential barriers to gene
   flow. Although island-based theory is continually being enriched,
   incorporating non-equilibrium dynamics is identified as a major
   challenge for the future.}},

Title = {{Site occupancy models in the analysis of environmental DNA
   presence/absence surveys: a case study of an emerging amphibian pathogen}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{646-653}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect species in aquatic
   environments such as ponds and streams is a powerful new technique with
   many benefits. However, species detection in eDNA-based surveys is
   likely to be imperfect, which can lead to underestimation of the
   distribution of a species.
   2. Site occupancy models account for imperfect detection and can be used
   to estimate the proportion of sites where a species occurs from
   presence/absence survey data, making them ideal for the analysis of
   eDNA-based surveys. Imperfect detection can result from failure to
   detect the species during field work (e.g. by water samples) or during
   laboratory analysis (e.g. by PCR).
   3. To demonstrate the utility of site occupancy models for eDNA surveys,
   we reanalysed a data set estimating the occurrence of the amphibian
   chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis using eDNA. Our reanalysis
   showed that the previous estimation of species occurrence was low by
   5-10\%. Detection probability was best explained by an index of the
   number of hosts (frogs) in ponds.
   4. Per-visit availability probability in water samples was estimated at
   045 (95\% CRI 032, 058) and per-PCR detection probability at 085 (95\%
   CRI 074, 094), and six water samples from a pond were necessary for a
   cumulative detection probability >95\%. A simulation study showed that
   when using site occupancy analysis, researchers need many fewer samples
   to reliably estimate presence and absence of species than without use of
   site occupancy modelling.
   5. Our analyses demonstrate the benefits of site occupancy models as a
   simple and powerful tool to estimate detection and site occupancy
   (species prevalence) probabilities despite imperfect detection. As
   species detection from eDNA becomes more common, adoption of appropriate
   statistical methods, such as site occupancy models, will become crucial
   to ensure that reliable inferences are made from eDNA-based surveys.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{362-367}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The Earth's climate system is driven by a complex interplay of internal
   chaotic dynamics and natural and anthropogenic external forcing. Recent
   instrumental data have shown a remarkable degree of asynchronicity
   between Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere temperature
   fluctuations, thereby questioning the relative importance of internal
   versus external drivers of past as well as future climate
   variability(1-3). However, large-scale temperature reconstructions for
   the past millennium have focused on the Northern Hemisphere(4,5),
   limiting empirical assessments of inter-hemispheric variability on
   multi-decadal to centennial timescales. Here, we introduce a new
   millennial ensemble reconstruction of annually resolved temperature
   variations for the Southern Hemisphere based on an unprecedented network
   of terrestrial and oceanic palaeoclimate proxy records. In conjunction
   with an independent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction
   ensemble(5), this record reveals an extended cold period (1594-1677) in
   both hemispheres but no globally coherent warm phase during the
   pre-industrial (1000-1850) era. The current (post-1974) warm phase is
   the only period of the past millennium where both hemispheres are likely
   to have experienced contemporaneous warm extremes. Our analysis of
   inter-hemispheric temperature variability in an ensemble of climate
   model simulations for the past millennium suggests that models tend to
   overemphasize Northern Hemisphere-Southern Hemisphere synchronicity by
   underestimating the role of internal ocean-atmosphere dynamics,
   particularly in the ocean-dominated Southern Hemisphere. Our results
   imply that climate system predictability on decadal to century
   timescales may be lower than expected based on assessments of external
   climate forcing and Northern Hemisphere temperature variations(5,6)
   alone.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation belongs to the components of the Earth surface, which are
   most extensively studied using historic and present satellite records.
   Recently, these records exceeded a 30-year time span composed of
   preprocessed fortnightly observations (1981-2011). The existence of
   monotonic changes and trend shifts present in such records has
   previously been demonstrated. However, information on timing and type of
   such trend shifts was lacking at global scale. In this work, we detected
   major shifts in vegetation activity trends and their associated type
   (either interruptions or reversals) and timing. It appeared that the
   biospheric trend shifts have, over time, increased in frequency,
   confirming recent findings of increased turnover rates in vegetated
   areas. Signs of greening-to-browning reversals around the millennium
   transition were found in many regions (Patagonia, the Sahel, northern
   Kazakhstan, among others), as well as negative
   interruptions-{''}setbacks{''}-in greening trends (southern Africa,
   India, Asia Minor, among others). A minority (26\%) of all significant
   trends appeared monotonic.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental DNA (eDNA) is used to detect biodiversity by the capture,
   extraction, and identification of DNA shed to the environment. However,
   eDNA capture and extraction protocols vary widely across studies. This
   use of different protocols potentially biases detection results and
   could significantly hinder a reliable use of eDNA to detect
   biodiversity. We tested whether choice of eDNA capture and extraction
   protocols significantly influenced biodiversity detection in aquatic
   systems. We sampled lake and river water, captured and extracted eDNA
   using six combinations of different protocols with replication, and
   tested for the detection of four macroinvertebrate species.
   Additionally, using the same lake water technical replicates, we
   compared the effect of capture and extraction protocols on metabarcode
   detections of biodiversity using 16S for eubacteria and cytochrome c
   oxidase I (COI) for eukaryotes. Protocol combinations for capture and
   extraction of eDNA significantly influenced DNA yield and number of
   sequences obtained from next generation sequencing. We found
   significantly different detection rates of species ranging from zero
   percent to thirty-three percent. Differences in which protocol
   combinations produced the highest metabarcoded biodiversity were
   detected and demonstrate that different protocols are required for
   different biodiversity targets. Our results highlight that the choice of
   molecular protocols used for capture and extraction of eDNA from water
   can strongly affect biodiversity detection. Consideration of biases
   caused by choice of protocols should lead to a more consistent and
   reliable molecular workflow for repeatable and increased detection of
   biodiversity in aquatic communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Review of optical-based remote sensing for plant trait mapping}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Plant trait data have been used in various studies related to ecosystem
   functioning, community ecology, and assessment of ecosystem services.
   Evidences are that plant scientists agree on a set of key plant traits,
   which are relatively easy to measure and have a stable and strong
   predictive response to ecosystem functions. However, the field
   measurements of plant trait data are still limited to small area, to a
   certain moment in time and to certain number of species only. Therefore,
   remote sensing (RS) offers potential to complement or even replace field
   measurements of some plant traits. It offers instantaneous spatially
   contiguous information, covers larger areas and in case of satellite
   observations profits from their revisit capacity.
   In this review, we first introduce RS concepts of light-vegetation
   interactions, RS instruments for vegetation studies, RS methods, and
   scaling between field and RS observations. Further we discuss in detail
   current achievements and challenges of optical RS for mapping of key
   plant traits. We concentrate our discussion on three categorical plant
   traits (plant growth and life forms, flammability properties and
   photosynthetic pathways and activity) and on five continuous plant
   traits (plant height, leaf phenology, leaf mass per area, nitrogen and
   phosphorous concentration or content). We review existing literature to
   determine the retrieval accuracy of the continuous plant traits. The
   relative estimation error using RS ranged between 10\% and 45\% of
   measured mean value, i.e. around 10\% for plant height of tall canopies,
   20\% for plant height of short canopies, 15\% for plant nitrogen, 25\%
   for plant phosphorus content/concentration, and 45\% for leaf mass per
   area estimates.
   The potential of RS to map plant traits is particularly high when traits
   are related to leaf biochemistry, photosynthetic processes and canopy
   structure. There are also other plant traits, i.e. leaf chlorophyll
   content, water content and leaf area index, which can be retrieved from
   optical RS well and can be of importance for plant scientists.
   We underline the need that future assessments of ecosystem functioning
   using RS should require comprehensive and integrated measurements of
   various plant traits together with leaf and canopy spectral properties.
   By doing so, the interplay between plant structural, physiological,
   biochemical, phenological and spectral properties can be better
   understood. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Designing forest biodiversity experiments: general considerations
   illustrated by a new large experiment in subtropical China}},

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{1. Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiments address
   ecosystem-level consequences of species loss by comparing communities of
   high species richness with communities from which species have been
   gradually eliminated. BEF experiments originally started with microcosms
   in the laboratory and with grassland ecosystems. A new frontier in
   experimental BEF research is manipulating tree diversity in forest
   ecosystems, compelling researchers to think big and comprehensively.
   2. We present and discuss some of the major issues to be considered in
   the design of BEF experiments with trees and illustrate these with a new
   forest biodiversity experiment established in subtropical China
   (Xingangshan, Jiangxi Province) in 2009/2010. Using a pool of 40 tree
   species, extinction scenarios were simulated with tree richness levels
   of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 species on a total of 566 plots of 25.8x25.8m each.
   3. The goal of this experiment is to estimate effects of tree and shrub
   species richness on carbon storage and soil erosion; therefore, the
   experiment was established on sloped terrain. The following important
   design choices were made: (i) establishing many small rather than fewer
   larger plots, (ii) using high planting density and random mixing of
   species rather than lower planting density and patchwise mixing of
   species, (iii) establishing a map of the initial ecoscape' to
   characterize site heterogeneity before the onset of biodiversity effects
   and (iv) manipulating tree species richness not only in random but also
   in trait-oriented extinction scenarios.
   4. Data management and analysis are particularly challenging in BEF
   experiments with their hierarchical designs nesting individuals
   within-species populations within plots within-species compositions.
   Statistical analysis best proceeds by partitioning these random terms
   into fixed-term contrasts, for example, species composition into
   contrasts for species richness and the presence of particular functional
   groups, which can then be tested against the remaining random variation
   among compositions.
   5. We conclude that forest BEF experiments provide exciting and timely
   research options. They especially require careful thinking to allow
   multiple disciplines to measure and analyse data jointly and
   effectively. Achieving specific research goals and synergy with previous
   experiments involves trade-offs between different designs and requires
   manifold design decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological stability is touted as a complex and multifaceted concept,
   including components such as variability, resistance, resilience,
   persistence and robustness. Even though a complete appreciation of the
   effects of perturbations on ecosystems requires the simultaneous
   measurement of these multiple components of stability, most ecological
   research has focused on one or a few of those components analysed in
   isolation. Here, we present a new view of ecological stability that
   recognises explicitly the non-independence of components of stability.
   This provides an approach for simplifying the concept of stability. We
   illustrate the concept and approach using results from a field
   experiment, and show that the effective dimensionality of ecological
   stability is considerably lower than if the various components of
   stability were unrelated. However, strong perturbations can modify, and
   even decouple, relationships among individual components of stability.
   Thus, perturbations not only increase the dimensionality of stability
   but they can also alter the relationships among components of stability
   in different ways. Studies that focus on single forms of stability in
   isolation therefore risk underestimating significantly the potential of
   perturbations to destabilise ecosystems. In contrast, application of the
   multidimensional stability framework that we propose gives a far richer
   understanding of how communities respond to perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{Cytokinins are classic plant hormones that orchestrate plant growth,
   development, and physiology. They affect gene expression in target cells
   by activating a multistep phosphorelay network. Type-B response
   regulators, acting as transcriptional activators, mediate the final step
   in the signaling cascade. Previously, we have introduced a synthetic
   reporter, Two Component signaling Sensor (TCS)::green fluorescent
   protein (GFP), which reflects the transcriptional activity of type-B
   response regulators. TCS:: GFP was instrumental in uncovering roles of
   cytokinin and deepening our understanding of existing functions.
   However, TCS-mediated expression of reporters is weak in some
   developmental contexts where cytokinin signaling has a documented role,
   such as in the shoot apical meristem or in the vasculature of
   Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We also observed that GFP expression
   becomes rapidly silenced in TCS:: GFP transgenic plants. Here, we
   present an improved version of the reporter, TCS new (TCSn), which,
   compared with TCS, is more sensitive to phosphorelay signaling in
   Arabidopsis and maize (Zea mays) cellular assays while retaining its
   specificity. Transgenic Arabidopsis TCSn:: GFP plants exhibit strong and
   dynamic GFP expression patterns consistent with known cytokinin
   functions. In addition, GFP expression has been stable over generations,
   allowing for crosses with different genetic backgrounds. Thus, TCSn
   represents a significant improvement to report the transcriptional
   output profile of phosphorelay signaling networks in Arabidopsis, maize,
   and likely other plants that display common response regulator
   DNA-binding specificities.}},

Abstract = {{As biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, an important
   current scientific challenge is to understand and predict the
   consequences of biodiversity loss. Here, we develop a theory that
   predicts the temporal variability of community biomass from the
   properties of individual component species in monoculture. Our theory
   shows that biodiversity stabilises ecosystems through three main
   mechanisms: (1) asynchrony in species' responses to environmental
   fluctuations, (2) reduced demographic stochasticity due to overyielding
   in species mixtures and (3) reduced observation error (including spatial
   and sampling variability). Parameterised with empirical data from four
   long-term grassland biodiversity experiments, our prediction explained
   2275\% of the observed variability, and captured much of the effect of
   species richness. Richness stabilised communities mainly by increasing
   community biomass and reducing the strength of demographic
   stochasticity. Our approach calls for a re-evaluation of the mechanisms
   explaining the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem stability.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Soil compaction is a major disturbance associated with logging, but we
   lack a fundamental understanding of how this affects the soil
   microbiome. We assessed the structural resistance and resilience of the
   microbiome using a high-throughput pyrosequencing approach in
   differently compacted soils at two forest sites and correlated these
   findings with changes in soil physical properties and functions.
   Alterations in soil porosity after compaction strongly limited the air
   and water conductivity. Compaction significantly reduced abundance,
   increased diversity, and persistently altered the structure of the
   microbiota. Fungi were less resistant and resilient than bacteria;
   clayey soils were less resistant and resilient than sandy soils. The
   strongest effects were observed in soils with unfavorable moisture
   conditions, where air and water conductivities dropped well below 10\%
   of their initial value. Maximum impact was observed around 6-12 months
   after compaction, and microbial communities showed resilience in lightly
   but not in severely compacted soils 4 years post disturbance. Bacteria
   capable of anaerobic respiration, including sulfate, sulfur, and metal
   reducers of the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, were significantly
   associated with compacted soils. Compaction detrimentally affected
   ectomycorrhizal species, whereas saprobic and parasitic fungi
   proportionally increased in compacted soils. Structural shifts in the
   microbiota were accompanied by significant changes in soil processes,
   resulting in reduced carbon dioxide, and increased methane and nitrous
   oxide emissions from compacted soils. This study demonstrates that
   physical soil disturbance during logging induces profound and
   long-lasting changes in the soil microbiome and associated soil
   functions, raising awareness regarding sustainable management of
   economically driven logging operations.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{1227-1245}},
Abstract = {{Glacier-wide mass balance has been measured for more than sixty years
   and is widely used as an indicator of climate change and to assess the
   glacier contribution to runoff and sea level rise. Until recently,
   comprehensive uncertainty assessments have rarely been carried out and
   mass balance data have often been applied using rough error estimation
   or without consideration of errors. In this study, we propose a
   framework for reanalysing glacier mass balance series that includes
   conceptual and statistical toolsets for assessment of random and
   systematic errors, as well as for validation and calibration (if
   necessary) of the glaciological with the geodetic balance results. We
   demonstrate the usefulness and limitations of the proposed scheme,
   drawing on an analysis that comprises over 50 recording periods for a
   dozen glaciers, and we make recommendations to investigators and users
   of glacier mass balance data. Reanalysing glacier mass balance series
   needs to become a standard procedure for every monitoring programme to
   improve data quality, including reliable uncertainty estimates.}},

Abstract = {{The classification of the legume family proposed here addresses the
   long-known non-monophyly of the traditionally recognised subfamily
   Caesalpinioideae, by recognising six robustly supported monophyletic
   subfamilies. This new classification uses as its framework the most
   comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of legumes to date, based on plastid
   matK gene sequences, and including near-complete sampling of genera (698
   of the currently recognised 765 genera) and ca. 20\% (3696) of known
   species. The matK gene region has been the most widely sequenced across
   the legumes, and in most legume lineages, this gene region is
   sufficiently variable to yield well-supported clades. This analysis
   resolves the same major clades as in other phylogenies of whole plastid
   and nuclear gene sets (with much sparser taxon sampling). Our analysis
   improves upon previous studies that have used large phylogenies of the
   Leguminosae for addressing evolutionary questions, because it maximises
   generic sampling and provides a phylogenetic tree that is based on a
   fully curated set of sequences that are vouchered and taxonomically
   validated. The phylogenetic trees obtained and the underlying data are
   available to browse and download, facilitating subsequent analyses that
   require evolutionary trees. Here we propose a new community-endorsed
   classification of the family that reflects the phylogenetic structure
   that is consistently resolved and recognises six subfamilies in
   Leguminosae: a recircumscribed Caesalpinioideae DC., Cercidoideae Legume
   Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.), Detarioideae Burmeist.,
   Dialioideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.),
   Duparquetioideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.), and
   Papilionoideae DC. The traditionally recognised subfamily Mimosoideae is
   a distinct clade nested within the recircumscribed Caesalpinioideae and
   is referred to informally as the mimosoid clade pending a forthcoming
   formal tribal and/or clade-based classification of the new
   Caesalpinioideae. We provide a key for subfamily identification,
   descriptions with diagnostic charactertistics for the subfamilies,
   figures illustrating their floral and fruit diversity, and lists of
   genera by subfamily. This new classification of Leguminosae represents a
   consensus view of the international legume systematics community; it
   invokes both compromise and practicality of use.}},

Abstract = {{The meltwater released by the glaciers in the Aksu-Tarim Catchment,
   south of Tomur Peak (Central Tien Shan), feeds the Tarim River which is
   the main artery for the oases at the northern margin of the Taklamakan
   desert. The correct modeling of the contribution of the glaciers
   meltwater to the total runoff of the Tarim River is hampered by the lack
   of mass balance data. Multi-temporal digital terrain models (DTMs) allow
   the determination of volume changes for large samples of glacier. Here,
   we present the mass changes for 12 glaciers using 1976 KH-9 Hexagon,
   2000 SRTM3 and 2009 SPOT-5 datasets. The results show that most of the
   glaciers have been losing mass since 1976. The largest glaciers, Koxkar
   and West Qongterang, lost -0.27+/-0.15 m w.e.a(-1) and -0.43+/-0.15 m
   w.e.a(-1) between 1976 and 2009, despite thick debris cover. However,
   some smaller glaciers show mass gain at their tongues indicating glacier
   surges. Using SRTM3 data the volume gain of Qinbingtan Glacier No. 74
   could be dated to the time period 1999-2009. The overall mass budget of
   -0.33+/-0.15 m w.e.a(-1) (for 1976-2009) of the investigated glaciers is
   within the variability range of the global average. However, in the
   recent years (1999-2009) a slightly decelerated mass loss of
   -0.23+/-0.19 m w.e.a(-1) could be observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The need for an environmental risk assessment for engineered
   nanomaterials (ENM) necessitates the knowledge about their environmental
   concentrations. Despite significant advances in analytical methods, it
   is still not possible to measure the concentrations of ENM in natural
   systems. Material flow and environmental fate models have been used to
   provide predicted environmental concentrations. However, almost all
   current models are static and consider neither the rapid:development of
   ENM production nor the fact that many ENM are entering an in-use stock
   and are released with a lag phase. Here we use dynamic probabilistic
   material flow modeling, to predict the flows of four ENM (nano-TiO2,
   nano-ZnO, nano-Ag and CNT) to the environment and to quantify their
   amounts in (temporary) sinks such as the in-use stock and
   ({''}final{''}) environmental sinks such as soil and sediment. Caused by
   the increase in production, the concentrations of all ENM in all
   compartments are increasing. Nano-TiO2 had far higher concentrations
   than the other three ENM. Sediment showed in our worst-case scenario
   concentrations ranging from 6.7 mu g/kg (CNT) to about 40 000 mu g/kg
   (nano-TiO2). In most cases the concentrations in waste incineration
   residues are at the ``mg/kg{''} level. The flows to the environment that
   we provide will constitute the most accurate and reliable input of
   masses for environmental fate models which are using process-based
   descriptions of the fate and behavior of ENM in natural systems and rely
   on accurate mass input parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Tree-rings offer one of the few possibilities to empirically quantify

   Contemporaneously with the growing scientific community employing

   dendrochronological sampling) may introduce considerable biases in
   quantifications of forest responses to environmental change. To date, a

   dendroecological and-climatological conclusions has not yet been
   performed. Here, we investigate potential biases by sampling a large
   population of trees and replicating diverse sampling designs. This is
   achieved by retroactively subsetting the population and specifically
   testing for biases emerging for climate reconstruction, growth response
   to climate variability, long-term growth trends, and quantification of
   forest productivity. We find that commonly applied sampling designs can
   impart systematic biases of varying magnitude to any type of
   tree-ring-based investigations, independent of the total number of
   samples considered. Quantifications of forest growth and productivity
   are particularly susceptible to biases, whereas growth responses to
   short-term climate variability are less affected by the choice of
   sampling design. The world's most frequently applied sampling design,
   focusing on dominant trees only, can bias absolute growth rates by up to
   459\% and trends in excess of 200\%. Our findings challenge paradigms,
   where a subset of samples is typically considered to be representative
   for the entire population. The only two sampling strategies meeting the
   requirements for all types of investigations are the (i) sampling of all
   individuals within a fixed area; and (ii) fully randomized selection of
   trees. This result advertises the consistent implementation of a widely
   applicable sampling design to simultaneously reduce uncertainties in
   tree-ring-based quantifications of forest growth and increase the
   comparability of datasets beyond individual studies, investigators,
   laboratories, and geographical boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulation of anthocyanins in the exocarp of red grapevine (Vitis
   vinifera) cultivars is one of several events that characterize the onset
   of grape berry ripening (veraison). Despite our thorough understanding
   of anthocyanin biosynthesis and regulation, little is known about the
   molecular aspects of their transport. The participation of ATP binding
   cassette (ABC) proteins in vacuolar anthocyanin transport has long been
   a matter of debate. Here, we present biochemical evidence that an ABC
   protein, ABCC1, localizes to the tonoplast and is involved in the
   transport of glucosylated anthocyanidins. ABCC1 is expressed in the
   exocarp throughout berry development and ripening, with a significant
   increase at veraison (i.e., the onset of ripening). Transport
   experiments using microsomes isolated from ABCC1-expressing yeast cells
   showed that ABCC1 transports malvidin 3-O-glucoside. The transport
   strictly depends on the presence of GSH, which is cotransported with the
   anthocyanins and is sensitive to inhibitors of ABC proteins. By exposing
   anthocyanin-producing grapevine root cultures to buthionine
   sulphoximine, which reduced GSH levels, a decrease in anthocyanin
   concentration is observed. In conclusion, we provide evidence that ABCC1
   acts as an anthocyanin transporter that depends on GSH without the
   formation of an anthocyanin-GSH conjugate.}},

Title = {{Estimating the normal background rate of species extinction}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{452-462}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A key measure of humanity's global impact is by how much it has
   increased species extinction rates. Familiar statements are that these
   are 100-1000 times pre-human or background extinction levels. Estimating
   recent rates is straightforward, but establishing a background rate for
   comparison is not. Previous researchers chose an approximate benchmark
   of 1 extinction per million species per year (E/MSY). We explored
   disparate lines of evidence that suggest a substantially lower estimate.
   Fossil data yield direct estimates of extinction rates, but they are
   temporally coarse, mostly limited to marine hard-bodied taxa, and
   generally involve genera not species. Based on these data, typical
   background loss is 0.01 genera per million genera per year. Molecular
   phylogenies are available for more taxa and ecosystems, but it is
   debated whether they can be used to estimate separately speciation and
   extinction rates. We selected data to address known concerns and used
   them to determine median extinction estimates from statistical
   distributions of probable values for terrestrial plants and animals. We
   then created simulations to explore effects of violating model
   assumptions. Finally, we compiled estimates of diversificationthe
   difference between speciation and extinction rates for different taxa.
   Median estimates of extinction rates ranged from 0.023 to 0.135 E/MSY.
   Simulation results suggested over- and under-estimation of extinction
   from individual phylogenies partially canceled each other out when large
   sets of phylogenies were analyzed. There was no evidence for recent and
   widespread pre-human overall declines in diversity. This implies that
   average extinction rates are less than average diversification rates.
   Median diversification rates were 0.05-0.2 new species per million
   species per year. On the basis of these results, we concluded that
   typical rates of background extinction may be closer to 0.1 E/MSY. Thus,
   current extinction rates are 1,000 times higher than natural background
   rates of extinction and future rates are likely to be 10,000 times
   higher.}},

Abstract = {{In land plants, chlorophyll is broken down to colorless linear
   tetrapyrroles in a highly conserved multi-step pathway. The pathway is
   termed the `PAO pathway', because the opening of the chlorine macrocycle

   key enzyme of the pathway, provides the characteristic structural basis
   found in all further downstream chlorophyll breakdown products. To date,
   most of the biochemical steps of the PAO pathway have been elucidated
   and genes encoding many of the chlorophyll catabolic enzymes been
   identified. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the
   biochemistry of the PAO pathway and provides insight into recent
   progress made in the field that indicates that the pathway is more
   complex than thought in the past.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades, 3D city models appear to have been predominantly
   used for visualisation; however, today they are being increasingly
   employed in a number of domains and for a large range of tasks beyond
   visualisation. In this paper, we seek to understand and document the
   state of the art regarding the utilisation of 3D city models across
   multiple domains based on a comprehensive literature study including
   hundreds of research papers, technical reports and online resources. A
   challenge in a study such as ours is that the ways in which 3D city
   models are used cannot be readily listed due to fuzziness,
   terminological ambiguity, unclear added-value of 3D geoinformation in
   some instances, and absence of technical information. To address this
   challenge, we delineate a hierarchical terminology (spatial operations,
   use cases, applications), and develop a theoretical reasoning to segment
   and categorise the diverse uses of 3D city models. Following this
   framework, we provide a list of identified use cases of 3D city models
   (with a description of each), and their applications. Our study
   demonstrates that 3D city models are employed in at least 29 use cases
   that are a part of more than 100 applications. The classified inventory
   could be useful for scientists as well as stakeholders in the geospatial
   industry, such as companies and national mapping agencies, as it may
   serve as a reference document to better position their operations,
   design product portfolios, and to better understand the market.}},

Abstract = {{The Caryophyllales constitute a major lineage of flowering plants with
   approximately 12500 species in 39 families. A taxonomic backbone at the
   genus level is provided that reflects the current state of knowledge and
   accepts 749 genera for the order. A detailed review of the literature of
   the past two decades shows that enormous progress has been made in
   understanding overall phylogenetic relationships in Caryophyllales. The
   process of re-circumscribing families in order to be monophyletic
   appears to be largely complete and has led to the recognition of eight
   new families (Anacampserotaceae, Kewaceae, Limeaceae, Lophiocarpaceae,
   Macarthuriaceae, Microteaceae, Montiaceae and Talinaceae), while the
   phylogenetic evaluation of generic concepts is still well underway. As a
   result of this, the number of genera has increased by more than ten
   percent in comparison to the last complete treatments in the ``Families
   and genera of vascular plants{''} series. A checklist with all currently
   accepted genus names in Caryophyllales, as well as nomenclatural
   references, type names and synonymy is presented. Notes indicate how
   extensively the respective genera have been studied in a phylogenetic
   context. The most diverse families at the generic level are Cactaceae
   and Aizoaceae, but 28 families comprise only one to six genera. This
   synopsis represents a first step towards the aim of creating a global
   synthesis of the species diversity in the angiosperm order
   Caryophyllales integrating the work of numerous specialists around the
   world.}},

Abstract = {{Most European vineyard soils exhibit low soil fertility. They are highly
   vulnerable to erosion, low in soil organic matter content and,
   therefore, in water holding capacity and nitrate retention. The
   applications of biochar and biochar-compost are said to address some of
   these issues. We tested the ability of these amendments to improve soil
   quality and plant production quality in a 30-year-old vineyard in
   Valais, Switzerland. The amendments of biochar alone (8 t ha(-1),
   produced from wood at 500 degrees C), aerobic compost (55 t ha(-1)) and
   biochar-compost (8 t ha(-1) + 55 t ha(-1), mixed before the composting
   process) were compared to an un-amended control soil. During the years
   2011, 2012 and 2013 various vine and green cover growth, vine health and
   grape quality parameters were monitored. Biochar and biochar-compost
   treatments induced only small, economically irrelevant and mostly
   non-significant effects over the three years. We concluded that topsoil
   application of higher amounts of biochar has no immediate economic value
   for vine growing in poor fertility, alkaline, temperate soil. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Alpine plant radiations are compared across the world's major mountain
   ranges and shown to be overwhelmingly young and fast, largely confined
   to the Pliocene and Pleistocene, and some of them apparently in the
   early explosive phase of radiation. Accelerated diversification
   triggered by island-like ecological opportunities following the final
   phases of mountain uplift, and in many cases enabled by the key
   adaptation of perennial habit, provides a general model for alpine plant
   radiations. Accelerated growth form evolution facilitated by
   perenniality provides compelling evidence of ecological release and
   suggests striking parallels between island-like alpine, and especially
   tropicalpine radiations, and island radiations more generally. These
   parallels suggest that the world's mountains offer an excellent
   comparative system for explaining evolutionary radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Soil biota provide a number of key ecological services to natural and
   agricultural ecosystems. Increasingly, inoculation of soils with
   beneficial soil biota is being considered as a tool to enhance plant
   productivity and sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. However, one
   important bottleneck is the establishment of viable microbial
   populations that can persist over multiple seasons. Here, we explore the
   factors responsible for establishment of the beneficial soil fungi,
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which can enhance the yield of a
   wide range of agricultural crops. We evaluate field application
   potential and discuss ecological and evolutionary factors responsible
   for application success. We identify three factors that determine
   inoculation success and AM fungal persistence in soils: species
   compatibility (can the introduced species thrive under the imposed
   circumstances?); field carrying capacity (the habitat niche available to
   AMF); and priority effects (the influence of timing and competition on
   the establishment of alternative stable communities). We explore how
   these factors can be employed for establishment and persistence of AMF.
   We address the importance of inoculum choice, plant choice, management
   practices and timing of inoculation for the successful manipulation of
   the resulting AMF community.}},

Abstract = {{Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a radiation flux emitted
   from chlorophyll molecules and is considered an indicator of the actual
   functional stata of plant photosynthesis. The remote measurement of SIF
   opens a new perspective to assess actual photosynthesis at larger,
   ecologically relevant scales and provides an alternative approach to
   study the terrestrial carbon cycle. Recent studies demonstrated the
   reliability of measured SIF signals and showed significant relationships
   between SIF and gross primary production (GPP) at ecosystem and global
   scales. Despite these encouraging results, understanding the complex
   mechanisms between SIF and GPP remains challenging before SIF can be
   finally utilized to constrain estimates of GPP. In this study, we
   present a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between far-red
   SIF retrieved at 760 nm (SIF760) and GPP, and its transferability across
   three structurally and physiologically contrasting ecosystems: perennial
   grassland, cropland and mixed temperate forest. We use multi-temporal
   imaging spectroscopy (IS) data acquired with the Airborne Prism
   EXperiment (APEX) sensor as well as eddy covariance (EC) flux tower data
   to evaluate the relationship between SIF760 and GPP(Ec). We use
   simulations performed with the coupled photosynthesis-fluorescence model
   SCOPE to prove trends obtained from our observational data and to assess
   apparent confounding factors such as physiological and structural
   interferences or temporal scaling effects. Observed relationships
   between SIF760 and GPPEc were asymptotic and ecosystem-specific, i.e.,
   perennial grassland (R-2 = 0.59, rRMSE = 27.1\%), cropland (R-2 = 0.88,
   rRMSE = 3.5\%) and mixed temperate forest (R-2 = 0.48, rRMSE = 15.88\%).
   We demonstrate that asymptotic leaf level relationships between SIF760
   and GPPEc became more linear at canopy level and scaled with temporal
   aggregation. We conclude that remote sensing of SIF provides a new
   observational approach to decrease uncertainties in estimating GPP
   across ecosystems but requires dedicated strategies to compensate for
   the various confounding factors impacting SIF-GPP relationships. Our
   findings help in bridging the gap between mechanistic understanding at
   leaf level and ecosystem-specific observations of the relationships
   between SIF and GPP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Glaciers and their changes through time are increasingly obtained from a
   wide range of satellite sensors. Due to the often remote location of
   glaciers in inaccessible and high-mountain terrain, satellite
   observations frequently provide the only available measurements.
   Furthermore, satellite data provide observations of glacier
   characteristics that are difficult to monitor using ground-based
   measurements, thus complementing the latter. In the Glaciers\_cci
   project of the European Space Agency (ESA), three of these
   characteristics are investigated in detail: glacier area, elevation
   change and surface velocity. We use (a) data from optical sensors to
   derive glacier outlines, (b) digital elevation models from at least two
   points in time, (c) repeat altimetry for determining elevation changes,
   and (d) data from repeat optical and microwave sensors for calculating
   surface velocity. For the latter, the two sensor types provide
   complementary information in terms of spatio-temporal coverage. While
   (c) and (d) can be generated mostly automatically, (a) and (b) require
   the intervention of an analyst. Largely based on the results of various
   round robin experiments (multi-analyst benchmark studies) for each of
   the products, we suggest and describe the most suitable algorithms for
   product creation and provide recommendations concerning their practical
   implementation and the required post-processing. For some of the
   products (area, velocity) post-processing can influence product quality
   more than the main-processing algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Land Surface Phenology (LSP) is the most direct representation of
   intra-annual dynamics of vegetated land surfaces as observed from
   satellite imagery. LSP plays a key role in characterizing land-surface
   fluxes, and is central to accurately parameterizing terrestrial
   biosphere-atmosphere interactions, as well as climate models. In this
   article, we present an evaluation of Pan-European LSP and its changes
   over the past 30years, using the longest continuous record of Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) available to date in combination with
   a landscape-based aggregation scheme. We used indicators of
   Start-Of-Season, End-Of-Season and Growing Season Length (SOS, EOS and
   GSL, respectively) for the period 1982-2011 to test for temporal trends
   in activity of terrestrial vegetation and their spatial distribution. We
   aggregated pixels into ecologically representative spatial units using
   the European Landscape Classification (LANMAP) and assessed the relative
   contribution of spring and autumn phenology. GSL increased significantly
   by 18-24daysdecade(-1) over 18-30\% of the land area of Europe,
   depending on methodology. This trend varied extensively within and
   between climatic zones and landscape classes. The areas of greatest
   growing-season lengthening were the Continental and Boreal zones, with
   hotspots concentrated in southern Fennoscandia, Western Russia and
   pockets of continental Europe. For the Atlantic and Steppic zones, we
   found an average shortening of the growing season with hotspots in
   Western France, the Po valley, and around the Caspian Sea. In many
   zones, changes in the NDVI-derived end-of-season contributed more to the
   GSL trend than changes in spring green-up, resulting in asymmetric
   trends. This underlines the importance of investigating senescence and
   its underlying processes more closely as a driver of LSP and global
   change.}},

Title = {{Life-history constraints in grassland plant species: a growth-defence

Journal = {{ECOLOGY LETTERS}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{513-521}},

Abstract = {{Plant growth can be limited by resource acquisition and defence against
   consumers, leading to contrasting trade-off possibilities. The
   competition-defence hypothesis posits a trade-off between competitive
   ability and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The
   growth-defence hypothesis suggests that strong competitors for nutrients
   are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested
   these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500
   species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing
   treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance
   in species responses to both treatments provided support for a
   growth-defence trade-off: populations that increased with the removal of
   nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal
   of consumers. This result held globally across 4years within plant
   life-history groups and within the majority of individual sites. Thus, a
   growth-defence trade-off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms
   maintaining grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.}},

Journal = {{NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{390+}},

Abstract = {{Approximately half of Greenland's current annual mass loss is attributed
   to runoff from surface melt(1). At higher elevations, however, melt does
   not necessarily equal runoff, because meltwater can refreeze in the
   porous near-surface snow and firn2. Two recent studies suggest that
   all(3) or most(3,4) of Greenland's firn pore space is available for
   meltwater storage, making the firn an important buffer against
   contribution to sea level rise for decades to come(3). Here, we employ
   in situ observations and historical legacy data to demonstrate that
   surface runoff begins to dominate over meltwater storage well before
   firn pore space has been completely filled. Our observations frame the
   recent exceptional melt summers in 2010 and 2012 (refs 5,6), revealing
   significant changes in firn structure at different elevations caused by
   successive intensive melt events. In the upper regions (more than
   similar to 1,900m above sea level), firn has undergone substantial
   densification, while at lower elevations, where melt is most abundant,
   porous firn has lost most of its capability to retain meltwater. Here,
   the formation of near-surface ice layers renders deep pore space
   difficult to access, forcing meltwater to enter an efficient(7) surface
   discharge system and intensifying ice sheet mass loss earlier than
   previously suggested(3).}},

Abstract = {{Forecasts of ecological dynamics in changing environments are
   increasingly important, and are available for a plethora of variables,
   such as species abundance and distribution, community structure and
   ecosystem processes. There is, however, a general absence of knowledge
   about how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature,
   phylogenetic distance), useful ecological forecasts can be made, and
   about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances. The
   ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful
   forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of
   various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty,
   environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level
   of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), and
   organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on
   temporal, spatial and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from
   these case studies demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a
   flexible and powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological
   predictability. It also has potential for motivating and guiding agenda
   setting for ecological forecasting research and development.}},

Title = {{A comparative analysis reveals weak relationships between ecological

Abstract = {{The hypotheses that beta diversity should increase with decreasing
   latitude and increase with spatial extent of a region have rarely been
   tested based on a comparative analysis of multiple datasets, and no such
   study has focused on stream insects. We first assessed how well
   variability in beta diversity of stream insect metacommunities is
   predicted by insect group, latitude, spatial extent, altitudinal range,
   and dataset properties across multiple drainage basins throughout the
   world. Second, we assessed the relative roles of environmental and
   spatial factors in driving variation in assemblage composition within
   each drainage basin. Our analyses were based on a dataset of 95 stream
   insect metacommunities from 31 drainage basins distributed around the
   world. We used dissimilarity-based indices to quantify beta diversity
   for each metacommunity and, subsequently, regressed beta diversity on
   insect group, latitude, spatial extent, altitudinal range, and dataset
   properties (e.g., number of sites and percentage of presences). Within
   each metacommunity, we used a combination of spatial eigenfunction
   analyses and partial redundancy analysis to partition variation in
   assemblage structure into environmental, shared, spatial, and
   unexplained fractions. We found that dataset properties were more
   important predictors of beta diversity than ecological and geographical
   factors across multiple drainage basins. In the within-basin analyses,
   environmental and spatial variables were generally poor predictors of
   variation in assemblage composition. Our results revealed deviation from
   general biodiversity patterns because beta diversity did not show the
   expected decreasing trend with latitude. Our results also call for
   reconsideration of just how predictable stream assemblages are along
   ecological gradients, with implications for environmental assessment and
   conservation decisions. Our findings may also be applicable to other
   dynamic systems where predictability is low.}},

Abstract = {{Big data has now become a strong focus of global interest that is
   increasingly attracting the attention of academia, industry, government
   and other organizations. Big data can be situated in the disciplinary
   area of traditional geospatial data handling theory and methods. The
   increasing volume and varying format of collected geospatial big data
   presents challenges in storing, managing, processing, analyzing,
   visualizing and verifying the quality of data. This has implications for
   the quality of decisions made with big data. Consequently, this position
   paper of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing
   (ISPRS) Technical Commission II (TC II) revisits the existing geospatial
   data handling methods and theories to determine if they are still
   capable of handling emerging geospatial big data. Further, the paper
   synthesises problems, major issues and challenges with current
   developments as well as recommending what needs to be developed further

   There has been recent interest in its possible role in the etiology of

   {[}SAPALDIA], aged between 29 and 73 years. We used estimates of average
   individual home outdoor PM10 {[}particulate matter <10 mu m in diameter]
   and NO2 {[}nitrogen dioxide] exposure over the 10 years preceding the
   survey. Their association with diabetes was modeled using mixed logistic
   regression models, including participants' study area as random effect,
   with incremental adjustment for confounders.
   There were 315 cases of diabetes (prevalence: 5.5\% {[}95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 2.8, 7.2\%]). Both PM10 and NO2 were associated with
   prevalent diabetes with respective odds ratios of 1.40 {[}95\% CI: 1.17,
   1.67] and 1.19 {[}95\% CI: 1.03, 1.38] per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in the
   average home outdoor level. Associations with PM10 were generally
   stronger than with NO2, even in the two-pollutant model. There was some
   indication that beta blockers mitigated the effect of PM10. The
   associations remained stable across different sensitivity analyses.
   Our study adds to the evidence that long term air pollution exposure is
   associated with diabetes mellitus. PM10 appears to be a useful marker of
   aspects of air pollution relevant for diabetes. This association can be
   observed at concentrations below air quality guidelines. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Glaciers in the Karakoram show long-term irregular behaviour with
   comparatively frequent and sudden advances. A glacier inventory of the
   upper Shyok valley situated in northeast Karakoram has been generated
   for the year 2002 using Landsat ETM+ and SRTM3 DEM as baseline data for
   the investigations and subsequent change analysis. The upper Shyok
   valley contained 2123 glaciers (larger than 0.02 km(2) in size) with an
   area of 2977.9 +/- 95.3 km(2) in 2002. Out of these, 18 glaciers with an
   area of 1004.1 +/- 32.1 km(2) showed surge-type behaviour. Change
   analysis based on Hexagon KH-9 (years 1973 and 1974) and Landsat TM/ETM+
   (years 1989, 2002 and 2011) images had to be restricted to a subset of
   136 glaciers (covering an area of 1609.7 +/- 51.5 km(2) in 2002) due to
   adverse snow conditions. The area of the investigated glaciers,
   including the 18 surge-type glaciers identified, showed no significant
   changes during all studied periods. However, the analysis provides a
   hint that the overall glacier area slightly decreased until about 1989
   (area 1973: 1613.6 +/- 43.6 km(2); area 1989: 1602.0 +/- 33.6 km(2))
   followed by an increase (area 2002: 1609.7 +/- 51.5; area 2011: 1615.8
   +/- 35.5 km(2)). Although the overall change in area is insignificant,
   advances in glacier tongues since the end of the 1980s are clearly
   visible. Detailed estimations of length changes for individual glaciers
   since the 1970s and for Central Rimo Glacier since the 1930s confirm the
   irregular retreat and advance.}},

Abstract = {{The meltwater released by the glaciers in the Central Tien Shan feeds in
   particular the Tarim River which is the main artery for the oases at the
   northern margin of the Taklamakan desert. The correct assessment of the
   contribution of the glaciers' meltwater to the total runoff is hampered
   by the lack of long-term measurements of glacier mass budgets. Digital
   terrain models (DTMs) for the different regions in the Central Tien Shan
   were generated based on similar to 1975 KH-9 Hexagon imagery and
   compared to the SRTM3 DTM acquired in February 2000. Moreover, glacier
   area changes for the period similar to 1975-2008 have been measured by
   means of multi-temporal optical satellite imagery.
   The geodetic mass budget estimates for a glacierized area of 5000 km(2)
   revealed increasing mass loss east to west and from the inner to the
   outer ranges. Highest mass loss accompanied by the most pronounced
   glacier retreat was found for the Ak-Shirak massif with a region-wide
   mass balance of -0.51 +/- 0.36 m w.e. a(-1) and a rate of area change of
   -0.27 +/- 0.15\% a(-1), whilst moderate mass loss was observed for the
   Inylchek (0.20 +/- 0.44 m w.e. a-1) and Tomur area (0.33 +/- 0.30 m w.e.
   a(-1)) despite partly debris cover. These latter regions also revealed
   the lowest glacier shrinkage within the entire Central Tien Shan. The
   total glacier mass loss of 035 034 m w.e. a(-1) is, however, within the
   global average whilst the glacier area shrinkage is comparatively low.
   On average, the investigated glacierized area of similar to 6600 km(2)
   shrank by 0.11 +/- 0.15\% a(-1) only. We could also identify several
   surge-type glaciers. The results are consistent with in-situ mass
   balance measurements for Karabatkak Glacier and previously published
   results of the Ak-Shirak range proving the suitability of declassified
   imagery for glacier change investigations. The contribution to the
   runoff of Aksu River, the largest tributary of the Tarim River, due to
   glacier imbalance has been determined at similar to 20\% for the
   1975-2000 period. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We present the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX), its calibration and
   subsequent radiometric measurements as well as Earth science
   applications derived from this data. APEX is a dispersive pushbroom
   imaging spectrometer covering the solar reflected wavelength range
   between 372 and 2540 nm with nominal 312 (max. 532) spectral bands. APEX
   is calibrated using a combination of laboratory, in-flight and vicarious
   calibration approaches. These are complemented by using a forward and
   inverse radiative transfer modeling approach, suitable to further
   validate APEX data. We establish traceability of APEX radiances to a
   primary calibration standard, including uncertainty analysis. We also
   discuss the instrument simulation process ranging from initial
   specifications to performance validation. In a second part, we present
   Earth science applications using APEX. They include geometric and
   atmospheric compensated as well as reflectance anisotropy minimized
   Level 2 data. Further, we discuss retrieval of aerosol optical depth as
   well as vertical column density of NOx, a radiance data-based coupled
   canopy atmosphere model, and finally measuring sun-induced chlorophyll
   fluorescence (Fs) and infer plant pigment content. The results report on
   all APEX specifications including validation. APEX radiances are
   traceable to a primary standard with <4\% uncertainty and with an
   average SNR of >625 for all spectral bands. Radiance based vicarious
   calibration is traceable to a secondary standard with <= 65\%
   uncertainty. Except for inferring plant pigment content, all
   applications are validated using in-situ measurement approaches and
   modeling. Even relatively broad APEX bands (FWHM of 6 nm at 760 nm) can
   assess Fs with modeling agreements as high as R-2 = 0.87 (relative RMSE
   = 27.76\%). We conclude on the use of high resolution imaging
   spectrometers and suggest further development of imaging spectrometers
   supporting science grade spectroscopy measurements. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Biodiversity experiments generally report a positive effect of plant
   biodiversity on aboveground biomass (overyielding), which typically
   increases with time. Various studies also found overyielding for
   belowground plant biomass, but this has never been measured over time.
   Also, potential underlying mechanisms have remained unclear.
   Differentiation in rooting patterns among plant species and plant
   functional groups has been proposed as a main driver of the observed
   biodiversity effect on belowground biomass, leading to more efficient
   belowground resource use with increasing diversity, but so far there is
   little evidence to support this. We analyzed standing root biomass and
   its distribution over the soil profile, along a 1-16 species richness
   gradient over eight years in the Jena Experiment in Germany, and
   compared belowground to aboveground overyielding. In our long-term
   dataset, total root biomass increased with increasing species richness
   but this effect was only apparent after four years. The increasingly
   positive relationship between species richness and root biomass,
   explaining 12\% of overall variation and up to 28\% in the last year of
   our study, was mainly due to decreasing root biomass at low diversity
   over time. Functional group composition strongly affected total standing
   root biomass, explaining 44\% of variation, with grasses and legumes
   having strong overall positive and negative effects, respectively.
   Functional group richness or interactions between functional group
   presences did not strongly contribute to overyielding. We found no
   support for the hypothesis that vertical root differentiation increases
   with species richness, with functional group richness or composition.
   Other explanations, such as stronger negative plant-soil feedbacks in
   low-diverse plant communities on standing root biomass and vertical
   distribution should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce future loss of biodiversity and to allocate conservation funds
   effectively, the major drivers behind large-scale extinction processes
   must be identified. A promising approach is to link the red-list status
   of species and specific traits that connect species of functionally
   important taxa or guilds to resources they rely on. Such traits can be
   used to detect the influence of anthropogenic ecosystem changes and
   conservation efforts on species, which allows for practical
   recommendations for conservation. We modeled the German Red List
   categories as an ordinal index of extinction risk of 1025 saproxylic
   beetles with a proportional-odds linear mixed-effects model for ordered
   categorical responses. In this model, we estimated fixed effects for
   intrinsic traits characterizing species biology, required resources, and
   distribution with phylogenetically correlated random intercepts. The
   model also allowed predictions of extinction risk for species with no
   red-list category. Our model revealed a higher extinction risk for
   lowland and large species as well as for species that rely on wood of
   large diameter, broad-leaved trees, or open canopy. These results mirror
   well the ecological degradation of European forests over the last
   centuries caused by modern forestry, that is the conversion of natural
   broad-leaved forests to dense conifer-dominated forests and the loss of
   old growth and dead wood. Therefore, conservation activities aimed at
   saproxylic beetles in all types of forests in Central and Western Europe
   should focus on lowlands, and habitat management of forest stands should
   aim at increasing the amount of dead wood of large diameter, dead wood
   of broad-leaved trees, and dead wood in sunny areas.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity continues to decline in the face of increasing
   anthropogenic pressures such as habitat destruction, exploitation,
   pollution and introduction of alien species. Existing global databases
   of species' threat status or population time series are dominated by
   charismatic species. The collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and
   biogeographic extents, and that support computation of a range of
   biodiversity indicators, is necessary to enable better understanding of
   historical declines and to project - and avert - future declines. We
   describe and assess a new database of more than 1.6 million samples from
   78 countries representing over 28,000 species, collated from existing
   spatial comparisons of local-scale biodiversity exposed to different
   intensities and types of anthropogenic pressures, from terrestrial sites
   around the world. The database contains measurements taken in 208 (of
   814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity hotspots and
   16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database contains more than 1\% of
   the total number of all species described, and more than 1\% of the
   described species within many taxonomic groups - including flowering
   plants, gymnosperms, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles,
   lepidopterans and hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added
   to, is therefore already considerably larger and more representative
   than those used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity trends
   and responses. The database is being assembled as part of the PREDICTS
   project (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing
   Terrestrial Systems - ). We make site-level summary data available
   alongside this article. The full database will be publicly available in
   2015.}},

Abstract = {{A major question in ecology is how age-specific variation in demographic
   parameters influences population dynamics. Based on long-term studies of
   growing populations of birds and mammals, we analyze population dynamics
   by using fluctuations in the total reproductive value of the population.
   This enables us to account for random fluctuations in age distribution.
   The influence of demographic and environmental stochasticity on the
   population dynamics of a species decreased with generation time.
   Variation in age-specific contributions to total reproductive value and
   to stochastic components of population dynamics was correlated with the
   position of the species along the slow-fast continuum of life-history
   variation. Younger age classes relative to the generation time accounted
   for larger contributions to the total reproductive value and to
   demographic stochasticity in slow than in fast species, in which many
   age classes contributed more equally. In contrast, fluctuations in
   population growth rate attributable to stochastic environmental
   variation involved a larger proportion of all age classes independent of
   life history. Thus, changes in population growth rates can be
   surprisingly well explained by basic species-specific life-history
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The substrate partitioning of sympatric populations of freshwater
   bacterioplankton was studied via microautoradiography and fluorescence
   in situ hybridization. Fourteen radiolabeled tracers were used to assess
   microbial acquisition spectra of low-molecular-weight (LMW) organic
   compounds. The most abundant group, ac1 Actinobacteria, were highly
   active in leucine, thymidine and glucose assimilation, whereas
   Alphaproteobacteria from the LD12 lineage (the freshwater sister clade
   of SAR11) only weakly incorporated these tracers, but exhibited a
   distinct preference for glutamine and glutamate. Different Bacteroidetes
   showed contrasting uptake patterns: Flavobacteriales did not incorporate
   significant amounts of any LMW compound, and Cyclobacteriaceae were
   clearly specialized on leucine, glucose and arginine. Betaproteobacteria
   represented the most active and versatile bacterioplankton fraction and
   >90\% of them could be assigned to eight species-to genus-like
   populations with contrasting substrate specialization. Limnohabitans sp.
   were the most abundant and active Betaproteobacteria, incorporating
   almost all tracers. While three closely related betaproteobacterial
   populations substantially differed in their uptake spectra, two more
   distantly related lineages had very similar preferences, and one
   population did not incorporate any tracer. The dominant phototrophic
   microorganism, the filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens,
   assimilated several substrates, whereas other (pico)cyanobacteria had no
   heterotrophic activity. The variable extent of specialization by the
   studied bacterial taxa on subsets of LMW compounds contrasts theoretical
   considerations about non-selective microbial substrate assimilation at
   oligotrophic conditions. This physiological niche separation might be
   one explanation for the coexistence of freshwater bacterioplankton
   species in a seemingly uniform environment. The ISME Journal (2013) 7,

Abstract = {{We investigate combined continuum removal and radiative transfer (RT)
   modeling to retrieve leaf chlorophyll a \& b content (C-ab) from the
   AISA Eagle airborne imaging spectrometer data of sub-meter (0.4 m)
   spatial resolution. Based on coupled PROSPECT-DART RT simulations of a
   Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand, we propose a new C-ab
   sensitive index located between 650 and 720 nm and termed ANCB(650-720).
   The performance of ANCB(650-720) was validated against ground-measured
   C-ab of ten spruce crowns and compared with C-ab estimated by a
   conventional artificial neural network (ANN) trained with continuum
   removed RT simulations and also by three previously published
   chlorophyll optical indices: normalized difference between reflectance
   at 925 and 710 nm (ND925\&710), simple reflectance ratio between 750 and
   710 nm (SR750/710) and the ratio of TCARI/OSAVI indices. Although all
   retrieval methods produced visually comparable C-ab spatial patterns,
   the ground validation revealed that the ANCB(650-720) and ANN retrievals
   are more accurate than the other three chlorophyll indices (R-2=0.72 for
   both methods). ANCB(650-720) estimated C-ab with an RMSE=2.27 mu g
   cm(-2) (relative RRMSE=4.35\%) and ANN with an RMSE= 2.18 mu g cm(-2)
   (RRMSE=4.18\%), while SR750/710 with an RMSE=4.16 mu g cm(-2)
   (RRMSE=7.97\%), ND925\&710 with an RMSE= 9.07 mu g cm(-2)
   (RRMSE=17.38\%) and TCARI/OSAVI with an RMSE=12.30 mu g cm(-2)
   (RRMSE=23.56\%). Also the systematic RMSEs was lower than the
   unsystematic one only for the ANCB(650-720) and ANN retrievals. Our
   results indicate that the newly proposed index can provide the same
   accuracy as ANN except for C-ab values below 30 mu g cm(-2), which are
   slightly overestimated (RMSE=2.42 mu g cm(-2)). The computationally
   efficient ANCB(650-720) retrieval provides accurate high spatial
   resolution airborne C-ab maps, considerable as a suitable reference data
   for validating satellite-based C-ab products. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

   analysis}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Biochar may contribute to climate change mitigation at negative cost by
   sequestering photosynthetically fixed carbon in soil while increasing
   crop yields. The magnitude of biochar's potential in this regard will
   depend on crop yield benefits, which have not been well-characterized
   across different soils and biochars. Using data from 84 studies, we
   employ meta-analytical, missing data, and semiparametric statistical
   methods to explain heterogeneity in crop yield responses across
   different soils, biochars, and agricultural management factors, and then
   estimate potential changes in yield across different soil environments
   globally. We find that soil cation exchange capacity and organic carbon
   were strong predictors of yield response, with low cation exchange and
   low carbon associated with positive response. We also find that yield
   response increases over time since initial application, compared to
   non-biochar controls. High reported soil clay content and low soil pH
   were weaker predictors of higher yield response. No biochar parameters
   in our dataset-biochar pH, percentage carbon content, or temperature of
   pyrolysis-were significant predictors of yield impacts. Projecting our
   fitted model onto a global soil database, we find the largest potential
   increases in areas with highly weathered soils, such as those
   characterizing much of the humid tropics. Richer soils characterizing
   much of the world's important agricultural areas appear to be less
   likely to benefit from biochar.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of arthropod-borne viruses threaten both human and animal
   health either through their presence in Europe or through risk of
   introduction. Prominent among these is West Nile virus (WNV), primarily
   an avian virus, which has caused multiple outbreaks associated with
   human and equine mortality. Endemic outbreaks of West Nile fever have
   been reported in Italy, Greece, France, Romania, Hungary, Russia and
   Spain, with further spread expected. Most outbreaks in Western Europe
   have been due to infection with WNV Lineage 1. In Eastern Europe WNV
   Lineage 2 has been responsible for human and bird mortality,
   particularly in Greece, which has experienced extensive outbreaks over
   three consecutive years. Italy has experienced co-circulation with both
   virus lineages. The ability to manage this threat in a cost-effective
   way is dependent on early detection. Targeted surveillance for pathogens
   within mosquito populations offers the ability to detect viruses prior
   to their emergence in livestock, equine species or human populations. In
   addition, it can establish a baseline of mosquito-borne virus activity
   and allow monitoring of change to this over time. Early detection offers
   the opportunity to raise disease awareness, initiate vector control and
   preventative vaccination, now available for horses, and encourage
   personal protection against mosquito bites. This would have major
   benefits through financial savings and reduction in equid
   morbidity/mortality. However, effective surveillance that predicts virus
   outbreaks is challenged by a range of factors including limited
   resources, variation in mosquito capture rates (too few or too many),
   difficulties in mosquito identification, often reliant on specialist
   entomologists, and the sensitive, rapid detection of viruses in mosquito
   pools. Surveillance for WNV and other arboviruses within mosquito
   populations varies between European countries in the extent and focus of
   the surveillance. This study reviews the current status of WNV in
   mosquito populations across Europe and how this is informing our
   understanding of virus epidemiology. Key findings such as detection of
   virus, presence of vector species and invasive mosquito species are
   summarized, and some of the difficulties encountered when applying a
   cost-effective surveillance programme are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Projections of discharge are key for future water resources management.
   These projections are subject to uncertainties, which are difficult to
   handle in the decision process on adaptation strategies. Uncertainties
   arise from different sources such as the emission scenarios, the climate
   models and their postprocessing, the hydrological models, and the
   natural variability. Here we present a detailed and quantitative
   uncertainty assessment, based on recent climate scenarios for
   Switzerland (CH2011 data set) and covering catchments representative for
   midlatitude alpine areas. This study relies on a particularly wide range
   of discharge projections resulting from the factorial combination of 3
   emission scenarios, 10-20 regional climate models, 2 postprocessing
   methods, and 3 hydrological models of different complexity. This enabled
   us to decompose the uncertainty in the ensemble of projections using
   analyses of variance (ANOVA). We applied the same modeling setup to six
   catchments to assess the influence of catchment characteristics on the
   projected streamflow, and focused on changes in the annual discharge
   cycle. The uncertainties captured by our setup originate mainly from the
   climate models and natural climate variability, but the choice of
   emission scenario plays a large role by the end of the 21st century. The
   contribution of the hydrological models to the projection uncertainty
   varied strongly with catchment elevation. The discharge changes were
   compared to the estimated natural decadal variability, which revealed
   that a climate change signal emerges even under the lowest emission
   scenario (RCP2.6) by the end of the century. Limiting emissions to
   RCP2.6 levels would nevertheless reduce the largest regime changes by
   the end of the century by approximately a factor of two, in comparison
   to impacts projected for the high emission scenario SRES A2. We finally
   show that robust regime changes emerge despite the projection
   uncertainty. These changes are significant and are consistent across a
   wide range of scenarios and catchments. We propose their identification
   as a way to aid decision making under uncertainty.}},

Title = {{Risk avoidance in sympatric large carnivores: reactive or predictive?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1097-1105}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Risks of predation or interference competition are major factors
   shaping the distribution of species. An animal's response to risk can
   either be reactive, to an immediate risk, or predictive, based on
   preceding risk or past experiences. The manner in which animals respond
   to risk is key in understanding avoidance, and hence coexistence,
   between interacting species.
   2. We investigated whether cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), known to be
   affected by predation and competition by lions (Panthera leo) and
   spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta), respond reactively or predictively to
   the risks posed by these larger carnivores.
   3. We used simultaneous spatial data from Global Positioning System
   (GPS) radiocollars deployed on all known social groups of cheetahs,
   lions and spotted hyaenas within a 2700 km(2) study area on the
   periphery of the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. The response to
   risk of encountering lions and spotted hyaenas was explored on three
   levels: short-term or immediate risk, calculated as the distance to the
   nearest (contemporaneous) lion or spotted hyaena, long-term risk,
   calculated as the likelihood of encountering lions and spotted hyaenas
   based on their cumulative distributions over a 6-month period and
   habitat-associated risk, quantified by the habitat used by each of the
   three species.
   4. We showed that space and habitat use by cheetahs was similar to that
   of lions and, to a lesser extent, spotted hyaenas. However, cheetahs
   avoided immediate risks by positioning themselves further from lions and
   spotted hyaenas than predicted by a random distribution.
   5. Our results suggest that cheetah spatial distribution is a
   hierarchical process, first driven by resource acquisition and
   thereafter fine-tuned by predator avoidance; thus suggesting a reactive,
   rather than a predictive, response to risk.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic labeling (or pixel-level land-cover classification) in
   ultrahigh-resolution imagery (<10 cm) requires statistical models able
   to learn high-level concepts from spatial data, with large appearance
   variations. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve this goal by
   learning discriminatively a hierarchy of representations of increasing
   abstraction. In this paper, we present a CNN-based system relying on a
   downsample-then-upsample architecture. Specifically, it first learns a
   rough spatial map of high-level representations by means of convolutions
   and then learns to upsample them back to the original resolution by
   deconvolutions. By doing so, the CNN learns to densely label every pixel
   at the original resolution of the image. This results in many
   advantages, including: 1) the state-of-the-art numerical accuracy; 2)
   the improved geometric accuracy of predictions; and 3) high efficiency
   at inference time. We test the proposed system on the Vaihingen and
   Potsdam subdecimeter resolution data sets, involving the semantic
   labeling of aerial images of 9- and 5-cm resolution, respectively. These
   data sets are composed by many large and fully annotated tiles, allowing
   an unbiased evaluation of models making use of spatial information. We
   do so by comparing two standard CNN architectures with the proposed one:
   standard patch classification, prediction of local label patches by
   employing only convolutions, and full patch labeling by employing
   deconvolutions. All the systems compare favorably or outperform a
   state-of-the-art baseline relying on superpixels and powerful appearance
   descriptors. The proposed full patch labeling CNN outperforms these
   models by a large margin, also showing a very appealing inference time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the current knowledge on climate change impacts on
   mass movement activity in mountain environments by illustrating
   characteristic cases of debris flows, rock slope failures and landslides
   from the French, Italian, and Swiss Alps. It is expected that events are
   likely to occur less frequently during summer, whereas the anticipated
   increase of rainfall in spring and fall could likely alter debris-flow
   activity during the shoulder seasons (March, April, November, and
   December). The magnitude of debris flows could become larger due to
   larger amounts of sediment delivered to the channels and as a result of
   the predicted increase in heavy precipitation events. At the same time,
   however, debris-flow volumes in high-mountain areas will depend chiefly
   on the stability and/or movement rates of permafrost bodies, and
   destabilized rock glaciers could lead to debris flows without historic
   precedents in the future. The frequency of rock slope failures is likely
   to increase, as excessively warm air temperatures, glacier shrinkage, as
   well as permafrost warming and thawing will affect and reduce rock slope
   stability in the direction that adversely affects rock slope stability.
   Changes in landslide activity in the French and Western Italian Alps
   will likely depend on differences in elevation. Above 1500 m asl, the
   projected decrease in snow season duration in future winters and springs
   will likely affect the frequency, number and seasonality of landslide
   reactivations. In Piemonte, for instance, 21st century landslides have
   been demonstrated to occur more frequently in early spring and to be
   triggered by moderate rainfalls, but also to occur in smaller numbers.
   On the contrary, and in line with recent observations, events in autumn,
   characterized by a large spatial density of landslide occurrences might
   become more scarce in the Piemonte region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Variations in photosynthesis still cause substantial uncertainties in
   predicting photosynthetic CO2 uptake rates and monitoring plant stress.
   Changes in actual photosynthesis that are not related to greenness of
   vegetation are difficult to measure by reflectance based optical remote
   sensing techniques. Several activities are underway to evaluate the
   sun-induced fluorescence signal on the ground and on a coarse spatial
   scale using space-borne imaging spectrometers. Intermediate-scale
   observations using airborne-based imaging spectroscopy, which are
   critical to bridge the existing gap between small-scale field studies
   and global observations, are still insufficient. Here we present the
   first validated maps of sun-induced fluorescence in that critical,
   intermediate spatial resolution, employing the novel airborne imaging
   spectrometer HyPlant. HyPlant has an unprecedented spectral resolution,
   which allows for the first time quantifying sun-induced fluorescence
   fluxes in physical units according to the Fraunhofer Line Depth
   Principle that exploits solar and atmospheric absorption bands. Maps of
   sun-induced fluorescence show a large spatial variability between
   different vegetation types, which complement classical remote sensing
   approaches. Different crop types largely differ in emitting fluorescence
   that additionally changes within the seasonal cycle and thus may be
   related to the seasonal activation and deactivation of the
   photosynthetic machinery. We argue that sun-induced fluorescence
   emission is related to two processes: (i) the total absorbed radiation
   by photosynthetically active chlorophyll; and (ii) the functional status
   of actual photosynthesis and vegetation stress.}},

Title = {{Insight into the evolution of the Solanaceae from the parental genomes
   of Petunia hybrida}},
Journal = {{NATURE PLANTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Petunia hybrida is a popular bedding plant that has a long history as a
   genetic model system. We report the whole-genome sequencing and assembly
   of inbred derivatives of its two wild parents, P. axillaris N and P.
   inflata S6. The assemblies include 91.3\% and 90.2\% coverage of their
   diploid genomes (1.4 Gb; 2n = 14) containing 32,928 and 36,697
   protein-coding genes, respectively. The genomes reveal that the Petunia
   lineage has experienced at least two rounds of hexaploidization: the
   older gamma event, which is shared with most Eudicots, and a more recent
   Solanaceae event that is shared with tomato and other solanaceous
   species. Transcription factors involved in the shift from bee to moth
   pollination reside in particularly dynamic regions of the genome, which
   may have been key to the remarkable diversity of floral colour patterns
   and pollination systems. The high-quality genome sequences will enhance
   the value of Petunia as a model system for research on unique biological
   phenomena such as small RNAs, symbiosis, self-incompatibility and
   circadian rhythms.}},

Title = {{SWEET17, a Facilitative Transporter, Mediates Fructose Transport across

Abstract = {{Fructose (Fru) is a major storage form of sugars found in vacuoles, yet
   the molecular regulation of vacuolar Fru transport is poorly studied.
   Although SWEET17 (for SUGARS WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXPORTED TRANSPORTERS17)
   has been characterized as a vacuolar Fru exporter in leaves, its
   expression in leaves is low. Here, RNA analysis and
   SWEET17-beta-glucuronidase/-GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN fusions expressed
   in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) reveal that SWEET17 is highly
   expressed in the cortex of roots and localizes to the tonoplast of root
   cells. Expression of SWEET17 in roots was inducible by Fru and darkness,
   treatments that activate accumulation and release of vacuolar Fru,
   respectively. Mutation and ectopic expression of SWEET17 led to
   increased and decreased root growth in the presence of Fru,
   respectively. Overexpression of SWEET17 specifically reduced the Fru
   content in leaves by 80\% during cold stress. These results intimate
   that SWEET17 functions as a Fru-specific uniporter on the root
   tonoplast. Vacuoles overexpressing SWEET17 showed increased {[}C-14] Fru
   uptake compared with the wild type. SWEET17-mediated Fru uptake was
   insensitive to ATP or treatment with NH4Cl or carbonyl cyanide
   m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, indicating that SWEET17 functions as an
   energy-independent facilitative carrier. The Arabidopsis genome contains
   a close paralog of SWEET17 in clade IV, SWEET16. The predominant
   expression of SWEET16 in root vacuoles and reduced root growth of
   mutants under Fru excess indicate that SWEET16 also functions as a
   vacuolar transporter in roots. We propose that in addition to a role in
   leaves, SWEET17 plays a key role in facilitating bidirectional Fru
   transport across the tonoplast of roots in response to metabolic demand
   to maintain cytosolic Fru homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{Human societies, and their well-being, depend to a significant extent on
   the state of the ecosystems that surround them. These ecosystems are
   changing rapidly usually in response to anthropogenic changes in the
   environment. To determine the likely impact of environmental change on
   ecosystems and the best ways to manage them, it would be desirable to be
   able to predict their future states. We present a proposal to develop
   the paradigm of predictive systems ecology, explicitly to understand and
   predict the properties and behaviour of ecological systems. We discuss
   the necessary and desirable features of predictive systems ecology

   would benefit both as a scientific discipline and increase its impact in
   society if it were to embrace the need to become more predictive.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of different feed waters in terms of eukaryotic populations
   and organic carbon content on the biofilm structure formation and
   permeate flux during Gravity-Driven Membrane (GDM) filtration was
   investigated in this study. GDM filtration was performed at ultra-low
   pressure (65 mbar) in dead-end mode without control of the biofilm
   formation. Different feed waters were tested (River water, pre-treated
   river water, lake water, and tap water) and varied with regard to their
   organic substrate content and their predator community. River water was
   manipulated either by chemically inhibiting all eukaryotes or by
   filtering out macrozoobenthos (metazoan organisms). The structure of the
   biofilm was characterized at the meso- and micro-scale using Optical
   Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy
   (CLSM), respectively. Based on Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurements,
   the river waters provided the highest potential for bacterial growth
   whereas tap water had the lowest. An increasing content in soluble and
   particulate organic substrate resulted in increasing biofilm
   accumulation on membrane surface. However, enhanced biofilm accumulation
   did not result in lower flux values and permeate flux was mainly
   influenced by the structure of the biofilm. Metazoan organisms (in
   particular nematodes and oligochaetes) built-up protective habitats,
   which resulted in the formation of open and spatially heterogeneous
   biofilms composed of biomass patches. In the absence of predation by
   metazoan organisms, a flat and compact biofilm developed. It is
   concluded that the activity of metazoan organisms in natural river water
   and its impact on biofilm structure balances the detrimental effect of a
   high biofilm accumulation, thus allowing for a broader application of
   GDM filtration. Finally, our results suggest that for surface waters
   with high particulate organic carbon (POC) content, the use of worms is
   suitable to enhance POC removal before ultrafiltration units. (C) 2013

Title = {{Switching between apparently redundant iron-uptake mechanisms benefits
   bacteria in changeable environments}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{280}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria often possess multiple siderophore-based iron uptake systems
   for scavenging this vital resource from their environment. However, some
   siderophores seem redundant, because they have limited iron-binding
   efficiency and are seldom expressed under iron limitation. Here, we
   investigate the conundrum of why selection does not eliminate this
   apparent redundancy. We focus on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium
   that can produce two siderophores-the highly efficient but metabolically
   expensive pyoverdine, and the inefficient but metabolically cheap
   pyochelin. We found that the bacteria possess molecular mechanisms to
   phenotypically switch from mainly producing pyoverdine under severe iron
   limitation to mainly producing pyochelin when iron is only moderately
   limited. We further show that strains exclusively producing pyochelin
   grew significantly better than strains exclusively producing pyoverdine
   under moderate iron limitation, whereas the inverse was seen under
   severe iron limitation. This suggests that pyochelin is not redundant,
   but that switching between siderophore strategies might be beneficial to
   trade off efficiencies versus costs of siderophores. Indeed, simulations
   parameterized from our data confirmed that strains retaining the
   capacity to switch between siderophores significantly outcompeted
   strains defective for one or the other siderophore under fluctuating
   iron availabilities. Finally, we discuss how siderophore switching can
   be viewed as a form of collective decision-making, whereby a coordinated
   shift in behaviour at the group level emerges as a result of positive
   and negative feedback loops operating among individuals at the local
   scale.}},

   Strains}},

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence indicates that volatile compounds emitted by
   bacteria can influence the growth of other organisms. In this study, the
   volatiles produced by three different strains of Burkholderia ambifaria
   were analysed and their effects on the growth of plants and fungi, as
   well as on the antibiotic resistance of target bacteria, were assessed.
   Burkholderia ambifaria emitted highly bioactive volatiles independently
   of the strain origin (clinical environment, rhizosphere of pea, roots of
   maize). These volatile blends induced significant biomass increase in
   the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana as well as growth inhibition of two
   phytopathogenic fungi (Rhizoctonia solani and Alternaria alternata). In
   Escherichia coli exposed to the volatiles of B. ambifaria, resistance to
   the aminoglycoside antibiotics gentamicin and kanamycin was found to be
   increased. The volatile blends of the three strains were similar, and
   dimethyl disulfide was the most abundant compound. Sulfur compounds,
   ketones, and aromatic compounds were major groups in all three volatile
   profiles. When applied as pure substance, dimethyl disulfide led to
   increased plant biomass, as did acetophenone and 3-hexanone. Significant
   fungal growth reduction was observed with high concentrations of
   dimethyl di- and trisulfide, 4-octanone, S-methyl methanethiosulphonate,
   1-phenylpropan-1-one, and 2-undecanone, while dimethyl trisulfide,
   1-methylthio-3-pentanone, and o-aminoacetophenone increased resistance
   of E. coli to aminoglycosides. Comparison of the volatile profile
   produced by an engineered mutant impaired in quorum-sensing (QS)
   signalling with the corresponding wild-type led to the conclusion that
   QS is not involved in the regulation of volatile production in B.

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Ice volume estimates are crucial for assessing water reserves stored in
   glaciers. Due to its large glacier coverage, such estimates are of
   particular interest for the Himalayan-Karakoram (HK) region. In this
   study, different existing methodologies are used to estimate the ice
   reserves: three area-volume relations, one slope-dependent volume
   estimation method, and two ice-thickness distribution models are applied
   to a recent, detailed, and complete glacier inventory of the HK region,
   spanning over the period 2000-2010 and revealing an ice coverage of 40
   775 km(2). An uncertainty and sensitivity assessment is performed to
   investigate the influence of the observed glacier area and important
   model parameters on the resulting total ice volume. Results of the two
   ice-thickness distribution models are validated with local ice-thickness
   measurements at six glaciers. The resulting ice volumes for the entire
   HK region range from 2955 to 4737 km(3), depending on the approach. This
   range is lower than most previous estimates. Results from the ice
   thickness distribution models and the slope-dependent thickness
   estimations agree well with measured local ice thicknesses. However,
   total volume estimates from area-related relations are larger than those
   from other approaches. The study provides evidence on the significant
   effect of the selected method on results and underlines the importance
   of a careful and critical evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Glacial lake hazards and glacial lake distributions are investigated in
   many glaciated regions of the world, but comparably little attention has
   been given to these topics in the Indian Himalayas. In this study we
   present a first area-wide glacial lake inventory, including a
   qualitative classification at 251 glacial lakes >0.01 km(2). Lakes were
   detected in the five states spanning the Indian Himalayas, and lake
   distribution pattern and lake characteristics were found to differ
   significantly between regions. Three glacial lakes, from different
   geographic and climatic regions within the Indian Himalayas were then
   selected for a detailed risk assessment. Lake outburst probability,
   potential outburst magnitudes and associated damage were evaluated on
   the basis of high-resolution satellite imagery, field assessments and
   through the use of a dynamic model. The glacial lakes analyzed in the
   states of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh were found to present
   moderate risks to downstream villages, whereas the lake in Sikkim
   severely threatens downstream locations. At the study site in Sikkim, a
   dam breach could trigger drainage of ca. 16 x 10(6) m(3) water and
   generate maximum lake discharge of nearly 7000 m(3) s(-). The
   identification of critical glacial lakes in the Indian Himalayas and the
   detailed risk assessments at three specific sites allow prioritizing
   further investigations and help in the definition of risk reduction
   actions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   experiments do not precisely quantify the niche and relative fitness
   differences that govern species coexistence. Given this lack of direct
   correspondence, how can we know whether species-rich mixtures are stable
   and that the benefits of diversity will therefore persist? We develop a
   resource-based included-niche model in which plant species have
   asymmetric access to a nested set of belowground resource pools. We use
   the model to show that positive complementarity effects arise from
   stabilising niche differences, but do not necessarily lead to stable
   coexistence and hence can be transient. In addition, these transient
   complementarity effects occur in the model when there is no
   complementary resource use among species. Including a trade-off between
   uptake rates and the size of the resource pool stabilised interactions
   and led to persistent complementarity coupled with weak or negative
   selection effects, consistent with results from the longest-running
   field biodiversity experiments. We suggest that future progress requires
   a greater mechanistic understanding of the links between ecosystem
   functions and their underlying biological processes.}},

   multiresolution and multisensor fusion between optical data acquired at
   20-cm resolution and long-wave (thermal) infrared hyperspectral data at
   1-m resolution. The Contest was proposed as a double-track competition:
   one aiming at accurate landcover classification and the other seeking
   innovation in the fusion of thermal hyperspectral and color data. In
   this paper, the results obtained by the winners of both tracks are
   presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing offers the potential to study forest ecosystems by
   providing spatially and temporally distributed information on key
   biophysical and biochemical variables. The estimation of biochemical
   constituents of leaves from remotely sensed data is of high interest
   revealing insight on photosynthetic processes, plant health, plant
   functional types, and species composition. However, upscaling leaf level
   observations to canopy level is not a trivial task, in particular due to
   the inherent structural complexity of forests. A common solution for
   scaling spectral information is the use of physically-based radiative
   transfer models. We parameterize the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative
   Transfer (DART) model based on airborne and in situ measurements.
   At-sensor radiances were simulated and compared with measurements of the
   Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer. The study was
   performed on the Laegern site (47 degrees 28'43.0 N, 8 degrees 21'53.2
   E, Switzerland), a temperate mixed forest characterized by steep slopes,
   a heterogeneous spectral background, and a high species diversity.
   Particularly the accurate 3D modeling of the complex canopy architecture
   is crucial to understand the interaction of photons with the vegetation
   canopy and its background. Two turbid medium based forest reconstruction
   approaches were developed and compared; namely based on a voxel grid and
   based on individual tree detection. Our study shows that the voxel grid
   based reconstruction yields better results. When using a pixel-wise
   comparison with the imaging spectrometer data, the voxel grid approach
   performed better (R-2 = 0.48, lambda 780 nm) than the individual tree
   approach (R-2 = 0.34, lambda 780 nm). Spatial patterns as compared to
   APEX data were similar, whereas absolute radiance values differed
   slightly, depending on wavelength. We provide a successful
   representation of a 3D radiative regime of a temperate mixed forest,
   suitable to simulate most spectral and spatial features of imaging
   spectrometer data. Limitations of the approach include the high spectral
   variability of leaf optical properties between and within species, which
   will be further addressed. The results also reveal the need of more
   accurate parameterizations of small-scale structures, such as needle
   clumping at shoot level as well as leaf angle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important members of the plant
   microbiome. They are obligate biotrophs that colonize the roots of most
   land plants and enhance host nutrient acquisition. Many AMF themselves
   harbor endobacteria in their hyphae and spores. Two types of
   endobacteria are known in Glomeromycota: rod-shaped Gram-negative
   Candidatus Glomeribacter gigasporarum, CaGg, limited in distribution to
   members of the Gigasporaceae family, and coccoid Mollicutes-related
   endobacteria, Mre, widely distributed across different lineages of AMF.
   The goal of the present study is to investigate the patterns of
   distribution and coexistence of the two endosymbionts, CaGg and Mre, in
   spore samples of several strains of Gigaspora margarita. Based on
   previous observations, we hypothesized that some AMF could host
   populations of both endobacteria. To test this hypothesis, we performed
   an extensive investigation of both endosymbionts in G. margarita spores
   sampled from Cameroonian soils as well as in the Japanese G. margarita
   MAFF520054 isolate using different approaches (molecular phylotyping,
   electron microscopy, fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative
   real-time PCR). We found that a single AMF host can harbour both types
   of endobacteria, with Mre population being more abundant, variable and
   prone to recombination than the CaGg one. Both endosymbionts seem to
   retain their genetic and lifestyle peculiarities regardless of whether
   they colonize the host alone or together. These findings show for the
   first time that fungi support an intracellular bacterial microbiome, in
   which distinct types of endobacteria coexist in a single cell.}},

Abstract = {{Trait-based approaches are increasingly being used to test mechanisms
   underlying species assemblages and biotic interactions across a wide
   range of organisms including terrestrial arthropods and to investigate
   consequences for ecosystem processes. Such an approach relies on the
   standardized measurement of functional traits that can be applied across
   taxa and regions. Currently, however, unified methods of trait
   measurements are lacking for terrestrial arthropods and related
   macroinvertebrates (terrestrial invertebrates hereafter). Here, we
   present a comprehensive review and detailed protocol for a set of 29
   traits known to be sensitive to global stressors and to affect ecosystem
   processes and services. We give recommendations how to measure these
   traits under standardized conditions across various terrestrial
   invertebrate taxonomic groups. We provide considerations and approaches
   that apply to almost all traits described, such as the selection of
   species and individuals needed for the measurements, the importance of
   intraspecific trait variability, how many populations or communities to
   sample and over which spatial scales. The approaches outlined here
   provide a means to improve the reliability and predictive power of
   functional traits to explain community assembly, species diversity
   patterns and ecosystem processes and services within and across taxa and
   trophic levels, allowing comparison of studies and running meta-analyses
   across regions and ecosystems. This handbook is a crucial first step
   towards standardizing trait methodology across the most studied
   terrestrial invertebrate groups, and the protocols are aimed to balance
   general applicability and requirements for special cases or particular
   taxa. Therefore, we envision this handbook as a common platform to which
   researchers can further provide methodological input for additional
   special cases.}},

Abstract = {{Meiotic drivers are genetic variants that selfishly manipulate the
   production of gametes to increase their own rate of transmission, often
   to the detriment of the rest of the genome and the individual that
   carries them. This genomic conflict potentially occurs whenever a
   diploid organism produces a haploid stage, and can have profound
   evolutionary impacts on gametogenesis, fertility, individual behaviour,
   mating system, population survival, and reproductive isolation. Multiple
   research teams are developing artificial drive systems for pest control,
   utilising the transmission advantage of drive to alter or exterminate
   target species. Here, we review current knowledge of how natural drive
   systems function, how drivers spread through natural populations, and
   the factors that limit their invasion.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{218}},
Pages = {{1035-1046}},
Abstract = {{We investigated area changes in glaciers covering an area of similar to
   200 km(2) in the Tista basin, Sikkim, Eastern Indian Himalaya, between
   similar to 1990 and 2010 using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Indian
   Remote-sensing Satellite (IRS) images and related the changes to debris
   cover, supraglacial lakes and moraine-dam lakes. The glaciers lost an
   area of 3.3 +/- 0.8\% between 1989/90 and 2010. More detailed analysis
   revealed an area loss of 2.00 +/- 0.82, 2.56 +/- 0.61 and 2.28 +/- 2.01
   km(2) for the periods 1989-97, 1997-2004/05 and 2004-2009/10,
   respectively. This indicates an accelerated retreat of glaciers after
   1997. On further analysis, we observed (1) the formation and expansion
   of supraglacial lakes on many debris-covered glaciers and (2) the
   merging of these lakes over time, leading to the development of large
   moraine-dam lakes. We also observed that debris-covered glaciers with
   lakes lose a greater area than debris-covered glaciers without lakes and
   debris-free glaciers. The climatic data for 24 years (1987-2011),
   measured at the Gangtok meteorological station (1812 m a.s.l.), showed
   that the region experienced a 1.0 degrees C rise in the summer minimum
   temperature and a 2.0 degrees C rise in the winter minimum temperature,
   indicating hotter summers and warmer winters. There was no significant
   trend in the total annual precipitation. We find that glacier retreat is
   caused mainly by a temperature increase and that debris-covered glaciers
   can retreat at a faster rate than debris-free glaciers, if associated
   with lakes.}},

Title = {{Fruit production in three masting tree species does not rely on stored

Volume = {{171}},
Number = {{3, SI}},

Abstract = {{Fruiting is typically considered to massively burden the seasonal carbon
   budget of trees. The cost of reproduction has therefore been suggested
   as a proximate factor explaining observed mast-fruiting patterns. Here,
   we used a large-scale, continuous C-13 labeling of mature, deciduous
   trees in a temperate Swiss forest to investigate to what extent fruit
   formation in three species with masting reproduction behavior (Carpinus
   betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea) relies on the import of
   stored carbon reserves. Using a free-air CO2 enrichment system, we
   exposed trees to C-13-depleted CO2 during 8 consecutive years. By the
   end of this experiment, carbon reserve pools had significantly lower
   delta C-13 values compared to control trees. delta C-13 analysis of new
   biomass during the first season after termination of the CO2 enrichment
   allowed us to distinguish the sources of built-in carbon (old carbon
   reserves vs. current assimilates). Flowers and expanding leaves carried
   a significant C-13 label from old carbon stores. In contrast, fruits and
   vegetative infructescence tissues were exclusively produced from
   current, unlabeled photoassimilates in all three species, including F.
   sylvatica, which had a strong masting season. Analyses of delta C-13 in
   purified starch from xylem of fruit-bearing shoots revealed a complete
   turn-over of starch during the season, likely due to its usage for bud
   break. This study is the first to directly demonstrate that fruiting is
   independent from old carbon reserves in masting trees, with significant
   implications for mechanistic models that explain mast seeding.}},

Title = {{Glacier changes and climate trends derived from multiple sources in the
   data scarce Cordillera Vilcanota region, southern Peruvian Andes}},
Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{103-118}},
Abstract = {{The role of glaciers as temporal water reservoirs is particularly
   pronounced in the (outer) tropics because of the very distinct wet/dry
   seasons. Rapid glacier retreat caused by climatic changes is thus a
   major concern, and decision makers demand urgently for regional/local
   glacier evolution trends, ice mass estimates and runoff assessments.
   However, in remote mountain areas, spatial and temporal data coverage is
   typically very scarce and this is further complicated by a high spatial
   and temporal variability in regions with complex topography. Here, we
   present an approach on how to deal with these constraints. For the
   Cordillera Vilcanota (southern Peruvian Andes), which is the second
   largest glacierized cordillera in Peru (after the Cordillera Blanca) and
   also comprises the Quelccaya Ice Cap, we assimilate a comprehensive
   multi-decadal collection of available glacier and climate data from
   multiple sources (satellite images, meteorological station data and
   climate reanalysis), and analyze them for respective changes in glacier
   area and volume and related trends in air temperature, precipitation and
   in a more general manner for specific humidity. While we found only
   marginal glacier changes between 1962 and 1985, there has been a massive
   ice loss since 1985 (about 30\% of area and about 45\% of volume). These
   high numbers corroborate studies from other glacierized cordilleras in
   Peru. The climate data show overall a moderate increase in air
   temperature, mostly weak and not significant trends for precipitation
   sums and probably cannot in full explain the observed substantial ice
   loss. Therefore, the likely increase of specific humidity in the upper
   troposphere, where the glaciers are located, is further discussed and we
   conclude that it played a major role in the observed massive ice loss of
   the Cordillera Vilcanota over the past decades.}},

Abstract = {{Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are highly mobile mixtures of water
   and sediment that occur suddenly and are capable of traveling tens to
   hundreds of kilometers with peak discharges and volumes several orders
   of magnitude larger than those of normal floods. They travel along

   regions, and thus pose a risk to people and infrastructure. Many recent
   events involve process chains, such as mass movements impacting glacial
   lakes and triggering dam breaches with subsequent outburst floods. A
   concern is that effects of climate change and associated increased
   instability of high mountain slopes may exacerbate such process chains
   and associated extreme flows. Modeling tools can be used to assess the
   hazard of potential future GLOFs, and process modeling can provide
   insights into complex processes that are difficult to observe in nature.
   A number of numerical models have been developed and applied to simulate
   different types of extreme flows, but such modeling faces challenges
   stemming from a lack of process understanding and difficulties in
   measuring extreme flows for calibration purposes. Here we review the
   state of knowledge of key aspects of modeling GLOFs, with a focus on
   process cascades. Analysis and simulation of the onset, propagation, and
   potential impact of GLOFs are based on illustrative case studies.
   Numerical models are presently available for simulating impact waves in
   lakes, dam failures, and flow propagation but have been used only to a
   limited extent for integrated simulations of process cascades. We
   present a spectrum of case studies from Patagonia, the European Alps,
   central Asia, and the Himalayas in which we simulate single processes
   and process chains of past and potential future events. We conclude that
   process understanding and process chain modeling need to be strengthened
   and that research efforts should focus on a more integrative treatment
   of processes in numerical models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Rare species are increasingly recognized as crucial, yet vulnerable
   components of Earth's ecosystems. This is also true for microbial
   communities, which are typically composed of a high number of relatively
   rare species. Recent studies have demonstrated that rare species can
   have an over-proportional role in biogeochemical cycles and may be a
   hidden driver of microbiome function. In this review, we provide an
   ecological overview of the rare microbial biosphere, including causes of
   rarity and the impacts of rare species on ecosystem functioning. We
   discuss how rare species can have a preponderant role for local
   biodiversity and species turnover with rarity potentially bound to
   phylogenetically conserved features. Rare microbes may therefore be
   overlooked keystone species regulating the functioning of
   host-associated, terrestrial and aquatic environments. We conclude this
   review with recommendations to guide scientists interested in
   investigating this rapidly emerging research area.}},

Abstract = {{Transdisciplinarity integrates or relates different epistemics from
   science and practice (Mode 2 transdisciplinarity) or from branches of
   disciplines if interdisciplinary integration is impossible (Mode 1
   transdisciplinarity). The paper explains, based on an analysis of the
   historical development of the Mode 2 transdisciplinarity concept, how
   transdisciplinary processes link interdisciplinary applied research and
   multi-stakeholder discourses by facilitating methods. We elaborate on
   what type of problems may be managed using what knowledge, how this
   might be accomplished, what types of objectives are desired, and by what
   organizational means. Thus the paper presents ontology, epistemology,
   methodology, functionality, and organization of an ideal type of
   transdisciplinary process. Socially robust orientations are the expected
   outcomes of this process. These orientations provide science-based,
   state-of-the-art, socially accepted options of solutions which
   acknowledge uncertainties and the incompleteness of different forms of
   epistemics (i.e., of knowing or thought), in particular within the

Abstract = {{Several studies have reported how tillage and cropping systems affect
   quantity, quality, and distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) along
   the profile. However, the effect of soil management on the chemical
   structure of SOM and on its hydrophobic and hydrophilic components has
   been little investigated. In this work, the long-term (19years) effects
   of two cropping systems (wheat monoculture and wheat/faba bean rotation)
   and three tillage managements (conventional, reduced, and no tillage) on
   some chemical characteristics of SOM and their relationships with labile
   carbon (C) pools were evaluated. Soil samples were taken from the
   topsoil (0-15cm) of a Chromic Haploxerert (central Sicily, Italy). After
   19years of different tillage and cropping systems management, total
   organic C significantly differed among treatments with the labile
   organic C pools showing the greater amount in no till and in wheat/faba
   bean plots. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic components of SOM, determined by
   diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, were mainly
   affected by cropping system, whereas aromatic components of SOM by
   tillage. Soil organic matter components and characteristics showed
   significant correlations with the soil biochemical parameters,
   confirming the expected synergism between chemical and biochemical
   properties. This study demonstrated that (i) no tillage and crop
   rotation improve the chemical and biochemical properties of SOM of
   Vertisols under semiarid environment; and (ii) tillage management and
   cropping systems have affected, after 19years, more the chemical and
   biochemical properties of SOM than its quantity. Copyright (c) 2014 John

Abstract = {{Plant defense against herbivores may compromise attraction of
   mutualists, yet information remains limited about the mechanisms
   underlying such signaling tradeoffs.
   Here, we investigated the effects of foliar herbivory by two herbivore
   species on defense compounds, floral signaling, pollinator and
   parasitoid attraction, and seed production.
   Herbivory generally reduced the quantity of many floral volatile organic
   compounds VOCs) in Brassica rapa. By contrast, floral color, flower
   diameter, and plant height remained unaffected. The decreased amounts of
   floral volatiles led to reduced attractiveness of flowers to
   pollinators, but increased the attractiveness of herbivore-infested
   plants to parasitoids. Plants infested with the native butterfly Pieris
   brassicae produced more flowers during early flowering, effectively
   compensating for the lower olfactory attractiveness. Herbivory by the
   invasive Spodoptera littoralis increased the amounts of
   glucobrassicanapin, and led to delayed flowering. These plants tended to
   attract fewer pollinators and to produce fewer seeds.
   Our study indicates a tradeoff between pollinator attraction and
   indirect defense (parasitoid attraction), which can be mitigated by
   reduced floral VOC emission and production of more early flowers. We
   suggest that this compensatory mechanism is specific to plant-herbivore
   associations with a coevolutionary history.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous infection by multiple parasite species is ubiquitous in
   nature. Interactions among co-infecting parasites may have important
   consequences for disease severity, transmission and community-level
   responses to perturbations. However, our current view of parasite
   interactions in nature comes primarily from observational studies, which
   may be unreliable at detecting interactions. We performed a perturbation
   experiment in wild mice, by using an anthelminthic to suppress
   nematodes, and monitored the consequences for other parasite species.
   Overall, these parasite communities were remarkably stable to
   perturbation. Only one non-target parasite species responded to
   deworming, and this response was temporary: we found strong, but
   short-lived, increases in the abundance of Eimeria protozoa, which share
   an infection site with the dominant nematode species, suggesting local,
   dynamic competition. These results, providing a rare and clear
   experimental demonstration of interactions between helminths and
   co-infecting parasites in wild vertebrates, constitute an important step
   towards understanding the wider consequences of similar drug treatments
   in humans and animals.}},

Abstract = {{Nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (NCCs) were described as products
   of chlorophyll breakdown in Arabidopsis thaliana. NCCs are
   formyloxobilin-type catabolites derived from chlorophyll by oxygenolytic
   opening of the chlorin macrocycle. These linear tetrapyrroles are
   generated from their fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite (FCC) precursors
   by a nonenzymatic isomerization inside the vacuole of senescing cells.
   Here, we identified a group of distinct dioxobilin-type chlorophyll
   catabolites (DCCs) as the major breakdown products in wild-type
   Arabidopsis, representing more than 90\% of the chlorophyll of green
   leaves. The molecular constitution of the most abundant nonfluorescent
   DCC (NDCC), At-NDCC-1, was determined. We further identified cytochrome
   P450 monooxygenase CYP89A9 as being responsible for NDCC accumulation in
   wild-type Arabidopsis; cyp89a9 mutants that are deficient in CYP89A9
   function were devoid of NDCCs but accumulated proportionally higher
   amounts of NCCs. CYP89A9 localized outside the chloroplasts, implying
   that FCCs occurring in the cytosol might be its natural substrate. Using
   recombinant CYP89A9, we confirm FCC specificity and show that
   fluorescent DCCs are the products of the CYP89A9 reaction. Fluorescent
   DCCs, formed by this enzyme, isomerize to the respective NDCCs in weakly
   acidic medium, as found in vacuoles. We conclude that CYP89A9 is
   involved in the formation of dioxobilin-type catabolites of chlorophyll
   in Arabidopsis.}},

Title = {{Species delimitation and relationships: The dance of the seven veils}},
Journal = {{TAXON}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-16}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{An increasing number of studies using genetic data at the generic and
   species levels reveal complex patterns of relationships among
   populations and species. Incomplete lineage sorting and reticulation
   are, for instance, commonly observed in low-rank phylogenies. These two
   processes falsify the simplifying assumptions often used when
   reconstructing phylogenetic relationships or when assigning specimens to
   species using barcodes, i.e., the absence of ancestral polymorphism or
   the obligate dichotomous relationship among species. We recognize seven
   processes that act as veils to obscure species boundaries and
   relationships and lead to erroneous interpretations if not diagnosed and
   analysed properly. These processes include the transfer of genetic
   material from plastids or mitochondria to the nuclear genome (NuPt,
   NuMt), hybridization, the stochasticity of lineage sorting within and
   among species, genome organization, species demography, selection,
   genetic and geographic structure. Most of these processes have a direct
   impact on species effective population sizes, a central parameter to be
   considered. Failure to take the seven processes into account can affect
   the accuracy of barcode-based identification, in particular between
   closely related species. It can also bias the delimitation of species,
   result in inaccurate estimations of species relationships and lead to
   incorrect estimation of species ages. We suggest that these problems can
   be identified and, to some extent, mitigated by ensuring that the full
   spatial and genetic ranges of the species are sampled, and by the use of
   information from all genomes of the species. By analysing numerous loci,
   each as a separate entity in a coalescence framework, it is possible to
   take into account stochasticity as well as variation in genome effective
   population sizes. Such a critical approach would allow the use of
   genetic data to make realistic assessments of species delimitation,
   affinities and ages, and should promote a more biologically realistic
   view of species and speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators visit flowers for rewards and should therefore have a
   preference for floral signals that indicate reward status, so called
   honest signals'. We investigated honest signalling in Brassica rapa L.
   and its relevance for the attraction of a generalised pollinator, the
   bumble bee Bombus terrestris (L.). We found a positive association
   between reward amount (nectar sugar and pollen) and the floral scent
   compound phenylacetaldehyde. Bumble bees developed a preference for
   phenylacetaldehyde over other scent compounds after foraging on B. rapa.
   When foraging on artificial flowers scented with synthetic volatiles,
   bumble bees developed a preference for those specific compounds that
   honestly indicated reward status. These results show that the honesty of
   floral signals can play a key role in their attractiveness to
   pollinators. In plants, a genetic constraint, resource limitation in
   reward and signal production, and sanctions against cheaters may
   contribute to the evolution and maintenance of honest signalling.}},

Abstract = {{Although satellite-based variables have for long been expected to be key
   components to a unified and global biodiversity monitoring strategy, a
   definitive and agreed list of these variables still remains elusive. The
   growth of interest in biodiversity variables observable from space has
   been partly underpinned by the development of the essential biodiversity
   variable (EBV) framework by the Group on Earth Observations -
   Biodiversity Observation Network, which itself was guided by the process
   of identifying essential climate variables. This contribution aims to
   advance the development of a global biodiversity monitoring strategy by
   updating the previously published definition of EBV, providing a
   definition of satellite remote sensing (SRS) EBVs and introducing a set
   of principles that are believed to be necessary if ecologists and space
   agencies are to agree on a list of EBVs that can be routinely monitored
   from space. Progress toward the identification of SRS-EBVs will require
   a clear understanding of what makes a biodiversity variable essential,
   as well as agreement on who the users of the SRS-EBVs are. Technological
   and algorithmic developments are rapidly expanding the set of
   opportunities for SRS in monitoring biodiversity, and so the list of
   SRS-EBVs is likely to evolve over time. This means that a clear and
   common platform for data providers, ecologists, environmental managers,
   policy makers and remote sensing experts to interact and share ideas
   needs to be identified to support long-term coordinated actions.}},

Abstract = {{Poales represents more than one-third of all monocotyledons (c. 20 000
   species in 16 families) and constitutes a microcosm of the angiosperms.
   The extreme variation in species richness among the families of Poales
   is still not understood: Poaceae includes similar to 10 000 species,
   whereas six families have fewer than ten species. Here, using the
   largest phylogenetic analysis of Poales to date, molecular dating,
   ancestral reconstructions and diversification analyses, we develop a
   macro-evolutionary and macro-ecological approach to seek correlates for
   changing diversification patterns. We show that the poalean families
   diverged in the Late Cretaceous, a time of high levels of CO2 and high
   rainfall. Our habitat reconstructions indicate that Poales inhabited
   open and dry habitats in this environment. We also demonstrate that
   lineages with CO2-concentrating mechanisms inhabiting dry and open
   environments exhibited higher diversification rates than C-3, shade and
   wet lineages. CO2-concentrating mechanisms counteract the effects of low
   atmospheric CO2 and reduce phototranspiration. It is believed that the
   parallel evolution of C-4 and CAM (Crassulacean acid metabolism)
   photosynthesis in Poaceae, Cyperaceae and Bromeliaceae is an adaptation
   to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Combinations of extrinsic
   and intrinsic factors might have played a role in shifts in

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{4-20}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Chlorophyll breakdown is the most obvious sign of leaf senescence and
   fruit ripening. A multistep pathway has been elucidated in recent years
   that can be divided into two major parts. In the first phase, which
   commonly is active in higher plants, chlorophyll is converted via
   several photoreactive intermediates to a primary colorless breakdown
   product within the chloroplast. The second part of chlorophyll breakdown
   takes place in the cytosol and the vacuole. During this phase, the
   primary colorless intermediate is modified in largely species-specific
   reactions to a number of similar, yet structurally different, linear
   tetrapyrrolic products that finally are stored within the vacuole of
   senescing cells. To date, most of the biochemical reactions of the first
   phase of chlorophyll breakdown have been elucidated and genes have been
   identified. By contrast, mechanisms of catabolite transport and
   modification during the second phase are largely unknown. This review
   summarizes the current knowledge on the biochemical reactions involved
   in chlorophyll breakdown, with a special focus on the second-phase
   reactions and the fate of by-products that are released from chlorophyll
   during its breakdown.}},

Title = {{A comparison of the strength of biodiversity effects across multiple

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In order to predict which ecosystem functions are most at risk from
   biodiversity loss, meta-analyses have generalised results from
   biodiversity experiments over different sites and ecosystem types. In
   contrast, comparing the strength of biodiversity effects across a large
   number of ecosystem processes measured in a single experiment permits
   more direct comparisons. Here, we present an analysis of 418 separate
   measures of 38 ecosystem processes. Overall, 45 \% of processes were
   significantly affected by plant species richness, suggesting that, while
   diversity affects a large number of processes not all respond to
   biodiversity. We therefore compared the strength of plant diversity
   effects between different categories of ecosystem processes, grouping
   processes according to the year of measurement, their biogeochemical
   cycle, trophic level and compartment (above- or belowground) and
   according to whether they were measures of biodiversity or other
   ecosystem processes, biotic or abiotic and static or dynamic. Overall,
   and for several individual processes, we found that biodiversity effects
   became stronger over time. Measures of the carbon cycle were also
   affected more strongly by plant species richness than were the measures
   associated with the nitrogen cycle. Further, we found greater plant
   species richness effects on measures of biodiversity than on other
   processes. The differential effects of plant diversity on the various
   types of ecosystem processes indicate that future research and political
   effort should shift from a general debate about whether biodiversity
   loss impairs ecosystem functions to focussing on the specific functions
   of interest and ways to preserve them individually or in combination.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation forms a main component of the terrestrial biosphere and plays
   a crucial role in land-cover and climate-related studies. Activity of
   vegetation systems is commonly quantified using remotely sensed
   vegetation indices (VI). Extensive reports on temporal trends over the
   past decades in time series of such indices can be found in literature.
   However, little remains known about the processes underlying these
   changes at large spatial scales. In this study, we aimed at quantifying
   the spatial relationship between changes in potential climatic growth
   constraints (i.e. temperature, precipitation and incident solar
   radiation) and changes in vegetation activity (19822008). We demonstrate
   an additive spatial model with 0.5 degrees resolution, consisting of a
   regression component representing climate-associated effects and a
   spatially correlated field representing the combined influence of other
   factors, including land-use change. Little over 50\% of the spatial
   variance could be attributed to changes in climatologies; conspicuously,
   many greening trends and browning hotspots in Argentina and Australia.
   The nonassociated model component may contain large-scale human
   interventions, feedback mechanisms or natural effects, which were not
   captured by the climatologies. Browning hotspots in this component were
   especially found in subequatorial Africa. On the scale of land-cover
   types, strongest relationships between climatologies and vegetation
   activity were found in forests, including indications for browning under
   warming conditions (analogous to the divergence issue discussed in
   dendroclimatology).}},

Abstract = {{Personal and political action on climate change is traditionally thought
   to be motivated by people accepting its reality and importance. However,
   convincing the public that climate change is real faces powerful
   ideological obstacles(1-4), and climate change is slipping in public
   importance in many countries(.)(5,6) Here we investigate a different
   approach, identifying whether potential co-benefits of addressing
   climate change(7) could motivate pro-environmental behaviour around the
   world for both those convinced and unconvinced that climate change is
   real. We describe an integrated framework for assessing beliefs about
   co-benefits(8), distinguishing social conditions (for example, economic
   development, reduced pollution or disease) and community character (for
   example, benevolence, competence). Data from all inhabited continents
   (24 countries; 6,196 participants) showed that two co-benefit types,
   Development (economic and scientific advancement) and Benevolence (a
   more moral and caring community), motivated public, private and
   financial actions to address climate change to a similar degree as
   believing climate change is important. Critically, relationships were
   similar for both convinced and unconvinced participants, showing that
   co-benefits can motivate action across ideological divides. These
   relationships were also independent of perceived climate change
   importance, and could not be explained by political ideology, age, or
   gender. Communicating co-benefits could motivate action on climate
   change where traditional approaches have stalled.}},

Abstract = {{Thick debris cover on glaciers can significantly reduce ice melt.
   However, several studies have suggested that debris-covered glaciers in
   the Himalaya might have lost mass at a rate similar to debris-free
   glaciers. We reconstruct elevation and mass changes for the
   debris-covered glaciers of the upper Langtang valley, Nepalese Himalaya,
   using a digital elevation model (DEM) from 1974 stereo Hexagon satellite
   data and the 2000 SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM.
   Uncertainties are high in the accumulation areas, due to data gaps in
   the SRTM and difficulties with delineation of the glacier borders. Even
   with these uncertainties, we obtain thinning rates comparable to those
   of several other studies in the Himalaya. In particular, we obtain a
   total mass balance for the investigated debris-covered glaciers of the
   basin of -0.32 +/- 0.18 m w.e. a(-1). However, there are major spatial
   differences both between glaciers and within any single glacier,
   exhibiting a very distinct nonlinear mass-balance profile with
   elevation. Through analysis of surface velocities derived from Landsat
   ETM+ imagery, we show that thinning occurs in areas of low velocity and
   low slope. These areas are prone to a general, dynamic decay of surface
   features and to the development of supraglacial lakes and ice cliffs,
   which may be responsible for a considerable increase in overall glacier
   ablation.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of humpback dolphins, distributed in coastal waters of
   the Indo-West Pacific and eastern Atlantic Oceans, has been hindered by
   a lack of understanding about the number of species in the genus (Sousa)
   and their population structure. To address this issue, we present a
   combined analysis of genetic and morphologic data collected from
   beach-cast, remote-biopsied and museum specimens from throughout the
   known Sousa range. We extracted genetic sequence data from 235 samples
   from extant populations and explored the mitochondrial control region
   and four nuclear introns through phylogenetic, population-level and
   population aggregation frameworks. In addition, 180 cranial specimens
   from the same geographical regions allowed comparisons of 24
   morphological characters through multivariate analyses. The genetic and
   morphological data showed significant and concordant patterns of
   geographical segregation, which are typical for the kind of demographic
   isolation displayed by species units, across the Sousa genus
   distribution range. Based on our combined genetic and morphological
   analyses, there is convincing evidence for at least four species within
   the genus (S.teuszii in the Atlantic off West Africa, S.plumbea in the
   central and western Indian Ocean, S.chinensis in the eastern Indian and
   West Pacific Oceans, and a new as-yet-unnamed species off northern
   Australia).}},

Title = {{Wheat syntenome unveils new evidences of contrasted evolutionary

Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Bread wheat derives from a grass ancestor structured in seven
   protochromosomes followed by a paleotetraploidization to reach a 12
   chromosomes intermediate and a neohexaploidization (involving subgenomes
   A, B and D) event that finally shaped the 21 modern chromosomes.
   Insights into wheat syntenome in sequencing conserved orthologous set
   (COS) genes unravelled differences in genomic structure (such as gene
   conservation and diversity) and genetical landscape (such as
   recombination pattern) between ancestral as well as recent duplicated
   blocks. Contrasted evolutionary plasticity is observed where the B
   subgenome appears more sensitive (i.e. plastic) in contrast to A as
   dominant (i.e. stable) in response to the neotetraploidization and D
   subgenome as supra-dominant (i.e. pivotal) in response to the
   neohexaploidization event. Finally, the wheat syntenome, delivered
   through a public web interface PlantSyntenyViewer at
   http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/synteny-wheat, can be considered as a
   guide for accelerated dissection of major agronomical traits in wheat.}},

Abstract = {{Capturing and quantifying the world in three dimensions (x,y,z) using
   light detection and ranging (lidar) technology drives fundamental
   advances in the Earth and Ecological Sciences (EES). However, additional
   lidar dimensions offer the possibility to transcend basic 3-D mapping
   capabilities, including i) the physical time (t) dimension from repeat
   lidar acquisition and ii) laser return intensity (LRIK) data dimension
   based on the brightness of single- or multi-wavelength (lambda) laser
   returns. The additional dimensions thus add to the x,y, and z dimensions
   to constitute the five dimensions of lidar (x.y,z, t, lambda n). This
   broader spectrum of lidar dimensionality has already revealed new
   insights across multiple EES topics, and will enable a wide range of new
   research and applications. Here, we review recent advances based on
   repeat lidar collections and analysis of LRI data to highlight novel
   applications of lidar remote sensing beyond 3-D. Our review outlines the
   potential and current challenges of time and LRI information from lidar
   sensors to expand the scope of research applications and insights across
   the full range of EES applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Human actions challenge nature in many ways. Ecological responses are
   ineluctably complex, demanding measures that describe them succinctly.
   Collectively, these measures encapsulate the overall `stability' of the
   system. Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental
   Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly
   aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies
   frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear definition.
   Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large
   body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the
   scientific and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one
   consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that
   ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led
   to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of
   our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multidimensional.
   Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor
   understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that
   define many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global
   change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and
   policy-makers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of
   ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a discriminative multiple kernel learning
   (DMKL) method for spectral image classification. The core idea of the
   proposed method is to learn an optimal combined kernel from predefined
   basic kernels by maximizing separability in reproduction kernel Hilbert
   space. DMKL achieves the maximum separability via finding an optimal
   projective direction according to statistical significance, which leads
   to the minimum within-class scatter and maximum between-class scatter
   instead of a time-consuming search for the optimal kernel combination.
   Fisher criterion (FC) and maximum margin criterion (MMC) are used to
   find the optimal projective direction, thus leading to two variants of
   the proposed method, DMKL-FC and DMK-L-MMC, respectively. After learning
   the projective direction, all basic kernels are projected to generate a
   discriminative combined kernel. Three merits are realized by DMKL.
   First, DMKL can achieve a substantial improvement in classification
   performance without strict limitation for selection of basic kernels.
   Second, the discriminating scales of a Gaussian kernel, the useful bands
   for classification, and the competitive sizes of spatial filters can be
   selected by ranking the corresponding weights, where the large weights
   correspond to the most relevant. Third, DMKL reduces the computational
   burden by requiring fewer support vectors. Experiments are conducted on
   two hyperspectral data sets and one multispectral data set. The
   corresponding experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   algorithms can achieve the best performance with satisfactory
   computational efficiency for spectral image classification, compared
   with several state-of-the-art algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The RAdiative transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) activity focuses on
   the benchmarking of canopy radiative transfer (RT) models. For the
   current fourth phase of RAMI, six highly realistic virtual plant
   environments were constructed on the basis of intensive field data
   collected from (both deciduous and coniferous) forest stands as well as
   test sites in Europe and South Africa. Twelve RT modelling groups
   provided simulations of canopy scale (directional and hemispherically
   integrated) radiative quantities, as well as a series of binary
   hemispherical photographs acquired from different locations within the
   virtual canopies. The simulation results showed much greater variance
   than those recently analysed for the abstract canopy scenarios of
   RAMI-IV. Canopy complexity is among the most likely drivers behind
   operator induced errors that gave rise to the discrepancies. Conformity
   testing was introduced to separate the simulation results into
   acceptable and non-acceptable contributions. More specifically, a shared
   risk approach is used to evaluate the compliance of RI model simulations
   on the basis of reference data generated with the weighted ensemble
   averaging technique from ISO-13528. However, using concepts from legal
   metrology, the uncertainty of this reference solution will be shown to
   prevent a confident assessment of model performance with respect to the
   selected tolerance intervals. As an alternative, guarded risk decision
   rules will be presented to account explicitly for the uncertainty
   associated with the reference and candidate methods. Both guarded
   acceptance and guarded rejection approaches are used to make confident
   statements about the acceptance and/or rejection of RT model simulations
   with respect to the predefined tolerance intervals. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{The recent trend for journals to require open access to primary data
   included in publications has been embraced by many biologists, but has
   caused apprehension amongst researchers engaged in long-term ecological
   and evolutionary studies. A worldwide survey of 73 principal
   investigators (PIs) with long-term studies revealed positive attitudes
   towards sharing data with the agreement or involvement of the PI, and
   93\% of PIs have historically shared data. Only 8\% were in favor of
   uncontrolled, open access to primary data while 63\% expressed serious
   concern. We present here their viewpoint on an issue that can have
   non-trivial scientific consequences. We discuss potential costs of
   public data archiving and provide possible solutions to meet the needs
   of journals and researchers.}},

Abstract = {{Mountains are often more species-rich than lowlands. This could be the
   result of migration from lowlands to mountains, of a greater survival
   rate in mountains, or of a higher diversification rate in mountains. We
   investigated this question in the globally distributed family Ericaceae,
   which includes c. 4426 species ranging from sea level to >5000m. We
   predict that the interaction of low specific leaf area (SLA) and montane
   habitats is correlated with increased diversification rates. A molecular
   phylogeny of Ericaceae based on rbcL and matK sequence data was built
   and dated with 18 fossil calibrations and divergence time estimates. We
   identified radiations using bamm and correlates of diversification rate
   changes using binary-state speciation and extinction (BiSSE) and
   multiple-state speciation and extinction (MuSSE) analyses. Analyses
   revealed six largely montane radiations. Lineages in mountains
   diversified faster than nonmountain lineages (higher speciation rate,
   but no difference in extinction rate), and lineages with low SLA
   diversified faster than high-SLA lineages. Further, habitat and trait
   had a positive interactive effect on diversification. Our results
   suggest that the species richness in mountains is the result of
   increased speciation rather than reduced extinction or increased
   immigration. Increased speciation in Ericaceae was facilitated by low
   SLA.}},

Abstract = {{Diphosphorylated inositol polyphosphates, also referred to as inositol
   pyrophosphates, are important signaling molecules that regulate critical
   cellular activities in many eukaryotic organisms, such as membrane
   trafficking, telomere maintenance, ribosome biogenesis, and apoptosis.
   In mammals and fungi, two distinct classes of inositol phosphate kinases
   mediate biosynthesis of inositol pyrophosphates: Kcs1/IP6K- and
   Vip1/PPIP5K-like proteins. Here, we report that PPIP5K homologs are
   widely distributed in plants and that Arabidopsis thaliana VIH1 and VIH2
   are functional PPIP5K enzymes. We show a specific induction of inositol
   pyrophosphate InsP(8) by jasmonate and demonstrate that steady state and
   jasmonate-induced pools of InsP(8) in Arabidopsis seedlings depend on
   VIH2. We identify a role of VIH2 in regulating jasmonate perception and
   plant defenses against herbivorous insects and necrotrophic fungi. In
   silico docking experiments and radioligand binding-based reconstitution
   assays show high-affinity binding of inositol pyrophosphates to the
   F-box protein COI1-JAZ jasmonate coreceptor complex and suggest that
   coincidence detection of jasmonate and InsP(8) by COI1-JAZ is a critical
   component in jasmonate-regulated defenses.}},

Title = {{Impact of varying irradiance on vegetation indices and chlorophyll

Abstract = {{Imaging spectroscopy (IS) provides an efficient tool to assess
   vegetation status and functioning at ecologically relevant scales.
   Reliable extraction of vegetation information from spatial and spectral
   high resolution spectroscopy data requires accurate retrieval schemes to
   account for the complex radiative transfer in the coupled
   vegetationatmosphere system. Particularly the coupling of the atmosphere
   and vegetation considering combined effects of anisotropy, absorption
   and scattering typically relies on many assumptions, rendering estimates
   of direct (E-dir) and diffuse (E-dif) surface irradiance error prone.
   This impacts the reliability of retrieved vegetation properties. In this
   study we discuss and quantify the retrieval sensitivity of vegetation
   information using high resolution IS data to inaccurate assumptions of
   direct and diffuse surface irradiance. We use observations and
   simulations and focus on the two vegetation indices normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the photochemical reflectance
   index (PRI), and on sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs). Our
   results indicate that, even if the irradiance field (E) is exactly
   known, reflectance based vegetation indices show an inherent variation
   of 9\% (NDVI) and 12\% (PRI) respectively. These variations are caused
   by complex interactions of surface irradiance and reflectance
   anisotropy. The emitted Fs signal was found to be almost unaffected by
   those variations, if the retrieval considers surface anisotropy.
   Further, estimation of vegetation properties is subject to large
   uncertainties if instantaneous E fields are unknown. In that case, they
   range up to 13\% for the NDVI, up to 32\% for the PRI, and up to 58\%
   for Fs. We conclude that retrieval sensitivities of vegetation indices
   and Fs to illumination effects must be carefully considered in data
   interpretation and suggest using coupled surface-atmosphere models to
   exploit the full information content of IS data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The science associated with the use of airborne and satellite Light
   Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to remotely sense forest structure has
   rapidly progressed over the past decade. LiDAR has evolved from being a
   poorly understood, potentially useful tool to an operational technology
   in a little over a decade, and these instruments have become a major
   success story in terms of their application to the measurement, mapping,
   or monitoring of forests worldwide. Invented in 1960, the laser and, a
   short time later, LiDAR, were found in research and military
   laboratories. Since the early 2000s, commercial technological
   developments coupled with an improved understanding of how to manipulate
   and analyze large amounts of collected data enabled notable scientific
   and application developments. A diversity of rapidly developing fields
   especially benefit from communications offered through conferences such
   as SilviLaser, and LiDAR has been no different. In 2002 the SilviLaser
   conference series was initiated to bring together those interested in
   the development and application of LiDAR for forested environments. Now,
   a little over a decade later, commercial use of LiDAR is common. In this
   paper - using the deliberations of SilviLaser 2012 as a source of
   information - we aim to capture aspects of importance to LiDAR users in
   the forest ecosystems community and to also point to key emerging issues
   as well as some remaining challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Lichenization is assumed to be a very ancient mode of fungal nutrition,
   but fossil records are rare. Here we describe two fragments of
   exceptionally preserved, probably charred, lichen thalli with internal
   stratification. Cyanolichenomycites devonicus has a cyanobacterial and
   Chlorolichenomycites salopensis a unicellular, presumably green algal
   photobiont. Fruiting bodies are missing. Cyanolichenomycites devonicus
   forms asexual spores in a pycnidium. All specimens were examined with
   scanning electron microscopy techniques. The fossils were extracted by
   maceration. Extant lichens and free-living cyanobacteria were either
   experimentally charcoalified for comparison or conventionally prepared.
   Based on their septate hyphal structure, both specimens are tentatively
   interpreted as representatives of the Pezizomycotina (Ascomycota). Their
   presence in 415 million yr (Myr) old rocks from the Welsh Borderland
   predates existing Late Cretaceous records of pycnidial conidiomata by
   some 325 Myr and Triassic records of lichens with broadly similar
   organization by some 195 Myr. These fossils represent the oldest known
   record of lichens with symbionts and anatomy as typically found in
   morphologically advanced taxa today. The latter does not apply to
   Winfrenatia reticulata, the enigmatic crustose lichen fossil from the
   Lower Devonian, nor to presumed lichen-like organisms such as the
   Cambrian Farghera robusta or to the Lower Devonian Spongiophyton
   minutissimum.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial plants have two to four times more ATP-binding cassette

   these transporters exhibit dramatic phenotypes, many of which are
   related to developmental processes and functions necessary for life on
   dry land. These results suggest that ABC transporters multiplied during
   evolution and assumed novel functions that allowed plants to adapt to
   terrestrial environmental conditions. Examining the literature on plant
   ABC transporters from this viewpoint led us to propose that diverse ABC
   transporters enabled many unique and essential aspects of a terrestrial
   plant's lifestyle, by transporting various compounds across specific
   membranes of the plant.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory microcosm experiments using protists as model organisms have
   a long tradition and are widely used to investigate general concepts in
   population biology, community ecology and evolutionary biology. Many
   variables of interest are measured in order to study processes and
   patterns at different spatiotemporal scales and across all levels of
   biological organization. This includes measurements of body size,
   mobility or abundance, in order to understand population dynamics,
   dispersal behaviour and ecosystem processes. Also, a variety of
   manipulations are employed, such as temperature changes or varying
   connectivity in spatial microcosm networks. Past studies, however, have
   used varying methods for maintenance, measurement, and manipulation,
   which hinders across-study comparisons and meta-analyses, and the added
   value they bring. Furthermore, application of techniques such as flow
   cytometry, image and video analyses, and in situ environmental probes
   provide novel and improved opportunities to quantify variables of
   interest at unprecedented precision and temporal resolution. Here, we
   take the first step towards a standardization of well-established and
   novel methods and techniques within the field of protist microcosm
   experiments. We provide a comprehensive overview of maintenance,
   measurement and manipulation methods. An extensive supplement contains
   detailed protocols of all methods, and these protocols also exist in a
   community updateable online repository. We envision that such a
   synthesis and standardization of methods will overcome shortcomings and
   challenges faced by past studies and also promote activities such as
   meta-analyses and distributed experiments conducted simultaneously
   across many different laboratories at a global scale.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Here we report on angiosperm-like pollen and Afropollis from the Anisian
   (Middle Triassic, 247.2-242.0 Ma) of a mid-latitudinal site in Northern
   Switzerland. Small monosulcate pollen grains with typical reticulate
   (semitectate) sculpture, columellate structure of the sexine and thin
   nexine show close similarities to early angiosperm pollen known from the
   Early Cretaceous. However, they differ in their extremely thin inner
   layer (nexine). Six different pollen types (1 V1) are differentiated
   based on size, reticulation pattern, and exine structure. The described
   pollen grains show all the essential features of angiosperm pollen.
   However, considering the lack of a continuous record throughout the
   lower part of the Mesozoic and the comparison with the oldest Cretaceous
   finds we suggest an affinity to an angiosperm stem group. Together with
   the previously published records from the Middle Triassic of the Barents
   Sea area the angiosperm-like pollen grains reflect a considerable
   diversity of the parent plants during the Middle Triassic.
   Sedimentological evidence and associated palynofloras also suggest a
   remarkable ecological range for these plants. Associated with these
   grains we found pollen comparable to the genus Afropollis.
   Representatives of this genus are commonly recorded in Lower Cretaceous
   sediments of low latitudes, but until now had no record from the lower
   part of the Mesozoic.}},

Abstract = {{Group-living animals often do not maintain territories, but instead have
   highly overlapping ranges, even though in principle these are
   economically defendable. We investigate whether this absence of range
   defence reflects a collective action problem, since a territory can be
   considered a public good. In a comparative analysis comprising 135
   primate species, we find a positive association between range overlap
   and group size, controlling for economic defendability and phylogenetic
   non-independence. We subsequently demonstrate that groups with multiple
   adults of both sexes suffer levels of range overlap twice as high as
   groups with only a single adult representative of either sex, consistent
   with the presence of a collective action problem. Finally, we reveal
   that this collective action problem can be overcome through philopatry
   of the larger sex. These results suggest that a social complication of
   group living is a stronger determinant of between-group relations among
   social animals than ecological factors, but also that collective defence
   is still achieved where the dominant sex is philopatric and effective
   defence is critical to reproductive success and survival. In addition,
   our findings support the idea that human-like warfare, defined as
   escalated collective territorial conflict, has an evolutionary basis
   reflected by cases of convergent evolution among non-human primates.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of studying the recent Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) surface
   mass balance (SMB) decrease relative to the last century, we have forced
   the regional climate MAR (ModSle Atmospherique Regional; version 3.5.2)
   model with the ERA-Interim (ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis; 1979-2015),
   ERA-40 (1958-2001), NCEP-NCARv1 (National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis version
   1; 19482015), NCEP-NCARv2 (1979-2015), JRA-55 (Japanese 55year
   Reanalysis; 1958-2014), 20CRv2(c) (Twentieth Century Reanalysis version
   2; 1900-2014) and ERA-20C (19002010) reanalyses. While all these forcing
   products are reanalyses that are assumed to represent the same climate,
   they produce significant differences in the MAR-simulated SMB over their
   common period. A temperature adjustment of C 1 ffi C (respectively 1
   degrees C) was, for example, needed at the MAR boundaries with ERA-20C
   (20CRv2) reanalysis, given that ERA-20C (20CRv2) is similar to 1 degrees
   C colder (warmer) than ERAInterim over Greenland during the period
   1980-2010. Comparisons with daily PROMICE (Programme for Monitoring of
   the Greenland Ice Sheet) near-surface observations support these
   adjustments. Comparisons with SMB measurements, ice cores and
   satellite-derived melt extent reveal the most accurate forcing datasets
   for the simulation of the GrIS SMB to be ERA-Interim and NCEP-NCARv1.
   However, some biases remain in MAR, suggesting that some improvements
   are still needed in its cloudiness and radiative schemes as well as in
   the representation of the bare ice albedo. Results from all MAR
   simulations indicate that (i) the period 1961-1990, commonly chosen as a
   stable reference period for Greenland SMB and ice dynamics, is actually
   a period of anomalously positive SMB (C 40 Gt yr 1) compared to
   1900-2010; (ii) SMB has decreased significantly after this reference
   period due to increasing and unprecedented melt reaching the highest
   rates in the 120-year common period; (iii) before 1960, both ERA-20C and
   20CRv2forced MAR simulations suggest a significant precipitation
   increase over 1900-1950, but this increase could be the result of an
   artefact in the reanalyses that are not well-enough constrained by
   observations during this period and (iv) since the 1980s, snowfall is
   quite stable after having reached a maximum in the 1970s. These
   MAR-based SMB and accumulation reconstructions are, however, quite
   similar to those from Box (2013) after 1930 and confirm that SMB was
   quite stable from the 1940s to the 1990s. Finally, only the
   ERA-20Cforced simulation suggests that SMB during the 1920-1930 warm
   period over Greenland was comparable to the SMB of the 2000s, due to
   both higher melt and lower precipitation than normal.}},

Abstract = {{Highly diverse microbial assemblages colonize plant roots. It is still
   poorly understood whether different members of this root microbiome act
   synergistically by supplying different services (for example, different
   limiting nutrients) to plants and plant communities. In order to test
   this, we manipulated the presence of two widespread plant root
   symbionts, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia
   bacteria in model grassland communities established in axenic
   microcosms. Here, we demonstrate that both symbionts complement each
   other resulting in increased plant diversity, enhanced seedling
   recruitment and improved nutrient acquisition compared with a single
   symbiont situation. Legume seedlings obtained up to 15-fold higher
   productivity if they formed an association with both symbionts, opposed
   to productivity they reached with only one symbiont. Our results reveal
   the importance of functional diversity of symbionts and demonstrate that
   different members of the root microbiome can complement each other in
   acquiring different limiting nutrients and in driving important
   ecosystem functions.}},

Title = {{Climate trends and glacier retreat in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru,
   revisited}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{85-97}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The total glacial area of the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, has shrunk by
   more than 30\% in the period of 1930 to the present with a marked
   glacier retreat also in the recent decades. The aim of this paper is to
   assess local air temperature and precipitation changes in the Cordillera
   Blanca and to discuss how these variables could have affected the
   observed glacier retreat between the 1980s and present. A unique data
   set from a large number of stations in the region of the Cordillera
   Blanca shows that after a strong air temperature rise of about 0.31
   degrees C per decade between 1969 and 1998, a slowdown in the warming to
   about 0.13 degrees C per decade occurred for the 30 years from 1983 to
   2012. Additionally, based on data from a long-term meteorological
   station, it was found that the freezing line altitude during
   precipitation days has probably not increased significantly in the last
   30 years. We documented a cooling trend for maximum daily air
   temperatures and an increase in precipitation of about 60 mm/decade
   since the early 1980s. The strong increase in precipitation in the last
   30 years probably did not balance the increase of temperature before the
   1980s. It is suggested that recent changes in temperature and
   precipitation alone may not explain the glacial recession within the
   thirty years from the early 1980s to 2012. Glaciers in the Cordillera
   Blanca may be still reacting to the positive air temperature rise before
   1980. Especially small and low-lying glaciers are characterised by a
   serious imbalance and may disappear in the near future. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Studies of local floral adaptation in response to geographically
   divergent pollinators are essential for understanding floral evolution.
   This study investigated local pollinator adaptation and variation in
   floral traits in the rewarding orchid Gymnadenia odoratissima, which
   spans a large altitudinal gradient and thus may depend on different
   pollinator guilds along this gradient.
   Pollinator communities were assessed and reciprocal transfer experiments
   were performed between lowland and mountain populations. Differences in
   floral traits were characterized by measuring floral morphology traits,
   scent composition, colour and nectar sugar content in lowland and
   mountain populations.
   The composition of pollinator communities differed considerably between
   lowland and mountain populations; flies were only found as pollinators
   in mountain populations. The reciprocal transfer experiments showed that
   when lowland plants were transferred to mountain habitats, their
   reproductive success did not change significantly. However, when
   mountain plants were moved to the lowlands, their reproductive success
   decreased significantly. Transfers between populations of the same
   altitude did not lead to significant changes in reproductive success,
   disproving the potential for population-specific adaptations. Flower
   size of lowland plants was greater than for mountain flowers. Lowland
   plants also had significantly higher relative amounts of aromatic floral
   volatiles, while the mountain plants had higher relative amounts of
   other floral volatiles. The floral colour of mountain flowers was
   significantly lighter compared with the lowland flowers.
   Local pollinator adaptation through pollinator attraction was shown in
   the mountain populations, possibly due to adaptation to pollinating
   flies. The mountain plants were also observed to receive pollination
   from a greater diversity of pollinators than the lowland plants. The
   different floral phenotypes of the altitudinal regions are likely to be
   the consequence of adaptations to local pollinator guilds.}},

Abstract = {{This contribution examines glacier changes on the south side of Mt.
   Everest from 1962 to 2011 considering five intermediate periods using
   optical satellite imagery. The investigated glaciers cover similar to
   400 km(2) and present among the largest debris coverage (32\%) and the
   highest elevations (5720 m) of the world. We found an overall surface
   area loss of 13.0 +/- 3.1\% (median 0.42 +/- 0.06\% a(-1)), an upward
   shift of 182 +/- 22 m (3.7 +/- 0.5 ma(-1)) in snow-line altitude (SLA),
   a terminus retreat of 403 +/- 9 m (median 6.1 +/- 0.2 ma(-1)), and an
   increase of 17.6 +/- 3.1\% (median 0.20 +/- 0.06\% a(-1)) in debris
   coverage between 1962 and 2011. The recession process of glaciers has
   been relentlessly continuous over the past 50 years. Moreover, we
   observed that (i) glaciers that have increased the debris coverage have
   experienced a reduced termini retreat (r = 0.87, p < 0.001).
   Furthermore, more negative mass balances (i. e., upward shift of SLA)
   induce increases of debris coverage (r = 0.79, p < 0.001); (ii) since
   early 1990s, we observed a slight but statistically insignificant
   acceleration of the surface area loss (0.35 +/- 0.13\% a(-1) in
   1962-1992 vs 0.43 +/- 0.25\% a(-1) in 1992-2011), but an significant
   upward shift of SLA which increased almost three times (2.2 +/- 0.8
   ma(-1) in 1962-1992 vs 6.1 +/- 1.4 ma(-1) in 1992-2011). However, the
   accelerated shrinkage in recent decades (both in terms of surface area
   loss and SLA shift) has only significantly affected glaciers with the
   largest sizes (> 10 km(2)), presenting accumulation zones at higher
   elevations (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) and along the preferable south-north
   direction of the monsoons. Moreover, the largest glaciers present median
   upward shifts of the SLA (220 m) that are nearly double than that of the
   smallest (119 m); this finding leads to a hypothesis that Mt. Everest
   glaciers are shrinking, not only due to warming temperatures, but also
   as a result of weakening Asian monsoons registered over the last few
   decades. We conclude that the shrinkage of the glaciers in south of Mt.
   Everest is less than that of others in the western and eastern Himalaya
   and southern and eastern Tibetan Plateau. Their position in higher
   elevations have likely reduced the impact of warming on these glaciers,
   but have not been excluded from a relentlessly continuous and slow
   recession process over the past 50 years.}},

Abstract = {{Natural genetic variation is essential for the adaptation of organisms
   to their local environment and to changing environmental conditions.
   Here, we examine genomewide patterns of nucleotide variation in natural
   populations of the outcrossing herb Arabidopsis halleri and associations
   with climatic variation among populations in the Alps. Using a pooled
   population sequencing (Pool-Seq) approach, we discovered more than two
   million SNPs in five natural populations and identified highly
   differentiated genomic regions and SNPs using F-ST-based analyses. We
   tested only the most strongly differentiated SNPs for associations with
   a nonredundant set of environmental factors using partial Mantel tests
   to identify topo-climatic factors that may underlie the observed
   footprints of selection. Possible functions of genes showing signatures
   of selection were identified by Gene Ontology analysis. We found 175
   genes to be highly associated with one or more of the five tested
   topo-climatic factors. Of these, 23.4\% had unknown functions. Genetic
   variation in four candidate genes was strongly associated with site
   water balance and solar radiation, and functional annotations were
   congruent with these environmental factors. Our results provide a
   genomewide perspective on the distribution of adaptive genetic variation
   in natural plant populations from a highly diverse and heterogeneous
   alpine environment.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The Lr34 gene encodes an ABC transporter and has provided wheat with
   durable, broad-spectrum resistance against multiple fungal pathogens for
   over 100 years. Because barley does not have an Lr34 ortholog, we
   expressed Lr34 in barley to investigate its potential as a
   broad-spectrum resistance resource in another grass species. We found
   that introduction of the genomic Lr34 sequence confers resistance
   against barley leaf rust and barley powdery mildew, two pathogens
   specific for barley but not virulent on wheat. In addition, the barley
   lines showed enhanced resistance against wheat stem rust. Transformation
   with the Lr34 cDNA or the genomic susceptible Lr34 allele did not result
   in increased resistance. Unlike wheat, where Lr34-conferred resistance
   is associated with adult plants, the genomic Lr34 transgenic barley
   lines exhibited multipathogen resistance in seedlings. These transgenic
   barley lines also developed leaf tip necrosis (LTN) in young seedlings,
   which correlated with an up-regulation of senescence marker genes and
   several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. In wheat, transcriptional
   expression of Lr34 is highest in adult plants and correlates with
   increased resistance and LTN affecting the last emerging leaf. The
   severe phenotype of transgenic Lr34 barley resulted in reduced plant
   growth and total grain weight. These results demonstrate that Lr34
   provides enhanced multipathogen resistance early in barley plant
   development and implies the conservation of the substrate and mechanism
   of the LR34 transporter and its molecular action between wheat and
   barley. With controlled gene expression, the use of Lr34 may be valuable
   for many cereal breeding programmes, particularly given its proven
   durability.}},

Abstract = {{Plant cell expansion is controlled by a fine-tuned balance between
   intracellular turgor pressure, cell wall loosening and cell wall
   biosynthesis. To understand these processes, it is important to gain
   in-depth knowledge of cell wall mechanics. Pollen tubes are tip-growing
   cells that provide an ideal system to study mechanical properties at the
   single cell level. With the available approaches it was not easy to
   measure important mechanical parameters of pollen tubes, such as the
   elasticity of the cell wall. We used a cellular force microscope (CFM)
   to measure the apparent stiffness of lily pollen tubes. In combination
   with a mechanical model based on the finite element method (FEM), this
   allowed us to calculate turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity, which
   we found to be around 0.3MPa and 2090MPa, respectively. Furthermore, and
   in contrast to previous reports, we showed that the difference in
   stiffness between the pollen tube tip and the shank can be explained
   solely by the geometry of the pollen tube. CFM, in combination with an
   FEM-based model, provides a powerful method to evaluate important
   mechanical parameters of single, growing cells. Our findings indicate
   that the cell wall of growing pollen tubes has mechanical properties
   similar to rubber. This suggests that a fully turgid pollen tube is a
   relatively stiff, yet flexible cell that can react very quickly to
   obstacles or attractants by adjusting the direction of growth on its way
   through the female transmitting tissue.}},

Title = {{Impacts of urbanisation on biodiversity: the role of species mobility,
   degree of specialisation and spatial scale}},

Abstract = {{Urbanisation has an important impact on biodiversity, mostly driving
   changes in species assemblages, through the replacement of specialist
   with generalist species, thus leading to biotic homogenisation. Mobility
   is also assumed to greatly affect species' ability to cope in urban
   environments. Moreover, specialisation, mobility and their interaction
   are expected to greatly influence ecological processes such as
   metacommunity dynamics and assembly processes, and consequently the way
   and the spatial scale at which organisms respond to urbanisation. Here
   we investigate urbanisation impacts on distinct characteristics of
   species assemblages - namely specialisation degree in resource use,
   mobility and number of species, classified according to both
   characteristics and their combination - for vascular plants, butterflies
   and birds, across a range of spatial scales (from 1 x 1 km plots to 5
   km-radius buffers around them).
   We found that the degree of specialisation, mobility and their
   interaction, greatly influenced species' responses to urbanisation, with
   highly mobile specialist species of all taxonomic groups being affected
   most. Two different patterns were found: for plants, urbanisation
   induced trait divergence by favouring highly mobile species with narrow
   habitat ranges. For birds and butterflies, however, it reduced the
   number of highly mobile specialist species, thus driving trait
   convergence. Mobile organisms, across and within taxonomic groups,
   tended to respond at larger spatial scales than those that are poorly
   mobile. These findings emphasize the need to take into consideration
   species' ecological aspects, as well as a wide range of spatial scales
   when evaluating the impact of urbanisation on biodiversity. Our results
   also highlight the harmful impact of widespread urban expansion on
   organisms such as butterflies, especially highly mobile specialists,
   which were negatively affected by urban areas even at great distances.}},

Abstract = {{Floral volatiles are complex, multi-functional signals that are often
   used by pollinators in combination with other signals, such as color.
   Floral visitors use floral scent to estimate the amount of reward
   present in flowers, to facilitate the identification of a specific host
   flower or as signals that chemically resemble those important for
   pollinator insects in other ecological contexts. There is good evidence
   that floral scent evolves under selection imposed by both mutualists and
   antagonists. Antagonists may often limit the amount of scent emitted by
   flowers, thus contributing to spatial population variation, and select
   for phenotypic plasticity after enemy attack. Floral scent is also an
   important component of pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation, as it
   often co-varies with color and morphology in sister species with
   different pollination systems.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{The Last Glacial Maximum in the Alps lasted from approximately 30 to 19
   ka. Glaciers reached out onto the forelands on both sides of the main
   Alpine chains, forming piedmont lobes in the north and filling the
   Italian amphitheatres to the south. Pullback of glaciers from their
   maximum extent was underway by 24 ka. Glaciers oscillated at stillstand
   and minor re-advance positions for several thousand years forming Last
   Glacial Maximum (LGM) stadial moraines. North and south of the Alps, the
   various stadials cannot yet be unequivocally matched. Glaciers had
   receded back within the mountain front by 19-18 ka. During the early
   Lateglacial phase of ice decay remnants of the once huge valley glaciers
   that fed the piedmont lobes downwasted and were likely calving into the
   extensive lakes that formed in the lower valley reaches. The first
   Alpine-wide glacier re-advance took place during the Gschnitz stadial,
   17-16 ka, which was likely a response to Europe-wide cooling during
   Heinrich event 1. By the Bolling/Allerod interstadial much of the Alps
   were ice-free. Glaciers advanced repeatedly to an extent several
   kilometers from the cirque headwalls, during the Egesen stadial in
   response to the Younger Dryas cold period. Egesen stadial moraines, at
   some sites several sets of moraines, were constructed in valleys all
   across the Alps. 10Be exposure dates for Egesen stadial moraines are in
   the range 13.5 to 12 ka. Moraines located at an intermediate position
   between the Little Ice Age moraines and the Egesen moraines formed at
   the margins of glaciers that advanced during the closing phase of the
   Egesen stadial or during the earliest Holocene at 10.5 ka.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has emerged as a
   mode of communication between bacteria and plants. Although some
   bacterial VOCs that promote plant growth have been identified, their
   underlying mechanism of action is unknown. Here we demonstrate that
   indole, which was identified using a screen for Arabidopsis growth
   promotion by VOCs from soil-borne bacteria, is a potent plant-growth
   modulator. Its prominent role in increasing the plant secondary root
   network is mediated by interfering with the auxin-signalling machinery.
   Using auxin reporter lines and classic auxin physiological and transport
   assays we show that the indole signal invades the plant body, reaches
   zones of auxin activity and acts in a polar auxin transport-dependent
   bimodal mechanism to trigger differential cellular auxin responses. Our
   results suggest that indole, beyond its importance as a bacterial signal
   molecule, can serve as a remote messenger to manipulate plant growth and
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) decomposes on centennial timescale in
   soils, but the processes regulating its decay are poorly understood. We
   conducted one of the first studies of PyOM and wood decomposition in a
   temperate forest using isotopically labeled organic substrate, and
   quantified microbial incorporation and physico-chemical transformations
   of PyOM in situ. Stable-isotope (C-13 and N-15) enriched PyOM and its
   precursor wood were added to the soil at 2cm depth at ambient (N0) and
   increased (N+) levels of nitrogen fertilization. The carbon (C) and
   nitrogen (N) of added PyOM or wood were tracked through soil to 15cm
   depth, in physically separated soil density fractions and in benzene
   polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) molecular markers. After 10months in situ,
   more PyOM-derived C (>99\% of initial C-13-PyOM) and N (90\% of initial
   N-15-PyOM) was recovered than wood derived C (48\% of C-13-wood) and N
   (89\% under N0 and 48\% under N+). PyOM-C and wood-C migrated at the
   rate of 126mmyr(-1) with 3-4\% of PyOM-C and 4-8\% of wood-C recovered
   below the application depth. Most PyOM C was recovered in the free light
   fraction (fLF) (74\%), with 20\% in aggregate-occluded and 6\% in
   mineral associated fractions - fractions that typically have much slower
   turnover times. In contrast, wood C was recovered mainly in occluded
   (33\%) or dense fraction (27\%). PyOM addition induced loss of native C
   from soil (priming effect), particularly in fLF (13\%). The total BPCA-C
   content did not change but after 10months the degree of aromatic
   condensation of PyOM decreased, as determined by relative contribution
   of benzene hexa-carboxylic acid (B6CA) to the total BPCA C. Soil
   microbial biomass assimilated 6-10\% of C from the wood, while PyOM
   contributions was negligible (0.14-0.18\%). The addition of N had no
   effect on the dynamics of PyOM while limited effect on wood.}},

Journal = {{PALEOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{75-94}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Mollusks in general and ammonoids in particular are known to display a
   sometimes profound morphological intraspecific variability of their
   shell. Although this phenomenon is of greatest importance, it has rarely
   been investigated and quantified. It is especially crucial for taxonomy
   and incidentally for biodiversity analyses to account for it, because
   otherwise, the number of described species might exceed that of actual
   species within any group. Early ammonoids (Early Devonian, Paleozoic)
   typically suffer from this bias. For instance, most specimens from the
   same layer and the same region (e.g., the Erbenoceras beds of the
   Moroccan eastern Anti-Atlas studied here) differ morphologically from
   each other. Depending on the importance given to certain morphological
   characters, therefore, one could create a new species for almost every
   specimen. In this study, we measured nearly 100 such specimens from a
   restricted stratigraphic interval and quantified their intraspecific
   variability. There is a variable but strong overlap of the quantified
   shell characters at most ontogenetic stages, and only two species are
   here separated rather than the four previously recognized in Morocco.
   When ontogenetic trajectories of the Moroccan specimens are compared
   with coeval faunas from other regions (assigned to other species), a
   strong overlap between the morphospaces occupied by these taxa becomes
   apparent. The justification of some of these latter species is thus
   questionable even if their mean values in some conch parameters differ
   considerably from the mean values of the Moroccan species. Hence, the
   number of currently valid species of these loosely coiled early
   ammonoids is probably much too high. Extreme caution must therefore be
   taken when examining the diversity of groups in which the intraspecific
   variability is poorly known.}},

Abstract = {{Root hairs are known to be highly important for uptake of sparingly
   soluble nutrients, particularly in nutrient deficient soils. Development
   of increasingly sophisticated mathematical models has allowed uptake
   characteristics to be quantified. However, modelling has been
   constrained by a lack of methods for imaging live root hairs growing in
   real soils. We developed a plant growth protocol and used Synchrotron
   Radiation X-ray Tomographic Microscopy (SRXTM) to uncover the
   three-dimensional (3D) interactions of root hairs in real soil. We
   developed a model of phosphate uptake by root hairs based directly on
   the geometry of hairs and associated soil pores as revealed by imaging.
   Previous modelling studies found that root hairs dominate phosphate
   uptake. By contrast, our study suggests that hairs and roots contribute
   equally. We show that uptake by hairs is more localized than by roots
   and strongly dependent on root hair and aggregate orientation. The
   ability to image hairsoil interactions enables a step change in
   modelling approaches, allowing a more realistic treatment of processes
   at the scale of individual root hairs in soil pores.}},

Abstract = {{Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs) is the radiation flux emitted
   from chlorophyll molecules and can be used as a remote sensing (RS)
   observable to be linked to plant photosynthesis. Recently, significant
   progress has been made to quantify Fs from RS data, but both retrieval
   and interpretation of Fs remain challenging. In the case of airborne
   sensors with a medium spectral resolution (<2-4 nm), Fs is typically
   estimated using the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) approach focusing on
   atmospheric O-2 absorption bands. Most critical for accurate Fs
   retrievals based on such methods is the characterization of atmospheric
   scattering and absorption processes during data acquisition. So far,
   detailed experimental evidence on the retrieval accuracy of airborne
   measured Fs is lacking. We performed an experiment using a low-flying
   aircraft equipped with a non-imaging spectrometer acquiring medium
   spectral resolution data during the course of one day, using a
   repeat-track approach with changing flight altitudes. Fs in the near
   infrared was retrieved using a semi-empirical approach constraining the
   FLD based Fs retrieval from the O-2-A absorption band at 760 nm by using
   non-fluorescent surfaces. We used a-local sensitivity analysis to assess
   Fs retrieval biases related to observational and atmospheric parameters.
   Our results demonstrate a reliable Fs retrieval from airborne data using
   reference surfaces and indicate the need for accurate knowledge of
   atmospheric scattering and absorption processes. This study contributes
   to an estimation of the total error budget of Fs retrievals and will
   serve as a practical guideline for Fs retrieval schemes to be applied to
   medium resolution airborne spectroscopy data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Aim It is hypothesized that the ecological niches of polyploids should
   be both distinct and broader than those of diploids - characteristics
   that might have allowed the successful colonization of open habitats by
   polyploids during the Pleistocene glacial cycles. Here, we test these
   hypotheses by quantifying and comparing the ecological niches and niche
   breadths of a group of European primroses. Location Europe. Methods We
   gathered georeferenced data of four related species in Primula sect.
   Aleuritia at different ploidy levels (diploid, tetraploid, hexaploid and
   octoploid) and used seven bioclimatic variables to quantify niche
   overlap between species by applying a series of univariate and
   multivariate analyses combined with modelling techniques. We also
   employed permutation-based tests to evaluate niche similarity between
   the four species. Niche breadth for each species was evaluated both in
   the multivariate environmental space and in geographical space. Results
   The four species differed significantly from each other in
   mono-dimensional comparisons of climatological variables and occupied
   distinct habitats in the multi-dimensional environmental space. The
   majority of the permutation-based tests either indicated that the four
   species differed significantly in their habitat preferences and
   ecological niches or did not support significant niche similarity.
   Furthermore, our results revealed narrower niche breadths and
   geographical ranges in species of P. sect. Aleuritia at higher ploidy
   levels. Main conclusions The detected ecological differentiation between
   the four species of P. sect. Aleuritia at different ploidy levels is
   consistent with the hypothesis that polyploids occupy distinct
   ecological niches that differ from those of their diploid relative.
   Contrary to expectations, we find that polyploid species of P. sect.
   Aleuritia occupy narrower environmental and geographical spaces than
   their diploid relative. These results on the ecological niches of
   closely related polyploid and diploid species highlight factors that
   potentially contribute to the evolution and distribution of polyploid
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Access to improved sanitation is a key preventive measure against
   sanitary-related gastro-enteric diseases such as diarrhoea. We assessed
   the access to sanitation facilities and users' satisfaction in 50
   randomly selected slums of Kampala through a cross-sectional survey

   interviewed. Sixty-eight per cent of the respondents used shared
   toilets, 20\% private, 11\% public toilets and less than 1\% reported
   using flying toilets or practising open defecation. More than half of
   the respondents (51.7\%) were not satisfied with their sanitation
   facilities. Determinants for satisfaction with the facilities used
   included the nature and type of toilet facilities used, their
   cleanliness, and the number of families sharing them. The study findings
   showed that slum dwellers had high access to sanitation facilities.
   However, most of them were shared and majority of the respondents were
   not satisfied with their facilities, primarily due to cleanliness and
   over demand.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the problem of feature extraction for knowledge
   transfer between multiple remotely sensed images in the context of
   land-cover classification. Several factors such as illumination,
   atmospheric, and ground conditions cause radiometric differences between
   images of similar scenes acquired on different geographical areas or
   over the same scene but at different time instants. Accordingly, a
   change in the probability distributions of the classes is observed. The
   purpose of this work is to statistically align in the feature space an
   image of interest that still has to be classified (the target image) to
   another image whose ground truth is already available (the source
   image). Following a specifically designed feature extraction step
   applied to both images, we show that classifiers trained on the source
   image can successfully predict the classes of the target image despite
   the shift that has occurred. In this context, we analyze a recently
   proposed domain adaptation method aiming at reducing the distance
   between domains, Transfer Component Analysis, and assess the potential
   of its unsupervised and semisupervised implementations. In particular,
   with a dedicated study of its key additional objectives, namely the
   alignment of the projection with the labels and the preservation of the
   local data structures, we demonstrate the advantages of Semisupervised
   Transfer Component Analysis. We compare this approach with other both
   linear and kernel-based feature extraction techniques. Experiments on
   multi-and hyperspectral acquisitions show remarkable crossimage
   classification performances for the considered strategy, thus confirming
   its suitability when applied to remotely sensed images.}},

Abstract = {{A flurry of studies in recent years has analyzed the role of media in
   climate change communication. This article provides a systematic,
   large-scale, and up-to-date overview of the objects and characteristics
   of this research field through a meta-analysis. It identifies 133
   relevant studies and analyzes them empirically. The results show that
   research activity has risen strongly over time, and that the analytical
   spectrum has expanded to include an increasing number of countries, more
   types of media including online and social media, and different
   methodological approaches. The analysis also demonstrates, however, that
   scholarship in the field still concentrates strongly on Western
   countries and print media.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic climate change has triggered impacts on natural and human
   systems world-wide, yet the formal scientific method of detection and
   attribution has been only insufficiently described. Detection and
   attribution of impacts of climate change is a fundamentally
   cross-disciplinary issue, involving concepts, terms, and standards
   spanning the varied requirements of the various disciplines. Key
   problems for current assessments include the limited availability of
   long-term observations, the limited knowledge on processes and
   mechanisms involved in changing environmental systems, and the widely
   different concepts applied in the scientific literature. In order to
   facilitate current and future assessments, this paper describes the
   current conceptual framework of the field and outlines a number of
   conceptual challenges. Based on this, it proposes workable
   cross-disciplinary definitions, concepts, and standards. The paper is
   specifically intended to serve as a baseline for continued development
   of a consistent cross-disciplinary framework that will facilitate
   integrated assessment of the detection and attribution of climate change

Abstract = {{The discovery of the key role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in
   initiating innate immune responses and modulating adaptive immunity has
   revolutionized our understanding of vertebrate defence against
   pathogens. Yet, despite their central role in pathogen recognition and
   defence initiation, there is little information on how variation in TLRs
   influences disease susceptibility in natural populations. Here, we
   assessed the extent of naturally occurring polymorphisms at TLR2 in wild
   bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and tested for associations between TLR2
   variants and infection with Borrelia afzelii, a common tick-transmitted
   pathogen in rodents and one of the causative agents of human Lyme
   disease. Bank voles in our population had 15 different TLR2 haplotypes
   (10 different haplotypes at the amino acid level), which grouped in
   three well-separated clusters. In a large-scale capture-mark-recapture
   study, we show that voles carrying TLR2 haplotypes of one particular
   cluster (TLR2(c2)) were almost three times less likely to be Borrelia
   infected than animals carrying other haplotypes. Moreover, neutrality
   tests suggested that TLR2 has been under positive selection. This is, to
   our knowledge, the first demonstration of an association between TLR
   polymorphism and parasitism in wildlife, and a striking example that
   genetic variation at innate immune receptors can have a large impact on
   host resistance.}},

Title = {{Regulation of resource exchange in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis}},
Journal = {{NATURE PLANTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are one of the most important groups
   of plant symbionts. These fungi provide mineral nutrients to plants in
   exchange for carbon. Although substantial amounts of resources are
   exchanged, the factors that regulate trade in the AM symbiosis are
   poorly understood. Recent evidence for the reciprocally regulated
   exchange of resources by AM fungi and plants has led to the suggestion
   that these symbioses operate according to biological market dynamics, in
   which interactions are viewed from an economic perspective, and the most
   beneficial partners are favoured. Here we present five arguments that
   challenge the importance of reciprocally regulated exchange, and thereby
   market dynamics, for resource exchange in the AM symbiosis, and suggest
   that such reciprocity is only found in a subset of symbionts, under
   specific conditions. We instead propose that resource exchange in the AM
   symbiosis is determined by competition for surplus resources, functional
   diversity and sink strength.}},

Title = {{Plant adaptations to severely phosphorus-impoverished soils}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{23-31}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Mycorrhizas play a pivotal role in phosphorus (P) acquisition of plant
   roots, by enhancing the soil volume that can be explored.
   Non-mycorrhizal plant species typically occur either in relatively
   fertile soil or on soil with a very low P availability, where there is
   insufficient P in the soil solution for mycorrhizal hyphae to be
   effective. Soils with a very low P availability are either old and
   severely weathered or relatively young with high concentrations of
   oxides and hydroxides of aluminium and iron that sorb P. In such soils,
   cluster roots and other specialised roots that release P-mobilising
   carboxylates are more effective than mycorrhizas. Cluster roots are
   ephemeral structures that release carboxylates in an exudative burst.
   The carboxylates mobilise sparingly-available sources of soil P. The
   relative investment of biomass in cluster roots and the amount of
   carboxylates that are released during the exudative burst differ between
   species on severely weathered soils with a low total P concentration and
   species on young soils with high total P concentrations but low P
   availability. Taking a modelling approach, we explore how the optimal
   cluster-root strategy depends on soil characteristics, thus offering
   insights for plant breeders interested in developing crop plants with
   optimal cluster-root strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key plant hormone involved in diverse
   physiological and developmental processes, including abiotic stress
   responses and the regulation of stomatal aperture and seed germination.
   Abscisic acid glucosyl ester (ABA-GE) is a hydrolyzable ABA conjugate
   that accumulates in the vacuole and presumably also in the endoplasmic
   reticulum. Deconjugation of ABA-GE by the endoplasmic reticulum and
   vacuolar b-glucosidases allows the rapid formation of free ABA in
   response to abiotic stress conditions such as dehydration and salt
   stress. ABA-GE further contributes to the maintenance of ABA
   homeostasis, as it is the major ABA catabolite exported from the
   cytosol. In this work, we identified that the import of ABA-GE into
   vacuoles isolated from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mesophyll
   cells is mediated by two distinct membrane transport mechanisms: proton
   gradientdriven and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Both systems
   have similarKm values of approximately 1mM. According to our
   estimations, this low affinity appears nevertheless to be sufficient for
   the continuous vacuolar sequestration ofABA-GE produced in the cytosol.
   We further demonstrate that two tested multispecific vacuolar ABCC-type
   ABC transporters from Arabidopsis exhibit ABA-GE transport activity when
   expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which also supports the
   involvement of ABC transporters in ABA-GE uptake. Our findings suggest
   that the vacuolar ABA-GE uptake is not mediated by specific, but rather
   by several, possibly multispecific, transporters that are involved in
   the general vacuolar sequestration of conjugated metabolites.}},

Abstract = {{B chromosomes (Bs) are supernumerary chromosomes that vary in number
   among individuals of the same species. Because of their dispensable
   nature, their non-Mendelian inheritance and their origin from A
   chromosomes (As), one might assume that Bs followed a different
   evolutionary pathway from As, this being reflected in differences in
   their high-copy DNA constitution. We provide detailed insight into the
   composition and distribution of rye (Secale cereale) B-located high-copy
   sequences. A- and B-specific high-copy sequences were identified in
   silico. Mobile elements and satellite sequences were verified by
   fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Replication was analyzed via
   EdU incorporation. Although most repeats are similarly distributed along
   As and Bs, several transposons are either amplified or depleted on the
   B. An accumulation of B-enriched satellites was found mostly in the
   nondisjunction control region of the B, which is transcriptionally
   active and late-replicating. All B-enriched sequences are not unique to
   the B but are also present in other Secale species, suggesting the
   origin of the B from As of the same genus. Our findings highlight the
   differences between As and Bs. Although Bs originated from As, they have
   since taken a separate evolutionary pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Plant architecture is influenced by the polar, cell-to-cell transport of
   auxin that is primarily provided and regulated by plasma membrane efflux
   catalysts of the PIN-FORMED and B family of ABC transporter (ABCB)
   classes. The latter were shown to require the functionality of the FK506
   binding protein42 TWISTED DWARF1 (TWD1), although underlying mechanisms
   are unclear. By genetic manipulation of TWD1 expression, we show here
   that TWD1 affects shootward root auxin reflux and, thus, downstream
   developmental traits, such as epidermal twisting and gravitropism of the
   root. Using immunological assays, we demonstrate a predominant lateral,
   mainly outward-facing, plasma membrane location for TWD1 in the root
   epidermis characterized by the lateral marker ABC transporter
   G36/PLEIOTROPIC DRUG-RESISTANCE8/PENETRATION3. At these epidermal plasma
   membrane domains, TWD1 colocalizes with nonpolar ABCB1. In planta
   bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analysis was used to verify
   specific ABC transporter B1 (ABCB1)-TWD1 interaction. Our data support a
   model in which TWD1 promotes lateral ABCB-mediated auxin efflux via
   protein-protein interaction at the plasma membrane, minimizing reflux
   from the root apoplast into the cytoplasm.}},

Title = {{Analysis and visualisation of movement: an interdisciplinary review}},
Journal = {{MOVEMENT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The processes that cause and influence movement are one of the main
   points of enquiry in movement ecology. However, ecology is not the only
   discipline interested in movement: a number of information sciences are
   specialising in analysis and visualisation of movement data. The recent
   explosion in availability and complexity of movement data has resulted
   in a call in ecology for new appropriate methods that would be able to
   take full advantage of the increasingly complex and growing data volume.
   One way in which this could be done is to form interdisciplinary
   collaborations between ecologists and experts from information sciences
   that analyse movement. In this paper we present an overview of new
   movement analysis and visualisation methodologies resulting from such an
   interdisciplinary research network: the European COST Action ``MOVE -
   Knowledge Discovery from Moving Objects{''} (http://www.move-cost.info).
   This international network evolved over four years and brought together
   some 140 researchers from different disciplines: those that collect
   movement data (out of which the movement ecology was the largest
   represented group) and those that specialise in developing methods for
   analysis and visualisation of such data (represented in MOVE by
   computational geometry, geographic information science, visualisation
   and visual analytics). We present MOVE achievements and at the same time
   put them in ecological context by exploring relevant ecological themes
   to which MOVE studies do or potentially could contribute.}},

Title = {{Four decades of glacier variations at Muztagh Ata (eastern Pamir): a

Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2071-2088}},
Abstract = {{Previous in situ measurements have indicated a slight mass gain at
   Muztagh Ata in the eastern Pamir, contrary to the global trend. We
   extend these measurements both in space and time by using remote sensing
   data and present four decades of glacier variations in the entire
   mountain massif. Geodetic mass balances and area changes were determined
   at glacier scale from stereo satellite imagery and derived digital
   elevation models (DEMs). This includes Hexagon KH-9 (year 1973),
   ALOS-PRISM (2009), Pleiades (2013) and Landsat 7 ETM+ data in
   conjunction with the SRTM-3 DEM (2000). In addition, surface velocities
   of Kekesayi Glacier, the largest glacier at Muztagh Ata, were derived
   from amplitude tracking of TerraSAR-X images (2011). Locally, we
   observed strong spatial and temporal glacier variations during the last
   four decades, which were, however, on average not significant for the
   entire massif. Some south-west-exposed glaciers fluctuated or advanced,
   while glaciers with other aspects rather experienced continuous
   shrinkage. Several glaciers such as Kekesayi indicate no measurable
   change at their frontal position, but clear down-wasting despite mostly
   thick debris coverage at low altitudes. The surface velocity of this
   debris-covered glacier reach up to 20 cm per day, but the lowest part of
   the tongue appears to be stagnant. The low velocity or even stagnancy at
   the tongue is likely one reason for the down-wasting. On average, the
   glaciers showed a small, insignificant shrinkage from 274.3 +/- 10.6
   km(2) in 1973 to 272.7 +/- 1.0 km(2) in 2013 (-0.02 +/- 0.1\% a(-1)).
   Average mass changes in the range of 0.03 +/- 0.33mw. e. a(-1)
   (1973-2009) to 0.01 +/- 0.30mw. e. a(-1) (1973-2013) reveal nearly
   balanced budgets for the last 40 years. Indications of slightly positive
   rates after 1999 (+0.04 +/- 0.27mw. e. a(-1)) are not significant, but
   confirmed by measurements in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing rapid climate change is predicted to cause local extinction of
   plant species in mountain regions. However, some plant species could
   have persisted during Quaternary climate oscillations without shifting
   their range, despite the limited evidence from fossils. Here, we tested
   two candidate mechanisms of persistence by comparing the macrorefugia
   and microrefugia (MR) hypotheses. We used the rare and endemic Saxifraga
   florulenta as a model taxon and combined ensembles of species
   distribution models (SDMs) with a high-resolution paleoclimatic and
   topographic dataset to reconstruct its potential current and past
   distribution since the last glacial maximum. To test the macrorefugia
   hypothesis, we verified whether the species could have persisted in or
   shifted to geographic areas defined by its realized niche. We then
   identified potential MR based on climatic and topographic properties of
   the landscape and applied refined scenarios of MR dynamics and functions
   over time. Last, we quantified the number of known occurrences that
   could be explained by either the macrorefugia or MR model. A consensus
   of two or three SDM techniques predicted absence between 14-10, 3-4 and
   1 ka BP, which did not support the macrorefugia model. In contrast, we
   showed that S. florulenta could have contracted into MR during periods
   of absence predicted by the SDMs and later re-colonized suitable areas
   according to the macrorefugia model. Assuming a limited and realistic
   seed dispersal distance for our species, we explained a large number of
   the current occurrences (61-96\%). Additionally, we showed that MR could
   have facilitated range expansions or shifts of S. florulenta. Finally,
   we found that the most recent and the most stable MR were the ones
   closest to current occurrences. Hence, we propose a novel paradigm to
   explain plant persistence by highlighting the importance of supporting
   functions of MR when forecasting the fate of plant species under climate
   change.}},

Abstract = {{This article covers detailed characterization and naming of QSr.sun -
   5BL as Sr56 . Molecular markers linked with adult plant stem rust
   resistance gene Sr56 were identified and validated for marker-assisted
   selection.
   The identification of new sources of adult plant resistance (APR) and
   effective combinations of major and minor genes is well appreciated in
   breeding for durable rust resistance in wheat. A QTL, QSr.sun-5BL,
   contributed by winter wheat cultivar Arina providing 12-15 \% reduction
   in stem rust severity, was reported in an Arina/Forno recombinant inbred
   line (RIL) population. Following the demonstration of monogenic
   segregation for APR in the Arina/Yitpi RIL population, the resistance
   locus was formally named Sr56. Saturation mapping of the Sr56 region
   using STS (from EST and DArT clones), SNP (9 K) and SSR markers from
   wheat chromosome survey sequences that were ordered based on synteny
   with Brachypodium distachyon genes in chromosome 1 resulted in the
   flanking of Sr56 by sun209 (SSR) and sun320 (STS) at 2.6 and 1.2 cM on
   the proximal and distal ends, respectively. Investigation of
   conservation of gene order between the Sr56 region in wheat and B.
   distachyon showed that the syntenic region defined by SSR marker
   interval sun209-sun215 corresponded to approximately 192 kb in B.
   distachyon, which contains five predicted genes. Conservation of gene
   order for the Sr56 region between wheat and Brachypodium, except for two
   inversions, provides a starting point for future map-based cloning of
   Sr56. The Arina/Forno RILs carrying both Sr56 and Sr57 exhibited low
   disease severity compared to those RILs carrying these genes singly.
   Markers linked with Sr56 would be useful for marker-assisted pyramiding
   of this gene with other major and APR genes for which closely linked
   markers are available.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies assessing the role of biological diversity for ecosystem
   functioning indicate that the diversity of functional traits and the
   evolutionary history of species in a community, not the number of
   taxonomic units, ultimately drives the biodiversity-ecosystem-function
   relationship. Here, we simultaneously assessed the importance of plant
   functional trait and phylogenetic diversity as predictors of major
   trophic groups of soil biota (abundance and diversity), six years from
   the onset of a grassland biodiversity experiment. Plant functional and
   phylogenetic diversity were generally better predictors of soil biota
   than the traditionally used species or functional group richness.
   Functional diversity was a reliable predictor for most biota, with the
   exception of soil microorganisms, which were better predicted by
   phylogenetic diversity. These results provide empirical support for the
   idea that the diversity of plant functional traits and the diversity of
   evolutionary lineages in a community are important for maintaining
   higher abundances and diversity of soil communities.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element in all living organisms, but is
   toxic in excess. Several plant species are able to accumulate Zn at
   extraordinarily high concentrations in the leaf epidermis without
   showing any toxicity symptoms. However, the molecular mechanisms of this
   phenomenon are still poorly understood. A state-of-the-art quantitative
   2D liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS)
   proteomics approach was used to investigate the abundance of proteins
   involved in Zn hyperaccumulation in leaf epidermal and mesophyll tissues
   of Noccaea caerulescens. Furthermore, the Zn speciation in planta was
   analyzed by a size-exclusion chromatography/inductively coupled plasma
   mass spectrometer (SEC-ICP-MS) method, in order to identify the
   Zn-binding ligands and mechanisms responsible for Zn hyperaccumulation.
   Epidermal cells have an increased capability to cope with the oxidative
   stress that results from excess Zn, as indicated by a higher abundance
   of glutathione S-transferase proteins. A Zn importer of the ZIP family
   was more abundant in the epidermal tissue than in the mesophyll tissue,
   but the vacuolar Zn transporter MTP1 was equally distributed. Almost all
   of the Zn located in the mesophyll was stored as Zn-nicotianamine
   complexes. In contrast, a much lower proportion of the Zn was found as
   Zn-nicotianamine complexes in the epidermis. However, these cells have
   higher concentrations of malate and citrate, and these organic acids are
   probably responsible for complexation of most epidermal Zn. Here we
   provide evidence for a cell type-specific adaptation to excess Zn
   conditions and an increased ability to transport Zn into the epidermal
   vacuoles.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a data set of daily, 1 km resolution Greenland ice
   sheet (GrIS) surface mass balance (SMB) covering the period 1958-2015.
   Applying corrections for elevation, bare ice albedo and accumulation
   bias, the high-resolution product is statistically downscaled from the
   native daily output of the polar regional climate model RACMO2.3 at 11
   km. The data set includes all individual SMB components projected to a
   down-sampled version of the Greenland Ice Mapping Project (GIMP) digital
   elevation model and ice mask. The 1 km mask better resolves narrow
   ablation zones, valley glaciers, fjords and disconnected ice caps.
   Relative to the 11 km product, the more detailed representation of
   isolated glaciated areas leads to increased precipitation over the
   southeastern GrIS. In addition, the downscaled product shows a
   significant increase in runoff owing to better resolved low-lying
   marginal glaciated regions. The combined corrections for elevation and
   bare ice albedo markedly improve model agreement with a newly compiled
   data set of ablation measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm8 derived from rye is located on a
   1BL.1RS chromosome translocation in wheat. However, some wheat lines
   with this translocation do not show resistance to isolates of the wheat
   powdery mildew pathogen avirulent to Pm8 due to an unknown genetically
   dominant suppression mechanism. Here we show that lines with suppressed
   Pm8 activity contain an intact and expressed Pm8 gene. Therefore, the
   absence of Pm8 function in certain 1BL.1RS-containing wheat lines is not
   the result of gene loss or mutation but is based on suppression. The
   wheat gene Pm3, an ortholog of rye Pm8, suppressed Pm8-mediated powdery
   mildew resistance in lines containing Pm8 in a transient single-cell
   expression assay. This result was further confirmed in transgenic lines
   with combined Pm8 and Pm3 transgenes. Expression analysis revealed that
   suppression is not the result of gene silencing, either in wheat 1BL.1RS
   translocation lines carrying Pm8 or in transgenic genotypes with both
   Pm8 and Pm3 alleles. In addition, a similar abundance of the PM8 and PM3
   proteins in single or double homozygous transgenic lines suggested that
   a post-translational mechanism is involved in suppression of Pm8.
   Co-expression of Pm8 and Pm3 genes in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves
   followed by co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the two proteins
   interact. Therefore, the formation of a heteromeric protein complex
   might result in inefficient or absent signal transmission for the
   defense reaction. These data provide a molecular explanation for the
   suppression of resistance genes in certain genetic backgrounds and
   suggest ways to circumvent it in future plant breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorophyll (Chl) degradation causes leaf yellowing during senescence or
   under stress conditions. For Chl breakdown, STAY-GREEN1 (SGR1) interacts
   with Chl catabolic enzymes (CCEs) and light-harvesting complex II
   (LHCII) at the thylakoid membrane, possibly to allow metabolic
   channeling of potentially phototoxic Chl breakdown intermediates. Among
   these Chl catabolic components, SGR1 acts as a key regulator of leaf
   yellowing. In addition to SGR1 (At4g22920), the Arabidopsis thaliana
   genome contains an additional homolog, SGR2 (At4g11910), whose
   biological function remains elusive. Under senescence-inducing
   conditions, SGR2 expression is highly up-regulated, similarly to SGR1
   expression. Here we show that SGR2 function counteracts SGR1 activity in
   leaf Chl degradation; SGR2-overexpressing plants stayed green and the
   sgr2-1 knockout mutant exhibited early leaf yellowing under age-, dark-,
   and stress-induced senescence conditions. Like SGR1, SGR2 interacted
   with LHCII but, in contrast to SGR1, SGR2 interactions with CCEs were
   very limited. Furthermore, SGR1 and SGR2 formed homo- or heterodimers,
   strongly suggesting a role for SGR2 in negatively regulating Chl
   degradation by possibly interfering with the proposed CCE-recruiting
   function of SGR1. Our data indicate an antagonistic evolution of the
   functions of SGR1 and SGR2 in Arabidopsis to balance Chl catabolism in
   chloroplasts with the dismantling and remobilizing of other cellular
   components in senescing leaf cells.}},

Abstract = {{The exceptional species diversity of flowering plants, exceeding that of
   their sister group more than 250-fold, is especially evident in floral
   innovations, interactions with pollinators and sexual systems. Multiple
   theories, emphasizing flower-pollinator interactions, genetic effects of
   mating systems or high evolvability, predict that floral evolution
   profoundly affects angiosperm diversification. However, consequences for
   speciation and extinction dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we
   investigate trajectories of species diversification focusing on
   heterostyly, a remarkable floral syndrome where outcrossing is enforced
   via cross-compatible floral morphs differing in placement of their
   respective sexual organs. Heterostyly evolved at least 20 times
   independently in angiosperms. Using Darwin's model for heterostyly, the
   primrose family, we show that heterostyly accelerates species
   diversification via decreasing extinction rates rather than increasing
   speciation rates, probably owing to avoidance of the negative genetic
   effects of selfing. However, impact of heterostyly appears to differ
   over short and long evolutionary time-scales: the accelerating effect of
   heterostyly on lineage diversification is manifest only over long
   evolutionary time-scales, whereas recent losses of heterostyly may
   prompt ephemeral bursts of speciation. Our results suggest that temporal
   or clade-specific conditions may ultimately determine the net effects of
   specific traits on patterns of species diversification.}},

Abstract = {{N2O is a potent greenhouse gas involved in the destruction of the
   protective ozone layer in the stratosphere and contributing to global
   warming. The ecological processes regulating its emissions from soil are
   still poorly understood. Here, we show that the presence of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a dominant group of soil fungi, which form
   symbiotic associations with the majority of land plants and which
   influence a range of important ecosystem functions, can induce a
   reduction in N2O emissions from soil. To test for a functional
   relationship between AMF and N2O emissions, we manipulated the abundance
   of AMF in two independent greenhouse experiments using two different
   approaches (sterilized and re-inoculated soil and non-mycorrhizal tomato
   mutants) and two different soils. N2O emissions were increased by 42 and
   33\% in microcosms with reduced AMF abundance compared to microcosms
   with a well-established AMF community, suggesting that AMF regulate N2O
   emissions. This could partly be explained by increased N immobilization
   into microbial or plant biomass, reduced concentrations of mineral soil
   N as a substrate for N2O emission and altered water relations. Moreover,
   the abundance of key genes responsible for N2O production (nirK) was
   negatively and for N2O consumption (nosZ) positively correlated to AMF
   abundance, indicating that the regulation of N2O emissions is
   transmitted by AMF-induced changes in the soil microbial community. Our
   results suggest that the disruption of the AMF symbiosis through
   intensification of agricultural practices may further contribute to
   increased N2O emissions.}},

Title = {{Integrating Early Cretaceous Fossils into the Phylogeny of Living
   Angiosperms: ANITA Lines and Relatives of Chloranthaceae}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{175}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{555-600}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Premise of research. Discoveries of fossil flowers in Cretaceous rocks
   offer improved evidence for relationships with living clades, but for
   more secure inferences formal phylogenetic analyses are desirable. We
   extend previous analyses of magnoliids, monocots, and basal eudicots to
   Aptian, Albian, and Cenomanian fossils related to the basal ``ANITA{''}
   lines and Chloranthaceae.
   Methodology. We performed parsimony analyses of a morphological data set
   of Recent angiosperms and published fossils, with the arrangement of
   Recent taxa constrained to backbone trees based primarily on molecular
   data.
   Pivotal results. Not only Monetianthus (as previously inferred) but also
   Carpestella is nested within Nymphaeaceae, while Pluricarpellatia may be
   a stem relative of Cabombaceae or Nymphaeaceae. Anacostia (with
   Similipollis pollen) is nested within Austrobaileyales. The position of
   Couperites (with Clavatipollenites pollen) is ambiguous: it may be on
   the stem lineage of Chloranthaceae (and Ceratophyllum, if this extant
   aquatic is related to Chloranthaceae), nested in Chloranthaceae, or more
   basal. Plants with Asteropollis pollen and reduced tepals are related to
   the chloranthaceous genus Hedyosmum. Zlatkocarpus, which also has a
   reduced perianth, may be either a stem relative or a crown group member
   of Chloranthaceae. Plants that produced loosely reticulate Pennipollis
   pollen are more likely related to Chloranthaceae and/or Ceratophyllum
   than to monocots. We confirm that Canrightia, with bisexual flowers and
   a reduced perianth, is a stem relative of Chloranthaceae. Despite
   similarities to Piperales, Appomattoxia (with Tucanopollis pollen) is
   more likely near the base of the ANITA grade or related to
   Chloranthaceae and/or Ceratophyllum.
   Conclusions. The Cretaceous rise of angiosperms involved the radiation
   not only of magnoliids, eudicots, and monocots but also of basal ANITA
   lines, including both aquatic Nymphaeales and woody groups. Our results
   reaffirm the early diversity of Chloranthaceae and clarify their floral
   evolution, in which a shift to unisexual flowers preceded loss of the
   perianth.}},

Abstract = {{Proteins with nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat
   (LRR) domains are major components of the plant immune system. They
   usually mediate resistance against a subgroup of races of a specific
   pathogen. For the allelic series of the wheat powdery mildew resistance
   gene Pm3, alleles with a broad and a narrow resistance spectrum have
   been described. Here, we show that a broad Pm3 spectrum range correlates
   with a fast and intense hypersensitive response (HR) in a Nicotiana
   transient-expression system and this activity can be attributed to two
   particular amino acids in the ARC2 subdomain of the NBS. The combined
   substitution of these amino acids in narrow-spectrum PM3 proteins
   enhances their capacity to induce an HR in Nicotiana benthamiana, and we
   demonstrate that these substitutions also enlarge the resistance
   spectrum of the Pm3f allele in wheat. Finally, using Bph14, we show that
   the region carrying the relevant amino acids also plays a role in the HR
   regulation of another coiled-coil NBS-LRR resistance protein. These
   results highlight the importance of an optimized NBS-'molecular switch'
   for the conversion of initial pathogen perception by the LRR into
   resistance-protein activation, and we describe a possible approach to
   extend the effectiveness of resistance genes via minimal targeted
   modifications in the NBS domain.}},

Title = {{Predicting invasion in grassland ecosystems: is exotic dominance the

Abstract = {{Invasions have increased the size of regional species pools, but are
   typically assumed to reduce native diversity. However, global-scale
   tests of this assumption have been elusive because of the focus on
   exotic species richness, rather than relative abundance. This is
   problematic because low invader richness can indicate invasion
   resistance by the native community or, alternatively, dominance by a
   single exotic species. Here, we used a globally replicated study to
   quantify relationships between exotic richness and abundance in
   grass-dominated ecosystems in 13 countries on six continents, ranging
   from salt marshes to alpine tundra. We tested effects of human land use,
   native community diversity, herbivore pressure, and nutrient limitation
   on exotic plant dominance. Despite its widespread use, exotic richness
   was a poor proxy for exotic dominance at low exotic richness, because
   sites that contained few exotic species ranged from relatively pristine
   (low exotic richness and cover) to almost completely exotic-dominated
   ones (low exotic richness but high exotic cover). Both exotic cover and
   richness were predicted by native plant diversity (native grass
   richness) and land use (distance to cultivation). Although climate was
   important for predicting both exotic cover and richness, climatic
   factors predicting cover (precipitation variability) differed from those
   predicting richness (maximum temperature and mean temperature in the
   wettest quarter). Herbivory and nutrient limitation did not predict
   exotic richness or cover. Exotic dominance was greatest in areas with
   low native grass richness at the site- or regional-scale. Although this
   could reflect native grass displacement, a lack of biotic resistance is
   a more likely explanation, given that grasses comprise the most
   aggressive invaders. These findings underscore the need to move beyond
   richness as a surrogate for the extent of invasion, because this metric
   confounds monodominance with invasion resistance. Monitoring species'
   relative abundance will more rapidly advance our understanding of
   invasions.}},

Abstract = {{Extracting 3D tree models based on terrestrial laser scanning (TLS)
   point clouds is a challenging task as trees are complex objects. Current
   TLS devices acquire high-density data that allow a detailed
   reconstruction of the tree topology. However, in dense forests a fully
   automatic reconstruction of trees is often limited by occlusion, wind
   influences and co-registration issues. In this paper, a semi-automatic
   method for extracting branching and stem structure based on
   equirectangular projections (range and intensity maps) is presented. The
   digitization of branches and stems is based on 2D maps, which enables
   simple navigation and raster processing. The modeling is performed for
   each viewpoint individually instead of using a registered point cloud.
   Previously reconstructed 2D-skeletons are transformed between the maps.
   Therefore, wind influences, orientation imperfections of scans and data
   gaps can be overcome. The method is applied to a TLS dataset acquired in
   a forest in Germany. In total 34 scans were carried out within a managed
   forest to measure approximately 90 spruce trees with minimal occlusions.
   The results demonstrate the feasibility of the presented approach to
   extract tree models with a high completeness and correctness and provide
   an excellent input for further modeling applications.}},

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1465-1472}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Although Bergmann's rule - stating that among closely related species,
   the bigger ones will inhabit the colder climates/higher latitudes - was
   formulated for inter-specific comparisons, most analyses that tested
   this pattern in mammals were on an intra-specific level. To date, no
   large-scale taxonomy-driven cross-species evaluation of the pattern
   predicted by Bergmann exists. Here we show, in a dataset comprising 3561
   mammal species from 26 orders, that while there is no significant
   correlation between latitude and body mass using conventional methods,
   this correlation is highly significant when the phylogenetic structure
   of the dataset is accounted for, thus supporting Bergmann's claim that
   the rule only applies to closely related species. Analyses of different
   subsets indicate that the Bergmann's rule is evident across a variety of
   latitude ranges. In many taxonomic subsets, when analysed alone, there
   is no significant correlation between body mass and latitude. In
   combination with both the significant relationship in the overall
   dataset and with results of intra-specific analyses from the literature,
   this suggests that Bergmann's rule describes a fundamental principle
   within mammals, but that its expression has been modified by a variety
   of factors during mammalian diversification yet to be resolved.}},

Abstract = {{Methylotrophic planktonic bacteria fulfill a particular role in the
   carbon cycle of lakes via the turnover of single-carbon compounds. We
   studied two planktonic freshwater lineages (LD28 and PRD01a001B)
   affiliated with Methylophilaceae (Betaproteobacteria) in Lake Zurich,
   Switzerland, by a combination of molecular and cultivation-based
   approaches. Their spatio-temporal distribution was monitored at high
   resolution (n=992 samples) for 4 consecutive years. LD28 methylotrophs
   constituted up to 11 x 10(7) cells l(-1) with pronounced peaks in spring
   and autumn-winter, concomitant with blooms of primary producers. They
   were rare in the warm water layers during summer but abundant in the
   cold hypolimnion, hinting at psychrophilic growth. Members of the
   PRD01a001B lineage were generally less abundant but also had maxima in
   spring. More than 120 axenic strains from these so far uncultivated
   lineages were isolated from the pelagic zone by dilution to extinction.
   Phylogenetic analysis separated isolates into two distinct genotypes.
   Isolates grew slowly (mu(max)=0.4 d(-1)), were of conspicuously small
   size, and were indeed psychrophilic, with higher growth yield at low
   temperatures. Growth was enhanced upon addition of methanol and
   methylamine to sterile lake water. Genomic analyses of two strains
   confirmed a methylotrophic lifestyle with a reduced set of genes
   involved in C1 metabolism. The very small and streamlined genomes (1.36
   and 1.75 Mb) shared several pathways with the marine OM43 lineage. As
   the closest described taxa (Methylotenera sp.) are only distantly
   related to either set of isolates, we propose a new genus with two
   species, that is, `Candidatus Methylopumilus planktonicus' (LD28) and `
   Candidatus Methylopumilus turicensis' (PRD01a001B).}},

Abstract = {{Selling has evolved in animals, fungi, and plants, and since Darwin's
   pioneering study, it is considered one of the most frequent evolutionary
   trends in flowering plants. Generally, the evolution of selling is
   characterized by a loss of self-incompatibility, the selfing syndrome,
   and changes in genome-wide polymorphism patterns. Recent
   interdisciplinary studies involving molecular functional experiments,
   genome-wide data, experimental evolution, and evolutionary ecology using
   Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorbabditis elegans, and other species show
   that the evolution of selfing is not merely a degradation of crossing
   traits but a model for studying the recurrent patterns underlying
   adaptive molecular evolution. For example, in wild Arabidopsis
   relatives, self-compatibility evolved from mutations in the male
   specificity gene S.-LOCUS CYSTELNE-RICH PROTETN/S-LOCUS PROTEIN 11
   (VS/VM, rather than the female specificity gene, S-LOUS' RECEPTOR KINASE
   (SRK), supporting the theoretical prediction of sexual asymmetry.
   Prevalence of dominant self-compatible mutations is consistent with
   Haldane's sieve, which acts against recessive adaptive mutations. Time
   estimates based on genome-wide polymorph isms and self-incompatibility
   genes generally support the recent origin of selling.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with lightweight spectral
   sensors facilitate non-destructive, near-real-time vegetation analysis.
   In order to guarantee robust scientific analysis, data acquisition
   protocols and processing methodologies need to be developed and new
   sensors must be compared with state-of-the-art instruments. Four
   different types of optical UAV-based sensors (RGB camera, converted
   near-infrared camera, six-band multispectral camera and high spectral
   resolution spectrometer) were deployed and compared in order to evaluate
   their applicability for vegetation monitoring with a focus on precision
   agricultural applications. Data were collected in New Zealand over
   ryegrass pastures of various conditions and compared to ground spectral
   measurements. The UAV STS spectrometer and the multispectral camera MCA6
   (Multiple Camera Array) were found to deliver spectral data that can
   match the spectral measurements of an ASD at ground level when compared
   over all waypoints (UAV STS: R-2 = 0.98; MCA6: R-2 = 0.92). Variability
   was highest in the near-infrared bands for both sensors while the band
   multispectral camera also overestimated the green peak reflectance.
   Reflectance factors derived from the RGB (R-2 = 0.63) and converted
   near-infrared (R-2 = 0.65) cameras resulted in lower accordance with
   reference measurements. The UAV spectrometer system is capable of
   providing narrow-band information for crop and pasture management. The
   six-band multispectral camera has the potential to be deployed to target
   specific broad wavebands if shortcomings in radiometric limitations can
   be addressed. Large-scale imaging of pasture variability can be achieved
   by either using a true colour or a modified near-infrared camera. Data
   quality from UAV-based sensors can only be assured, if field protocols
   are followed and environmental conditions allow for stable platform
   behaviour and illumination.}},

Abstract = {{Phonology and syntax represent two layers of sound combination central
   to language's expressive power. Comparative animal studies represent one
   approach to understand the origins of these combinatorial layers.
   Traditionally, phonology, where meaningless sounds form words, has been
   considered a simpler combination than syntax, and thus should be more
   common in animals. A linguistically informed review of animal call
   sequences demonstrates that phonology in animal vocal systems is rare,
   whereas syntax is more widespread. In the light of this and the absence
   of phonology in some languages, we hypothesize that syntax, present in
   all languages, evolved before phonology.}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) are toxic to all living organisms,
   including plants and humans. In plants, Cd and As are detoxified by
   phytochelatins (PCs) and metal(loid)-chelating peptides and by
   sequestering PC-metal(loid) complexes in vacuoles. Consistent
   differences have been observed between As and Cd detoxification. Whereas
   chelation of Cd by PCs is largely sufficient to detoxify Cd, As-PC
   complexes must be sequestered into vacuoles to be fully detoxified. It
   is not clear whether this difference in detoxification pathways is
   ubiquitous among plants or varies across species. Here, we have
   conducted a PC transport study using vacuoles isolated from Arabidopsis
   and barley. Arabidopsis vacuoles accumulated low levels of PC2-Cd, and
   vesicles from yeast cells expressing either AtABCC1 or AtABCC2 exhibited
   negligible PC2-Cd transport activity compared with PC2-As. In contrast,
   barley vacuoles readily accumulated comparable levels of PC2-Cd and
   PC2-As. PC transport in barley vacuoles was inhibited by vanadate, but
   not by ammonium, suggesting the involvement of ABC-type transporters.
   Interestingly, barley vacuoles exhibited enhanced PC2 transport activity
   when essential metal ions, such as Zn(II), Cu(II) and Mn(II), were added
   to the transport assay, suggesting that PCs might contribute to the
   homeostasis of essential metals and detoxification of non-essential
   toxic metal(loid)s.}},

Title = {{Intercomparison of fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active
   radiation products derived from satellite data over Europe}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{141-154}},
Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) is
   recognized as an essential climate variable (ECVs), playing a critical
   role in the estimation of the global energy and carbon balance. With
   multiple space-borne remote sensing FAPAR global products available from
   several sources the need for continual comparison and validation has
   become imperative. In this study, the performance of three global FAPAR
   algorithms (JRC-TIP, ESA/JRC MGVI and Boston University FAPAR) was
   evaluated over Europe for the year 2011. Results show an overall
   agreement among FAPAR products on sites having high and low FAPAR
   values, except for the north-eastern region of Europe characterized by
   boreal forest and the transition region with tundra biomes, where the
   Boston product exceeds values in other products by up to 0.5.
   Differences in FAPAR estimates over forest biomes suggest that
   assumptions on structure and optical properties of land surfaces in the
   different radiative transfer models play an important role in
   remote-sensing-derived FAPAR products. Uncertainty assessments were
   carried out using both quality indicators as proposed by the individual
   product teams as well as independent theoretical uncertainty estimates
   obtained with the triple collocation error model. The former revealed
   consistent spatial patterns but large differences in magnitudes (up to
   0.1) with systematically lower uncertainties for the Boston product The
   latter instead suggests similar uncertainty ranges among the three
   products. Finally, a comparison with ground estimates for the 2009-2011
   period over four European flux tower sites showed consistent, plausible
   seasonal variations of remote-sensing-derived FAPAR products. Findings
   suggest that differences in absolute values and inconsistency in
   uncertainty representation among FAPAR products are still considerable.
   Standardization frameworks quantifying the impact of different radiative
   transfer formulations on the estimation of biophysical variables,
   independent uncertainty estimation methods and well-defined ground
   measurement protocols need to be put in place before FAPAR products can
   be reliably fed into existing biogeochemical process models. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Plant functional characteristics may drive plant species richness
   effects on ecosystem processes. Consequently, the focus of
   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiments has expanded from
   the manipulation of plant species richness to manipulating functional
   trait composition. Involving ecophysiological plant traits in the
   experimental design might allow for a better understanding of how
   species loss alters ecosystem processes. Here we provide the theoretical
   background, design and first results of the `Trait-Based Biodiversity
   Experiment' (TBE), established in 2010 that directly manipulates the
   trait composition of experimental plant communities.
   Analysis of six plant traits related to resource acquisition and use
   were analyzed using principal component analysis of 60 grassland
   species. The resulting two main axes describe gradients in functional
   similarity, and were used as the basis for designing plant communities
   with different functional and species diversity levels. Using such an
   approach allowed us to manipulate different levels of complementarity in
   spatial and temporal plant resource acquisition. In contrast to previous
   biodiversity experiments, the TBE is designed according to more
   realistic scenarios of non-random species loss along orthogonal axes of
   species trait dissimilarities. This allows us to tease apart the
   relative importance of selection and complementarity effects on multiple
   ecosystem processes, and to mechanistically study the consequences of
   plant community simplification.}},

Title = {{Effects of drought and N-fertilization on N cycling in two grassland

Abstract = {{Changes in frequency and intensity of drought events are anticipated in
   many areas of the world. In pasture, drought effects on soil nitrogen
   (N) cycling are spatially and temporally heterogeneous due to N
   redistribution by grazers. We studied soil N cycling responses to
   simulated summer drought and N deposition by grazers in a 3-year field
   experiment replicated in two grasslands differing in climate and
   management. Cattle urine and NH4NO3 application increased soil NH4 (+)
   and NO3 (-) concentrations, and more so under drought due to reduced
   plant uptake and reduced nitrification and denitrification. Drought
   effects were, however, reflected to a minor extent only in potential
   nitrification, denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA), and the abundance of
   functional genes characteristic of nitrifying (bacterial and archaeal
   amoA) and denitrifying (narG, nirS, nirK, nosZ) micro-organisms. N2O
   emissions, however, were much reduced under drought, suggesting that
   this effect was driven by environmental limitations rather than by
   changes in the activity potential or the size of the respective
   microbial communities. Cattle urine stimulated nitrification and, to a
   lesser extent, also DEA, but more so in the absence of drought. In
   contrast, NH4NO3 reduced the activity of nitrifiers and denitrifiers due
   to top-soil acidification. In summary, our data demonstrate that complex
   interactions between drought, mineral N availability, soil
   acidification, and plant nutrient uptake control soil N cycling and
   associated N2O emissions. These interactive effects differed between
   processes of the soil N cycle, suggesting that the spatial heterogeneity
   in pastures needs to be taken into account when predicting changes in N
   cycling and associated N2O emissions in a changing climate.}},

Title = {{High sensitivity of tidewater outlet glacier dynamics to shape}},
Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1007-1015}},
Abstract = {{Variability in tidewater outlet glacier behavior under similar external
   forcing has been attributed to differences in outlet shape (i.e., bed
   elevation and width), but this dependence has not been investigated in
   detail. Here we use a numerical ice flow model to show that the dynamics
   of tidewater outlet glaciers under external forcing are highly sensitive
   to width and bed topography. Our sensitivity tests indicate that for
   glaciers with similar discharge, the trunks of wider glaciers and those
   grounded over deeper basal depressions tend to be closer to flotation,
   so that less dynamically induced thinning results in rapid, unstable
   retreat following a perturbation. The lag time between the onset of the
   perturbation and unstable retreat varies with outlet shape, which may
   help explain intra-regional variability in tidewater outlet glacier
   behavior. Further, because the perturbation response is dependent on the
   thickness relative to flotation, varying the bed topography within the
   range of observational uncertainty can result in either stable or
   unstable retreat due to the same perturbation. Thus, extreme care must
   be taken when interpreting the future behavior of actual glacier systems
   using numerical ice flow models that are not accompanied by
   comprehensive sensitivity analyses.}},

Title = {{Variability and evolution of global land surface phenology over the past

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring land surface phenology (LSP) is important for understanding
   both the responses and feedbacks of ecosystems to the climate system,
   and for representing these accurately in terrestrial biosphere models.
   Moreover, by shedding light on phenological trends at a variety of
   scales, LSP provides the potential to fill the gap between traditional
   phenological (field) observations and the large-scale view of global
   models. In this study, we review and evaluate the variability and
   evolution of satellite-derived growing season length (GSL) globally and
   over the past three decades. We used the longest continuous record of
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data available to date at global
   scale to derive LSP metrics consistently over all vegetated land areas
   and for the period 1982-2012. We tested GSL, start- and end-of-season
   metrics (SOS and EOS, respectively) for linear trends as well as for
   significant trend shifts over the study period. We evaluated trends
   using global environmental stratification information in place of
   commonly used land cover maps to avoid circular findings. Our results
   confirmed an average lengthening of the growing season globally during
   1982-2012 - averaging 0.22-0.34daysyr(-1), but with spatially
   heterogeneous trends. About 13-19\% of global land areas displayed
   significant GSL change, and over 30\% of trends occurred in the
   boreal/alpine biome of the Northern Hemisphere, which showed diverging
   GSL evolution over the past three decades. Within this biome, the Cold
   and Mesic' environmental zone appeared as an LSP change hotspot. We also
   examined the relative contribution of SOS and EOS to the overall
   changes, finding that EOS trends were generally stronger and more
   prevalent than SOS trends. These findings constitute a step towards the
   identification of large-scale phenological drivers of vegetated land
   surfaces, necessary for improving phenological representation in
   terrestrial biosphere models.}},

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Unprecedented bark beetle outbreaks have been observed for a variety of
   forest ecosystems recently, and damage is expected to further intensify
   as a consequence of climate change. In Central Europe, the response of
   ecosystem management to increasing infestation risk has hitherto focused
   largely on the stand level, while the contingency of outbreak dynamics
   on large-scale drivers remains poorly understood. To investigate how
   factors beyond the local scale contribute to the infestation risk from
   Ips typographus (Col., Scol.), we analysed drivers across seven orders
   of magnitude in scale (from 10(3) to 10(10)m(2)) over a 23-year period,
   focusing on the Bavarian Forest National Park. Time-discrete hazard
   modelling was used to account for local factors and temporal
   dependencies. Subsequently, beta regression was applied to determine the
   influence of regional and landscape factors, the latter characterized by
   means of graph theory. We found that in addition to stand variables,
   large-scale drivers also strongly influenced bark beetle infestation
   risk. Outbreak waves were closely related to landscape-scale
   connectedness of both host and beetle populations as well as to regional
   bark beetle infestation levels. Furthermore, regional summer drought was
   identified as an important trigger for infestation pulses. Large-scale
   synchrony and connectivity are thus key drivers of the recently observed
   bark beetle outbreak in the area.Synthesis and applications. Our
   multiscale analysis provides evidence that the risk for biotic
   disturbances is highly dependent on drivers beyond the control of
   traditional stand-scale management. This finding highlights the
   importance of fostering the ability to cope with and recover from
   disturbance. It furthermore suggests that a stronger consideration of
   landscape and regional processes is needed to address changing
   disturbance regimes in ecosystem management.

Abstract = {{In cereals, several mildew resistance genes occur as large allelic
   series; for example, in wheat (Triticum aestivum and Triticum turgidum),
   17 functional Pm3 alleles confer agronomically important race-specific
   resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis). The molecular basis of
   race specificity has been characterized in wheat, but little is known
   about the corresponding avirulence genes in powdery mildew. Here, we
   dissected the genetics of avirulence for six Pm3 alleles and found that
   three major Avr loci affect avirulence, with a common locus\_1 involved
   in all AvrPm3-Pm3 interactions. We cloned the effector gene
   AvrPm3(a2/f2) from locus\_2, which is recognized by the Pm3a and Pm3f
   alleles. Induction of a Pm3 allele-dependent hypersensitive response in
   transient assays in Nicotiana benthamiana and in wheat demonstrated
   specificity. Gene expression analysis of Bcg1 (encoded by locus\_1) and
   AvrPm3(a2/f2) revealed significant differences between isolates,
   indicating that in addition to protein polymorphisms, expression levels
   play a role in avirulence. We propose a model for race specificity
   involving three components: an allele-specific avirulence effector, a
   resistance gene allele, and a pathogen-encoded suppressor of avirulence.
   Thus, whereas a genetically simple allelic series controls specificity
   in the plant host, recognition on the pathogen side is more complex,
   allowing flexible evolutionary responses and adaptation to resistance
   genes.}},

Abstract = {{A significant fraction of carbon stored in the Earth's soil moves
   through arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and ectomycorrhiza (EM). The impacts
   of AM and EM on the soil carbon budget are poorly understood. We propose
   a method to quantify the mycorrhizal contribution to carbon cycling,
   explicitly accounting for the abundance of plant-associated and
   extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium. We discuss the need to acquire
   additional data to use our method, and present our new global database
   holding information on plant species-by-site intensity of root
   colonization by mycorrhizas. We demonstrate that the degree of
   mycorrhizal fungal colonization has globally consistent patterns across
   plant species. This suggests that the level of plant species-specific
   root colonization can be used as a plant trait. To exemplify our method,
   we assessed the differential impacts of AM:EM ratio and EM shrub
   encroachment on carbon stocks in sub-arctic tundra. AM and EM affect
   tundra carbon stocks at different magnitudes, and via partly distinct
   dominant pathways: via extraradical mycelium (both EM and AM) and via
   mycorrhizal impacts on above- and belowground biomass carbon (mostly
   AM). Our method provides a powerful tool for the quantitative assessment
   of mycorrhizal impact on local and global carbon cycling processes,
   paving the way towards an improved understanding of the role of
   mycorrhizas in the Earth's carbon cycle.}},

Abstract = {{As quantitative or spatially distributed studies of environmental change
   over truly long-term periods of more than 100 years are extremely rare,
   we re-photographed 361 landscapes that appear on historical photographs
   (1868-1994) within a 40,000 km(2) study area in northern Ethiopia.
   Visible evidence of environmental changes apparent from the paired
   photographs was analyzed using an expert rating system. The conditions
   of the woody vegetation, soil and water conservation structures and land
   management were worse in the earlier periods compared to their present
   conditions. The cover by indigenous trees is a notable exception: it
   peaked in the 1930s, declined afterwards and then achieved a second peak
   in the early 21st century. Particularly in areas with greater population
   densities, there has been a significant increase in woody vegetation and
   soil and water conservation structures over the course of the study
   period. We conclude that except for an apparent upward movement of the
   upper tree limit, the direct human impacts on the environment are
   overriding the effects of climate change in the north Ethiopian
   highlands and that the northern Ethiopian highlands are currently
   greener than at any other time in the last 145 years. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Can current moisture responses predict soil CO2 efflux under altered
   precipitation regimes? A synthesis of manipulation experiments}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2991-3013}},
Abstract = {{As a key component of the carbon cycle, soil CO2 efflux (SCE) is being
   increasingly studied to improve our mechanistic understanding of this
   important carbon flux. Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change
   often depends on extrapolation of current relationships between
   ecosystem processes and their climatic drivers to conditions not yet
   experienced by the ecosystem. This raises the question of to what extent
   these relationships remain unaltered beyond the current climatic window
   for which observations are available to constrain the relationships.
   Here, we evaluate whether current responses of SCE to fluctuations in
   soil temperature and soil water content can be used to predict SCE under
   altered rainfall patterns. Of the 58 experiments for which we gathered
   SCE data, 20 were discarded because either too few data were available
   or inconsistencies precluded their incorporation in the analyses. The 38
   remaining experiments were used to test the hypothesis that a model
   parameterized with data from the control plots (using soil temperature
   and water content as predictor variables) could adequately predict SCE
   measured in the manipulated treatment. Only for 7 of these 38
   experiments was this hypothesis rejected. Importantly, these were the
   experiments with the most reliable data sets, i.e., those providing
   high-frequency measurements of SCE. Regression tree analysis
   demonstrated that our hypothesis could be rejected only for experiments
   with measurement intervals of less than 11 days, and was not rejected
   for any of the 24 experiments with larger measurement intervals. This
   highlights the importance of high-frequency measurements when studying
   effects of altered precipitation on SCE, probably because infrequent
   measurement schemes have insufficient capacity to detect shifts in the
   climate dependencies of SCE. Hence, the most justified answer to the
   question of whether current moisture responses of SCE can be
   extrapolated to predict SCE under altered precipitation regimes is `no'
   - as based on the most reliable data sets available. We strongly
   recommend that future experiments focus more strongly on establishing
   response functions across a broader range of precipitation regimes and
   soil moisture conditions. Such experiments should make accurate
   measurements of water availability, should conduct high-frequency SCE
   measurements, and should consider both instantaneous responses and the
   potential legacy effects of climate extremes. This is important, because
   with the novel approach presented here, we demonstrated that, at least
   for some ecosystems, current moisture responses could not be
   extrapolated to predict SCE under altered rainfall conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Community-level mass flowering, known as general flowering, which occurs
   in South-East Asia at supra-annual irregular intervals, is considered a
   particularly spectacular phenomenon in tropical ecology. Recent studies
   have proposed several proximate factors inducing general flowering, such
   as drought and falls in minimum temperature. However, limited empirical
   data on the developmental and physiological processes have been
   available to test the significance of such factors. To overcome this
   limitation and test the hypotheses that general flowering is triggered
   by the proposed factors, we conducted an ecological transcriptome' study
   of a mass flowering species, Shorea beccariana, comparing meteorological
   data with genome-wide expression patterns obtained using next-generation
   sequencing. Among the 98 flowering-related genes identified, the
   homologs of a floral pathway integrator, SbFT, and a floral repressor,
   SbSVP, showed dramatic transcriptional changes before flowering, and
   their flowering functions were confirmed using transgenic Arabidopsis
   thaliana. Expression in drought-responsive and sucrose-induced genes
   also changed before flowering. All these expression changes occurred
   when the flowering-inducing level of drought was reached, as estimated
   using data from the preceding 10years. These genome-wide expression data
   support the hypothesis that drought is a trigger for general flowering.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing of long-term vegetation monitoring relies on the analysis
   of multisensor and multitemporal time-series measurements. Cross-sensor
   calibration is therefore important to prevent artifacts in the temporal
   signal due to inherent differences in sensors configurations. Variations
   in spectral response functions (SRFs) are among the major causes of
   differences in multisensor reflectances and products. In this paper, we
   report on the SRF comparability of the upcoming Sentinel-2 Multispectral
   Instrument (MSI) sensor with a number of operational sensors National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Advanced Very High
   Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR9), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
   (ETM+), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre VEGETATION1 (VGT1),
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Medium
   Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) relevant for vegetation
   monitoring. SRF cross-sensor calibration methods for the conversion of
   red and near infrared (NIR) reflectances and Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) values of operational sensors in reference to
   the Sentinel-2 MSI sensor were evaluated. Calibration data sets obtained
   using the soil-leaf-canopy radiative transfer model; a state-of-the-art
   airborne imaging spectrometer Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX); and
   univariate and multivariate regression models were considered for SRF
   cross-sensor calibration. For AVHRR9 and VGT1, reflectances in the red
   spectral region differed more than 30\% from Sentinel-2 reflectances.
   These differences translated in NDVI deviations of up to 10\%. The
   developed SRF cross-sensor calibration method reduced the differences by
   factors up to 6, 3, and 7 for red, NIR, and NDVI values, respectively.
   All but AVHRR9 have been found to be cross-calibrated to within 5\%
   differences for reflectances and NDVI values. The present work is
   considered as part of a broader harmonization effort aimed at preparing
   for the integration of Sentinel-2 MSI data with existing historical data
   records and product time series.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, extended-spectrum R-lactamase (ESBL)-producing
   Escherichia colt isolates recovered from the following sources were
   characterized with regard to the occurrence and distribution of
   uropathogenic and enteric pathogenic virulence factors: surface waters
   (rivers and lakes, n = 60), the intestines of freshwater fish (n 33),
   fresh vegetables (n 26), retail poultry meat (n 13) and the fecal
   samples of livestock (n 28), healthy humans (n 34) and primary care
   patients (n 13). Among the 207 isolates, 82\% tested positive by PCR for
   one or more of the virulence factors (VI) that predict uropathogenicity,
   TraT, fyuA, chuA, PAL yfcv or vat. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) were
   detected in each of the analyzed sources. Regarding virulence factors
   for intestinal pathogenic E colt, these were found more rarely and
   predominantly associated with the aquatic environment, with aagR (EAEC)
   found in isolates from surface waters and STp (porcine heat stable
   enterotoxin) and LT (heat-labile enterotoxin) associated with isolates
   from fish. Aggregate VF scores (the number of unique virulence factors
   detected for each isolate) were lowest among isolates belonging to
   phylogenetic group B1 and highest among group B2. Clustering of the
   isolates by phylogenetic group, multilocus sequence type (MLST) and
   ESBL-types revealed clonal overlaps of A:ST10(CTX-M-1) and
   D:ST350(CTX-M-1) between the sources of livestock, poultry meat and
   healthy humans, suggesting livestock, in particular poultry, represents
   a potential reservoir for these particular UPEC clones. The clones
   A:ST10(CTX-M-55) and B2:ST131(CTX-M-27), harboring uropathogenic
   virulence factors were significantly associated with fresh vegetables
   and with fish, respectively. Further clonal complexes with source
   overlaps included D:ST38(CTX-M-14), D:ST69(CTX-M-15), D:ST405(CTX-M-15)
   and D:ST648(CTX-M-15), which were found in surface water and healthy
   humans. Identifying potential reservoirs of OPEC in the environment,
   animals, food and humans is important in order to assess routes of
   transmission and risk factors for acquiring OPEC. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Several studies have shown that satellite retrievals of solar-induced
   chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provide useful information on terrestrial
   photosynthesis or gross primary production (GPP). Here, we have
   incorporated equations coupling SIF to photosynthesis in a land surface
   model, the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Land Model
   version 4 (NCAR CLM4), and have demonstrated its use as a diagnostic
   tool for evaluating the calculation of photosynthesis, a key process in
   a land surface model that strongly influences the carbon, water, and
   energy cycles. By comparing forward simulations of SIF, essentially as a
   byproduct of photosynthesis, in CLM4 with observations of actual SIF, it
   is possible to check whether the model is accurately representing
   photosynthesis and the processes coupled to it. We provide some
   background on how SIF is coupled to photosynthesis, describe how SIF was
   incorporated into CLM4, and demonstrate that our simulated relationship
   between SIF and GPP values are reasonable when compared with satellite
   (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite; GOSAT) and in situ flux-tower
   measurements. CLM4 overestimates SIF in tropical forests, and we show
   that this error can be corrected by adjusting the maximum carboxylation
   rate (V-max) specified for tropical forests in CLM4. Our study confirms
   that SIF has the potential to improve photosynthesis simulation and
   thereby can play a critical role in improving land surface and carbon
   cycle models.}},

Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{313-326}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Recent developments in phylogenetic methods have made it possible to
   reconstruct evolutionary radiations from extant taxa, but identifying
   the triggers of radiations is still problematic. Here, we propose a
   conceptual framework to explore the role of variables that may impact
   radiations. We classify the variables into extrinsic conditions vs
   intrinsic traits, whether they provide background conditions, trigger
   the radiation, or modulate the radiation. We used three clades
   representing angiosperm phylogenetic and structural diversity
   (Ericaceae, Fagales and Poales) as test groups. We located radiation
   events, selected variables potentially associated with diversification,
   and inferred the temporal sequences of evolution. We found 13 shifts in
   diversification regimes in the three clades. We classified the
   associated variables, and determined whether they originated before the
   relevant radiation (backgrounds), originated simultaneously with the
   radiations (triggers), or evolved later (modulators). By applying this
   conceptual framework, we establish that radiations require both
   extrinsic conditions and intrinsic traits, but that the sequence of
   these is not important. We also show that diversification drivers can be
   detected by being more variable within a radiation than conserved traits
   that only allow occupation of a new habitat. This framework facilitates
   exploration of the causative factors of evolutionary radiations.}},

Title = {{Stochastic integrated assessment of climate tipping points indicates the
   need for strict climate policy}},
Journal = {{NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{441-444}},

Abstract = {{Perhaps the most `dangerous' aspect of future climate change is the
   possibility that human activities will push parts of the climate system
   past tipping points, leading to irreversible impacts(1). The likelihood
   of such large-scale singular events(2) is expected to increase with
   global warming(1-3), but is fundamentally uncertain(4). A key question
   is how should the uncertainty surrounding tipping events(1,5) affect
   climate policy? We address this using a stochastic integrated assessment
   model(6), based on the widely used deterministic DICE model(7). The
   temperature-dependent likelihood of tipping is calibrated using expert
   opinions(3), which we find to be internally consistent. The irreversible
   impacts of tipping events are assumed to accumulate steadily over time
   (rather than instantaneously(8-11)), consistent with scientific
   understanding(1,5). Even with conservative assumptions about the rate
   and impacts of a stochastic tipping event, today's optimal carbon tax is
   increased by similar to 50\%. For a plausibly rapid, high-impact tipping
   event, today's optimal carbon tax is increased by >200\%. The additional
   carbon tax to delay climate tipping grows at only about half the rate of
   the baseline carbon tax. This implies that the effective discount rate
   for the costs of stochastic climate tipping is much lower than the
   discount rate(7,12,13) for deterministic climate damages. Our results
   support recent suggestions that the costs of carbon emission used to
   inform policy(12,13) are being underestimated(14-16), and that uncertain
   future climate damages should be discounted at a low rate(17-20).}},

Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{229-243}},
Abstract = {{Information on snow depth and its spatial distribution is crucial for
   numerous applications in snow and avalanche research as well as in
   hydrology and ecology. Today, snow depth distributions are usually
   estimated using point measurements performed by automated weather
   stations and observers in the field combined with interpolation
   algorithms. However, these methodologies are not able to capture the
   high spatial variability of the snow depth distribution present in
   alpine terrain. Continuous and accurate snow depth mapping has been
   successfully performed using laser scanning but this method can only
   cover limited areas and is expensive. We use the airborne ADS80
   optoelectronic scanner, acquiring stereo imagery with 0.25m spatial
   resolution to derive digital surface models (DSMs) of winter and summer
   terrains in the neighborhood of Davos, Switzerland. The DSMs are
   generated using photogrammetric image correlation techniques based on
   the multispectral nadir and backward-looking sensor data. In order to
   assess the accuracy of the photogrammetric products, we compare these
   products with the following independent data sets acquired
   simultaneously: (a) manually measured snow depth plots; (b) differential
   Global Navigation Satellite System (dGNSS) points; (c) terrestrial laser
   scanning (TLS); and (d) ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data sets. We
   demonstrate that the method presented can be used to map snow depth at
   2m resolution with a vertical depth accuracy of +/- 30 cm (root mean
   square error) in the complex topography of the Alps. The snow depth maps
   presented have an average accuracy that is better than 15\% compared to
   the average snow depth of 2.2m over the entire test site.}},

Title = {{Agricultural practices indirectly influence plant productivity and

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1842-1853}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that agricultural practices alter the composition
   and diversity of soil microbial communities. However, the impact of
   changing soil microbial communities on the functioning of the
   agroecosystems is still poorly understood. Earlier work showed that soil
   tillage drastically altered microbial community composition. Here we
   tested, using an experimental grassland (Lolium, Trifolium, Plantago) as
   a model system, whether soil microbial communities from conventionally
   tilled (CT) and non-tilled (NT) soils have different influences on plant
   productivity and nutrient acquisition. We specifically focus on
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), as they are a group of beneficial
   soil fungi that can promote plant productivity and ecosystem functioning
   and are also strongly affected by tillage management.
   Soil microbial communities from CT and NT soils varied greatly in their
   effects on the grassland communities. Communities from CT soil increased
   overall biomass production more than soil communities from NT soil. This
   effect was mainly due to a significant growth promotion of Trifolium by
   CT microorganisms. In contrast to CT soil inoculum, NT soil inoculum
   increased plant phosphorus concentration and total plant P content,
   demonstrating that the soil microbial communities from NT fields enhance
   P uptake. Differences in AM fungal community composition resulting, for
   instance, in twofold greater hyphal length in NT soil communities when
   compared to CT, are the most likely explanation for the different plant
   responses to CT and NT soil inocula.
   A range of field studies have shown that plant P uptake increases when
   farmers change to conservation tillage or direct seeding. Our results
   indicate that this enhanced P uptake results from enhanced hyphal length
   and an altered AM fungal community. Our results further demonstrate that
   agricultural management practices indirectly influence ecosystem
   services and plant community structure through effects on soil biota.}},

Title = {{Invertebrate herbivory increases along an experimental gradient of

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{174}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{183-193}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Plant diversity is a key driver of ecosystem functioning best documented
   for its influence on plant productivity. The strength and direction of
   plant diversity effects on species interactions across trophic levels
   are less clear. For example, with respect to the interactions between
   herbivorous invertebrates and plants, a number of competing hypotheses
   have been proposed that predict either increasing or decreasing
   community herbivory with increasing plant species richness. We
   investigated foliar herbivory rates and consumed leaf biomass along an
   experimental grassland plant diversity gradient in year eight after
   establishment. The gradient ranged from one to 60 plant species and
   manipulated also functional group richness (from one to four functional
   groups-legumes, grasses, small herbs, and tall herbs) and plant
   community composition. Measurements in monocultures of each plant
   species showed that functional groups differed in the quantity and
   quality of herbivory damage they experienced, with legumes being more
   damaged than grasses or non-legume herbs. In mixed plant communities,
   herbivory increased with plant diversity and the presence of two key
   plant functional groups in mixtures had a positive (legumes) and a
   negative (grasses) effect on levels of herbivory. Further, plant
   community biomass had a strong positive impact on consumed leaf biomass,
   but little effect on herbivory rates. Our results contribute detailed
   data from a well-established biodiversity experiment to a growing body
   of evidence suggesting that an increase of herbivory with increasing
   plant diversity is the rule rather than an exception. Considering
   documented effects of herbivory on other ecosystem functions and the
   increase of herbivory with plant diversity, levels of herbivory damage
   might not only be a result, but also a trigger within the
   diversity-productivity relationship.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the use of cytogenomic and molecular approaches
   to explore the origin and evolution of Cardamine schulzii, a textbook
   example of a recent allopolyploid, in its similar to 110-year history of
   human-induced hybridization and allopolyploidy in the Swiss Alps.
   Triploids are typically viewed as bridges between diploids and
   tetraploids but rarely as parental genomes of high-level hybrids and
   polyploids. The genome of the triploid semifertile hybrid Cardamine 3
   insueta (2n = 24, RRA) was shown to combine the parental genomes of two
   diploid (2n = 2x = 16) species, Cardamine amara (AA) and Cardamine
   rivularis (RR). These parental genomes have remained structurally stable
   within the triploid genome over the > 100 years since its origin.
   Furthermore, we provide compelling evidence that the alleged recent
   polyploid C. schulzii is not an autohexaploid derivative of C. x
   insueta. Instead, at least two hybridization events involving C. x
   insueta and the hypotetraploid Cardamine pratensis (PPPP, 2n = 4x-2 =
   30) have resulted in the origin of the trigenomic hypopentaploid (2n =
   5x22 = 38, PPRRA) and hypohexaploid (2n = 6x-2 = 46, PPPPRA). These data
   show that the semifertile triploid hybrid can promote a merger of three
   different genomes and demonstrate how important it is to reexamine the
   routinely repeated textbook examples using modern techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The water discharge from the heavily glacierized Sary-Jaz River Basin
   (Eastern Kyrgyzstan) is of high importance for the very arid Tarim Basin
   located in Xinjiang (north-western China). We investigated glacier
   changes in the entire Sary-Jaz River Basin, which covers a large part of
   the Central Tien Shan, for the period from 1990 to 2010 based on Landsat
   TM'/ETM+'data. We found 1310 glaciers (>0.1km(2)), which covered 2055
   +/- 41.1 km(2) (approximate to 18\% of the entire basin) in 1990. The
   glaciers shrank by 77.1 +/- 57.1 km(2) (3.7 +/- 2.7\%) until 2010. This
   is considerably lower than in most other ranges of the Tien Shan. The
   lowest insignificant area loss (-1.5 +/- 2.7\%) was found in the eastern
   part of the basin where the largest glaciers and highest peaks are
   situated. Debris-covered glaciers shrank significantly less than
   clean-ice glaciers of comparable size. We also identified a few
   advancing glaciers which show surge characteristics. Climate data from
   the Tien Shan weather station (3614m asl.) close to the study region
   showed no significant long-term trend.}},

Abstract = {{A widespread loss of glacier area and volume has been observed in the
   European Alps since the 1980s. In addition to differences among various
   regions of the Alps, different responses to climate change characterize
   neighboring glaciers within the same region. In this study we describe
   the glacier changes in the Ortles-Cevedale group, the largest
   glacierized area in the Italian Alps. We analyze the spatial
   variability, the drivers, and the main factors controlling the current
   loss of ice in this region, by comparing mean elevation changes derived
   from two digital terrain models (DTMs), along with glacier extents and
   snow-covered areas derived from Landsat images acquired in 1987 and
   2009, to various topographic factors. Glacier outlines were obtained
   using the band ratio method with manual corrections. Snow was classified
   from a near-infrared image after topographic correction. The total
   glacierized area shrank by 23.4 +/- 3\% in this period, with no
   significant changes in the mean altitude of the glaciers. In 2009 the
   snowline was 240 m higher than in the 1960s and 1970s. From the
   snow-covered area at the end of summer 2009, which fairly represents the
   extent and local variability of the accumulation areas in the 2000s, we
   estimate that approximately 50\% of the remaining glacier surfaces have
   to melt away to re-establish balanced mass budgets with present climatic
   conditions. The average geodetic mass budget rate, calculated for 112
   ice bodies by differencing two DTMs, ranged from -0.18 +/- 0.04 to -1.43
   +/- 0.09 m w.e. a(-1), averaging -0.69 +/- 0.12 m w.e. a(-1). The
   correlation analysis of mass budgets vs. topographic variables
   emphasized the important role of hypsometry in controlling the area and
   volume loss of larger glaciers, whereas a higher variability
   characterizes smaller glaciers, which is likely due to the higher
   importance of local topo-climatic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Snow accumulation is an important component of the mass balance of
   alpine glaciers. To improve our understanding of the processes related
   to accumulation and their representation in state-of-the-art
   mass-balance models, extensive field measurements are required. We
   present measurements of snow accumulation distribution on
   Findelengletscher, Switzerland, for April 2010 using (1) in situ snow
   probings, (2) airborne ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and (3)
   differencing of two airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) digital
   elevation models (DEMs). Calculating high-resolution snow depth from
   DEM-differencing requires careful correction for vertical ice-flow
   velocity and densification in the accumulation area. All three methods
   reveal a general increase in snow depth with elevation, but also a
   significant small-scale spatial variability. Lidar-differencing and in
   situ snow probings show good agreement for the mean specific winter
   balance (0.72 and 0.78 m w.e., respectively). The lidar-derived
   distributed snow depth reveals significant zonal correlations with
   elevation, slope and curvature in a multiple linear regression model.
   Unlike lidar-differencing, GPR-derived snow depth is not affected by
   glacier dynamics or firn compaction, but to a smaller degree by snow
   density and liquid water content. It is thus a valuable independent data
   source for validation. The simultaneous availability of the three
   datasets facilitates the comparison of the methods and contributes to a
   better understanding of processes that govern winter accumulation
   distribution on alpine glaciers.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial species belonging to the genus Burkholderia have been
   repeatedly reported to be associated with fungi but the extent and
   specificity of these associations in soils remain undetermined. To
   assess whether associations between Burkholderia and fungi are
   widespread in soils, we performed a co-occurrence analysis in an
   intercontinental soil sample collection. This revealed that Burkholderia
   significantly co-occurred with a wide range of fungi. To analyse the
   molecular basis of the interaction, we selected two model fungi
   frequently co-occurring with Burkholderia, Alternaria alternata and
   Fusarium solani, and analysed the proteome changes caused by cultivation
   with either fungus in the widespread soil inhabitant B. glathei, whose
   genome we sequenced. Co-cultivation with both fungi led to very similar
   changes in the B. glathei proteome. Our results indicate that B. glathei
   significantly benefits from the interaction, which is exemplified by a
   lower abundance of several starvation factors that were highly expressed
   in pure culture. However, co-cultivation also gave rise to stress
   factors, as indicated by the increased expression of multidrug efflux
   pumps and proteins involved in oxidative stress response. Our data
   suggest that the ability of Burkholderia to establish a close
   association with fungi mainly lies in the capacities to utilize
   fungal-secreted metabolites and to overcome fungal defense mechanisms.
   This work indicates that beneficial interactions with fungi might
   contribute to the survival strategy of Burkholderia species in
   environments with sub-optimal conditions, including acidic soils.}},

Title = {{The potential for snow to supply human water demand in the present and
   future}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Runoff from snowmelt is regarded as a vital water source for people and
   ecosystems throughout the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Numerous studies
   point to the threat global warming poses to the timing and magnitude of
   snow accumulation and melt. But analyses focused on snow supply do not
   show where changes to snowmelt runoff are likely to present the most
   pressing adaptation challenges, given sub-annual patterns of human water
   consumption and water availability from rainfall. We identify the NH
   basins where present spring and summer snowmelt has the greatest
   potential to supply the human water demand that would otherwise be unmet
   by instantaneous rainfall runoff. Using a multi-model ensemble of
   climate change projections, we find that these basins-which together
   have a present population of similar to 2 billion people-are exposed to
   a 67\% risk of decreased snow supply this coming century. Further, in
   the multi-model mean, 68 basins (with a present population of >300
   million people) transition from having sufficient rainfall runoff to
   meet all present human water demand to having insufficient rainfall
   runoff. However, internal climate variability creates irreducible
   uncertainty in the projected future trends in snow resource potential,
   with about 90\% of snow-sensitive basins showing potential for either
   increases or decreases over the near-term decades. Our results emphasize
   the importance of snow for fulfilling human water demand in many NH
   basins, and highlight the need to account for the full range of internal
   climate variability in developing robust climate risk management
   decisions.}},

   investigate the effect of biochar on root architecture under field
   conditions in a tropical setting.
   The presented work describes a shovelomics (i.e., description of root
   traits in the field) study on the effect of biochar on maize root
   architecture. Four field experiments we carried out at two different
   locations in Zambia, exhibiting non-fertile to relatively fertile soils.
   Roots of maize crop (Zea mays L.) were sampled from treatments with
   fertilizer (control) and with a combination of fertilizer and 4 t.ha(-1)
   maize biochar application incorporated in the soil.
   For the four sites, the average grain yield increase upon biochar
   addition was 45 +/- 14 \% relative to the fertilized control (from
   2.1-6.0 to 3.1-9.1 ton ha(-1)). The root biomass was approximately twice
   as large for biochar-amended plots. More extensive root systems
   (especially characterized by a larger root opening angle (+14 +/- 11 \%)
   and wider root systems (+20 +/- 15 \%)) were observed at all
   biochar-amended sites. Root systems exhibited significantly higher
   specific surface areas (+54 +/- 14 \%), branching and fine roots: +70
   +/- 56 \%) in the presence of biochar.
   Biochar amendment resulted in more developed root systems and larger
   yields. The more extensive root systems may have contributed to the
   observed yield increases, e.g., by improving immobile nutrients uptake
   in soils that are unfertile or in areas with prolonged dry spells.}},

Abstract = {{Plant functional traits, in particular specific leaf area (SLA), wood
   density and seed mass, are often good predictors of individual tree
   growth rates within communities. Individuals and species with high SLA,
   low wood density and small seeds tend to have faster growth rates. If
   community-level relationships between traits and growth have general
   predictive value, then similar relationships should also be observed in
   analyses that integrate across taxa, biogeographic regions and
   environments. Such global consistency would imply that traits could
   serve as valuable proxies for the complex suite of factors that
   determine growth rate, and, therefore, could underpin a new generation
   of robust dynamic vegetation models. Alternatively, growth rates may
   depend more strongly on the local environment or growth-trait
   relationships may vary along environmental gradients. We tested these
   alternative hypotheses using data on 27352 juvenile trees, representing
   278 species from 27 sites on all forested continents, and extensive
   functional trait data, 38\% of which were obtained at the same sites at
   which growth was assessed. Data on potential evapotranspiration (PET),
   which summarizes the joint ecological effects of temperature and
   precipitation, were obtained from a global data base. We estimated
   size-standardized relative height growth rates (SGR) for all species,
   then related them to functional traits and PET using mixed-effect models
   for the fastest growing species and for all species together. Both the
   mean and 95th percentile SGR were more strongly associated with
   functional traits than with PET. PET was unrelated to SGR at the global
   scale. SGR increased with increasing SLA and decreased with increasing
   wood density and seed mass, but these traits explained only 3.1\% of the
   variation in SGR. SGR-trait relationships were consistently weak across
   families and biogeographic zones, and over a range of tree statures.
   Thus, the most widely studied functional traits in plant ecology were
   poor predictors of tree growth over large scales.Synthesis. We conclude
   that these functional traits alone may be unsuitable for predicting
   growth of trees over broad scales. Determining the functional traits
   that predict vital rates under specific environmental conditions may
   generate more insight than a monolithic global relationship can offer.}},

Abstract = {{Trophic cascades are indirect positive effects of predators on resources
   via control of intermediate consumers. Larger-bodied predators appear to
   induce stronger trophic cascades (a greater rebound of resource density
   toward carrying capacity), but how this happens is unknown because we
   lack a clear depiction of how the strength of trophic cascades is
   determined. Using consumer resource models, we first show that the
   strength of a trophic cascade has an upper limit set by the interaction
   strength between the basal trophic group and its consumer and that this
   limit is approached as the interaction strength between the consumer and
   its predator increases. We then express the strength of a trophic
   cascade explicitly in terms of predator body size and use two
   independent parameter sets to calculate how the strength of a trophic
   cascade depends on predator size. Both parameter sets predict a positive
   effect of predator size on the strength of a trophic cascade, driven
   mostly by the body size dependence of the interaction strength between
   the first two trophic levels. Our results support previous empirical
   findings and suggest that the loss of larger predators will have greater
   consequences on trophic control and biomass structure in food webs than
   the loss of smaller predators.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem responses to changes in species diversity are often studied
   individually. However, changes in species diversity can simultaneously
   influence multiple interdependent ecosystem functions. Therefore, an
   important challenge is to determine when and how changes in species
   diversity that influence one function will also drive changes in other
   functions. By providing the underlying structure of species
   interactions, ecological networks can quantify connections between
   biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions. Here, we review parallels
   in the conceptual development of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning
   (BEF) and food web theory (FWT) research. Subsequently, we evaluate
   three common principles that unite these two research areas by
   explaining the patterns, concentrations, and direction of the flux of
   nutrients and energy through the species in diverse interaction webs. We
   give examples of combined BEF-FWT approaches that can be used to
   identify vulnerable species and habitats and to evaluate links that
   drive trade-offs between multiple ecosystems functions. These combined
   approaches reflect promising trends towards better management of
   biodiversity in landscapes that provide essential ecosystem services
   supporting human well-being.}},

Title = {{Heterostyly promotes disassortative pollination and reduces sexual
   interference in Darwin's primroses: evidence from experimental studies}},

Abstract = {{<list list-type={''}1{''} id={''}fec12274-list-0001{''}> Different
   strategies to reduce selfing and promote outcrossing have evolved in
   hermaphroditic flowers. Heterostyly, a complex floral polymorphism that
   occurs in at least 27 families of angiosperms, is hypothesized to
   achieve both goals by optimizing cross-pollination (via disassortative
   pollen transfer) and restricting gamete wastage to autogamy (via the
   reduction in sexual interference between male and female organs). In
   heterostylous flowers, the reciprocal positioning of sexual organs in
   different morphs and the pollen incompatibility system within flower or
   between flowers of the same morph are thought to optimize both male and
   female functions, reducing the conflicts inherent to the occurrence of
   both sexual organs in the same reproductive unit. Specific elements of
   the disassortative-pollination and sexual-interference hypotheses have
   been tested individually before. However, despite the long-standing
   interest in heterostyly - ever since Darwin's seminal work on primroses
   - the predictions derived from these two hypotheses have never been
   experimentally and systematically examined in the same system. Using
   distylous primroses (Primula elatior, P.vulgaris), we compare pollen
   transfer (i) between reciprocal and non-reciprocal flowers; (ii) from
   anthers onto different parts of the pollinator's body; and (iii) within
   flower and between flowers of the same morph. We further test whether
   (iv) anther-stigma distance correlates with self-pollen transfer and
   whether (v) seed set differs after pollinations with compatible,
   incompatible and both pollen types. Reciprocal herkogamy promotes
   differential placement of pollen onto different parts of the
   pollinator's body, thus effecting transfer of more pollen to reciprocal
   than to non-reciprocal stigmas and realizing the key predictions of the
   disassortative-pollination hypothesis. However, short-styled flowers
   transfer pollen more disassortatively than long-styled flowers in both
   species, whereas long-styled flowers export more pollen to
   non-reciprocal than to reciprocal stigmas in P.vulgaris, thus
   compromising male function in this species. Furthermore, larger distance
   between sexual organs lowers self- and intra-morph pollination and the
   pollen incompatibility system decreases seed production after
   self-pollination, thus diminishing sexual interference. Our results help
   us understand how the morphological and physiological components of
   heterostyly contribute to optimizing pollen transfer and minimizing
   self- and intra-morph pollination, thus promoting more efficient
   outcrossing in species with this floral polymorphism. <doi

Title = {{Assessing Internet energy intensity: A review of methods and results}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{63-68}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Assessing the average energy intensity of Internet transmissions is a
   complex task that has been a controversial subject of discussion.
   Estimates published over the last decade diverge by up to four orders of
   magnitude from 0.0064 kilowatt-hours per gigabyte (kWh/GB) to 136
   kWh/GB. This article presents a review of the methodological approaches
   used so far in such assessments: i) top-down analyses based on estimates
   of the overall Internet energy consumption and the overall Internet
   traffic, whereby average energy intensity is calculated by dividing
   energy by traffic for a given period of time, ii) model-based approaches
   that model all components needed to sustain an amount of Internet
   traffic, and iii) bottom-up approaches based on case studies and
   generalization of the results. Our analysis of the existing studies
   shows that the large spread of results is mainly caused by two factors:
   a) the year of reference of the analysis, which has significant
   influence due to efficiency gains in electronic equipment, and b)
   whether end devices such as personal computers or servers are included
   within the system boundary or not. For an overall assessment of the
   energy needed to perform a specific task involving the Internet, it is
   necessary to account for the types of end devices needed for the task,
   while the energy needed for data transmission can be added based on a
   generic estimate of Internet energy intensity for a given year.
   Separating the Internet as a data transmission system from the end
   devices leads to more accurate models and to results that are more
   informative for decision makers, because end devices and the networking
   equipment of the Internet usually belong to different spheres of
   control. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The improvement of wheat through breeding has relied strongly on the use
   of genetic material from related wild and domesticated grass species.
   The 1RS chromosome arm from rye was introgressed into wheat and crossed
   into many wheat lines, as it improves yield and fungal disease
   resistance. Pm8 is a powdery mildew resistance gene on 1RS which, after
   widespread agricultural cultivation, is now widely overcome by adapted
   mildew races. Here we show by homology-based cloning and subsequent
   physical and genetic mapping that Pm8 is the rye orthologue of the Pm3
   allelic series of mildew resistance genes in wheat. The cloned gene was
   functionally validated as Pm8 by transient, single-cell expression
   analysis and stable transformation. Sequence analysis revealed a complex
   mosaic of ancient haplotypes among Pm3- and Pm8-like genes from
   different members of the Triticeae. These results show that the two
   genes have evolved independently after the divergence of the species 7.5
   million years ago and kept their function in mildew resistance. During
   this long time span the co-evolving pathogens have not overcome these
   genes, which is in strong contrast to the breakdown of Pm8 resistance
   since its introduction into commercial wheat 70years ago. Sequence
   comparison revealed that evolutionary pressure acted on the same
   subdomains and sequence features of the two orthologous genes. This
   suggests that they recognize directly or indirectly the same pathogen
   effectors that have been conserved in the powdery mildews of wheat and
   rye.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Burkholderia cenocepacia is a Gram-negative aerobic bacterium that
   belongs to a group of opportunistic pathogens displaying diverse
   environmental and pathogenic lifestyles. B. cenocepacia is known for its
   ability to cause lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis and it
   possesses a large 8 Mb multireplicon genome encoding a wide array of
   pathogenicity and fitness genes. Transcriptomic profiling across nine
   growth conditions was performed to identify the global gene expression
   changes made when B. cenocepacia changes niches from an environmental
   lifestyle to infection. In comparison to exponential growth, the results
   demonstrated that B. cenocepacia changes expression of over one-quarter
   of its genome during conditions of growth arrest, stationary phase and
   surprisingly, under reduced oxygen concentrations (6\% instead of 20.9\%
   normal atmospheric conditions). Multiple virulence factors are
   upregulated during these growth arrest conditions. A unique discovery
   from the comparative expression analysis was the identification of a
   distinct, co-regulated 50-gene cluster that was significantly
   upregulated during growth under low oxygen conditions. This gene cluster
   was designated the low-oxygen-activated (lxa) locus and encodes six
   universal stress proteins and proteins predicted to be involved in
   metabolism, transport, electron transfer and regulation. Deletion of the
   lxa locus resulted in B. cenocepacia mutants with aerobic growth
   deficiencies in minimal medium and compromised viability after prolonged
   incubation in the absence of oxygen. In summary, transcriptomic
   profiling of B. cenocepacia revealed an unexpected ability of aerobic
   Burkholderia to persist in the absence of oxygen and identified the
   novel lxa locus as key determinant of this important ecophysiological
   trait.}},

Abstract = {{The Early Cambrian organism Olivooides is known from both embryonic and
   post-embryonic stages and, consequently, it has the potential to yield
   vital insights into developmental evolution at the time that animal body
   plans were established. However, this potential can only be realized if
   the phylogenetic relationships of Olivooides can be constrained. The
   affinities of Olivooides have proved controversial because of the lack
   of knowledge of the internal anatomy and the limited range of
   developmental stages known. Here, we describe rare embryonic specimens
   in which internal anatomical features are preserved. We also present a
   fuller sequence of fossilized developmental stages of Olivooides,
   including associated specimens that we interpret as budding ephyrae
   (juvenile medusae), all of which display a clear pentaradial symmetry.
   Within the framework of a cnidarian interpretation, the new data serve
   to pinpoint the phylogenetic position of Olivooides to the scyphozoan
   stem group. Hypotheses about scalidophoran or echinoderm affinities of
   Olivooides can be rejected.}},

Title = {{Apparent resource partitioning and trophic structure of large-bodied
   marine predators in a relatively pristine seagrass ecosystem}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{481}},
Pages = {{225-237}},
Abstract = {{Large predators often play important roles in structuring marine
   communities. To understand the role that these predators play in
   ecosystems, it is crucial to have knowledge of their interactions and
   the degree to which their trophic roles are complementary or redundant
   among species. We used stable isotope analysis to examine the isotopic
   niche overlap of dolphins Tursiops cf. aduncus, large sharks (>1.5 m
   total length), and smaller elasmobranchs (sharks and batoids) in the
   relatively pristine seagrass community of Shark Bay, Australia. Dolphins
   and large sharks differed in their mean isotopic values for delta C-13
   and delta N-15, and each group occupied a relatively unique area in
   isotopic niche space. The standard ellipse areas (SEAc; based on
   bivariate standard deviations) of dolphins, large sharks, small sharks,
   and rays did not overlap. Tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier had the highest
   delta N-15 values, although the mean delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of
   pigeye sharks Carcharhinus amboinensis were similar. Other large sharks
   (e.g. sicklefin lemon sharks Negaprion acutidens and sandbar sharks
   Carcharhinus plumbeus) and dolphins appeared to feed at slightly lower
   trophic levels than tiger sharks. In this seagrass-dominated ecosystem,
   seagrass-derived carbon appears to be more important for elasmobranchs
   than it is for dolphins. Habitat use patterns did not correlate well
   with the sources of productivity supporting diets, suggesting that
   habitat use patterns may not necessarily be reflective of the resource
   pools supporting a population and highlights the importance of detailed
   datasets on trophic interactions for elucidating the ecological roles of
   predators.}},

Abstract = {{Most glaciers and ice caps (GIC) are out of balance with the current
   climate. To return to equilibrium, GIC must thin and retreat, losing
   additional mass and raising sea level. Because glacier observations are
   sparse and geographically biased, there is an undersampling problem
   common to all global assessments. Here, we further develop an assessment
   approach based on accumulation-area ratios (AAR) to estimate committed
   mass losses and analyze the undersampling problem. We compiled all
   available AAR observations for 144 GIC from 1971 to 2010, and found that
   most glaciers and ice caps are farther from balance than previously
   believed. Accounting for regional and global undersampling errors, our
   model suggests that GIC are committed to additional losses of 32 +/-
   12\% of their area and 38 +/- 16\% of their volume if the future climate
   resembles the climate of the past decade. These losses imply global mean
   sea-level rise of 163 +/- 69 mm, assuming total glacier volume of 430 mm
   sea-level equivalent. To reduce the large uncertainties in these
   projections, more long-term glacier measurements are needed in poorly
   sampled regions.}},

Abstract = {{Several multi-year biodiversity experiments have shown positive species
   richness-productivity relationships which strengthen over time, but the
   mechanisms which control productivity are not well understood. We used
   experimental grasslands (Jena Experiment) with mixtures containing
   different numbers of species (4, 8, 16 and 60) and plant functional
   groups (1-4; grasses, legumes, small herbs, tall herbs) to explore
   patterns of variation in functional trait composition as well as
   climatic variables as predictors for community biomass production across
   several years (from 2003 to 2009). Over this time span, high community
   mean trait values shifted from the dominance of trait values associated
   with fast growth to trait values suggesting a conservation of
   growth-related resources and successful reproduction. Increasing
   between-community convergence in means of several productivity-related
   traits indicated that environmental filtering and exclusion of
   competitively weaker species played a role during community assembly. A
   general trend for increasing functional trait diversity within and
   convergence among communities suggested niche differentiation through
   limiting similarity in the longer term and that similar mechanisms
   operated in communities sown with different diversity. Community biomass
   production was primarily explained by a few key mean traits (tall
   growth, large seed mass and leaf nitrogen concentration) and to a
   smaller extent by functional diversity in nitrogen acquisition
   strategies, functional richness in multiple traits and functional
   evenness in light-acquisition traits. Increasing species richness,
   presence of an exceptionally productive legume species (Onobrychis
   viciifolia) and climatic variables explained an additional proportion of
   variation in community biomass. In general, community biomass production
   decreased through time, but communities with higher functional richness
   in multiple traits had high productivities over several years. Our
   results suggest that assembly processes within communities with an
   artificially maintained species composition maximize functional
   diversity through niche differentiation and exclusion of weaker
   competitors, thereby maintaining their potential for high productivity.

Abstract = {{This study presents volume and mass changes of seven (five partially
   debris-covered, two debris-free) glaciers in the upper Langtang
   catchment in Nepal. We use a digital elevation model (DEM) from 1974
   stereo Hexagon satellite data and seven DEMs derived from 2006-2015
   stereo or tri-stereo satellite imagery (e.g., SPOT6/7). The availability
   of multiple independent DEM differences allows the identification of a
   robust signal and narrowing down of the uncertainty about recent volume
   changes. The volume changes calculated over several multiyear periods
   between 2006 and 2015 consistently indicate that glacier thinning has
   accelerated with respect to the period 1974-2006. We calculate an
   ensemble-mean elevation change rate of -0.45aEuro-+/-
   aEuro-0.18aEuro-maEuro-a(-1) for 2006-2015, while for the period
   1974-2006 we compute a rate of -0.24aEuro-+/-
   aEuro-0.08aEuro-maEuro-a(-1). However, the behavior of glaciers in the
   study area is heterogeneous, and the presence or absence of debris does
   not seem to be a good predictor for mass balance trends. Debris-covered
   tongues have nonlinear thinning profiles, and we show that recent
   accelerations in thinning correlate with the presence of supraglacial
   cliffs and lakes. At stagnating glacier areas near the glacier front,
   however, thinning rates decreased with time or remained constant. The
   April 2015 Nepal earthquake triggered large avalanches in the study
   catchment. Analysis of two post-earthquake DEMs revealed that the
   avalanche deposit volumes remaining 6 months after the earthquake are
   negligible in comparison to 2006-2015 elevation changes. However, the
   deposits compensate about 40aEuro-\% the mass loss of debris-covered
   tongues of 1 average year.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical rainforest hyperdiversity is often suggested to have evolved
   over a long time-span (the museum' model), but there is also evidence
   for recent rainforest radiations. The mahoganies (Meliaceae) are a
   prominent plant group in lowland tropical rainforests world-wide but
   also occur in all other tropical ecosystems. We investigated whether
   rainforest diversity in Meliaceae has accumulated over a long time or
   has more recently evolved. We inferred the largest time-calibrated
   phylogeny for the family to date, reconstructed ancestral states for
   habitat and deciduousness, estimated diversification rates and modeled
   potential shifts in macro-evolutionary processes using a recently
   developed Bayesian method. The ancestral Meliaceae is reconstructed as a
   deciduous species that inhabited seasonal habitats. Rainforest clades
   have diversified from the Late Oligocene or Early Miocene onwards. Two
   contemporaneous Amazonian clades have converged on similar ecologies and
   high speciation rates. Most species-level diversity of Meliaceae in
   rainforest is recent. Other studies have found steady accumulation of
   lineages, but the large majority of plant species diversity in
   rainforests is recent, suggesting (episodic) species turnover.
   Rainforest hyperdiversity may best be explained by recent radiations
   from a large stock of higher level taxa.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we tackle the question of discovering an effective set of
   spatial filters to solve hyperspectral classification problems. Instead
   of fixing a priori the filters and their parameters using expert
   knowledge, we let the model find them within random draws in the
   (possibly infinite) space of possible filters. We define an active set
   feature learner that includes in the model only features that improve
   the classifier. To this end, we consider a fast and linear classifier,
   multiclass logistic classification, and show that with a good
   representation (the filters discovered), such a simple classifier can
   reach at least state of the art performances. We apply the proposed
   active set learner in four hyperspectral image classification problems,
   including agricultural and urban classification at different
   resolutions, as well as multimodal data. We also propose a hierarchical
   setting, which allows to generate more complex banks of features that
   can better describe the nonlinearities present in the data. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Observed streamflow of headwater catchments of the Tarim River (Central
   Asia) increased by about 30\% over the period 1957-2004. This study aims
   at assessing to which extent these streamflow trends can be attributed
   to changes in air temperature or precipitation. The analysis includes a
   data-based approach using multiple linear regression and a
   simulation-based approach using a hydrological model. The hydrological
   model considers changes in both glacier area and surface elevation. It
   was calibrated using a multiobjective optimization algorithm with
   calibration criteria based on glacier mass balance and daily and
   interannual variations of discharge. The individual contributions to the
   overall streamflow trends from changes in glacier geometry, temperature,
   and precipitation were assessed using simulation experiments with a
   constant glacier geometry and with detrended temperature and
   precipitation time series. The results showed that the observed changes
   in streamflow were consistent with the changes in temperature and
   precipitation. In the Sari-Djaz catchment, increasing temperatures and
   related increase of glacier melt were identified as the dominant driver,
   while in the Kakshaal catchment, both increasing temperatures and
   increasing precipitation played a major role. Comparing the two
   approaches, an advantage of the simulation-based approach is the fact
   that it is based on process-based relationships implemented in the
   hydrological model instead of statistical links in the regression model.
   However, data-based approaches are less affected by model parameter and
   structural uncertainties and typically fast to apply. A complementary
   application of both approaches is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The role of resource availability in determining the incidence of
   masting has been widely studied, but how floral transition and
   initiation are regulated by the resource level is unclear. We tested the
   hypothesis that floral transition is stimulated by high resource
   availabiltiy in Fagus crenata based on a new technique, the expression
   analyses of flowering genes. We isolated F. crenata orthologues of
   FLOWERING LOCUS T, LEAFY and APETALA1, and confirmed their functions
   using transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. We monitored the gene expression
   levels for 5 years and detected a cycle of on and off years, which was
   correlated with fluctuations of the shoot-nitrogen concentration.
   Nitrogen fertilisation resulted in the significantly higher expression
   of flowering genes than the control, where all of the fertilised trees
   flowered, whereas the control did not. Our findings identified nitrogen
   as a key regulator of mast flowering, thereby providing new empirical
   evidence to support the resource budget model.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation and monitoring of forest biodiversity requires reliable
   information about forest structure and composition at multiple spatial
   scales. However, detailed data about forest habitat characteristics
   across large areas are often incomplete due to difficulties associated
   with field sampling methods. To overcome this limitation we employed a
   nationally available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing
   dataset to develop variables describing forest landscape structure
   across a large environmental gradient in Switzerland. Using a model
   species indicative of structurally rich mountain forests (hazel grouse
   Bonasa bonasia), we tested the potential of such variables to predict
   species occurrence and evaluated the additional benefit of LiDAR data
   when used in combination with traditional, sample plot-based field
   variables. We calibrated boosted regression trees (BRT) models for both
   variable sets separately and in combination, and compared the models'
   accuracies. While both field-based and LiDAR models performed well,
   combining the two data sources improved the accuracy of the species'
   habitat model. The variables retained from the two datasets held
   different types of information: field variables mostly quantified food
   resources and cover in the field and shrub layer, LiDAR variables
   characterized heterogeneity of vegetation structure which correlated
   with field variables describing the understory and ground vegetation.
   When combined with data on forest vegetation composition from field
   surveys, LiDAR provides valuable complementary information for
   encompassing species niches more comprehensively. Thus, LiDAR bridges
   the gap between precise, locally restricted field-data and coarse
   digital land cover information by reliably identifying habitat structure
   and quality across large areas.}},

Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{635-645}},

Abstract = {{In sharp contrast with mammals and birds, many cold-blooded vertebrates
   present homomorphic sex chromosomes. Empirical evidence supports a role
   for frequent turnovers, which replace nonrecombining sex chromosomes
   before they have time to decay. Three main mechanisms have been proposed
   for such turnovers, relying either on neutral processes, sex-ratio
   selection, or intrinsic benefits of the new sex-determining genes (due,
   e.g., to linkage with sexually antagonistic mutations). Here, we suggest
   an additional mechanism, arising from the load of deleterious mutations
   that accumulate on nonrecombining sex chromosomes. In the absence of
   dosage compensation, this load should progressively lower survival rate
   in the heterogametic sex. Turnovers should occur when this cost
   outweighs the benefits gained from any sexually antagonistic genes
   carried by the nonrecombining sex chromosome. We use individual-based
   simulations of a Muller's ratchet process to test this prediction, and
   investigate how the relevant parameters (effective population size,
   strength and dominance of deleterious mutations, size of nonrecombining
   segment, and strength of sexually antagonistic selection) are expected
   to affect the rate of turnovers.}},

Abstract = {{A new algorithm for snow cover monitoring at 250 m resolution based on
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images is
   presented. In contrast to the 500 m resolution MODIS snow products of
   NASA (MOD10 and MYD10), the main goal was to maintain the resolution as
   high as possible to allow for a more accurate detection of snow covered
   area (SCA). This is especially important in mountainous regions
   characterized by extreme landscape heterogeneity, where maps at a
   resolution of 500 m could not provide the desired amount of spatial
   details. Therefore, the algorithm exploits only the 250 m resolution
   bands of MODIS in the red (B1) and infrared (B2) spectrum, as well as
   the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for snow detection,
   while clouds are classified using also bands at 500 m and 1 km
   resolution. The algorithm is tailored to process MODIS data received in
   real-time through the EURAC receiving station close to Bolzano, Italy,
   but also standard MODIS products are supported. It is divided into three
   steps: first the data is preprocessed, including reprojection,
   calculation of physical reflectance values and masking of water bodies.
   In a second step, the actual classification of snow, snow in forested
   areas, and clouds takes place based on MODIS images both from Terra and
   Aqua satellites. In the third step, snow cover maps derived from images
   of both sensors of the same day are combined to reduce cloud coverage in
   the final SCA product. Four different quality indices are calculated to
   verify the reliability of input data, snow classification, cloud
   detection and viewing geometry. Using the data received through their
   own station, EURAC can provide SCA maps of central Europe to end users
   in near real-time. Validation of the algorithm is outlined in a
   companion paper and indicates good performance with accuracies ranging
   from 94\% to around 82\% compared to in situ snow depth measurements,
   and around 93\% compared to SCA derived from Landsat ETM+ images.}},

Abstract = {{YUCCA family genes act in response to multiple signals in leaf explants
   and contribute to de novo auxin biogenesis for fate transition of
   regeneration-competent cells.Many plant organs have the ability to
   regenerate a new plant after detachment or wounding via de novo
   organogenesis. During de novo root organogenesis from Arabidopsis
   thaliana leaf explants, endogenic auxin is essential for the fate
   transition of regeneration-competent cells to become root founder cells
   via activation of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 11 (WOX11). However, the
   molecular events from leaf explant detachment to auxin-mediated cell
   fate transition are poorly understood. In this study, we used an assay
   to determine the concentration of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to provide
   direct evidence that auxin is produced after leaf explant detachment, a
   process that involves YUCCA (YUC)-mediated auxin biogenesis. Inhibition
   of YUC prevents expression of WOX11 and fate transition of competent
   cells, resulting in the blocking of rooting. Further analysis showed
   that YUC1 and YUC4 act quickly (within 4 hours) in response to wounding
   after detachment in both light and dark conditions and promote auxin
   biogenesis in both mesophyll and competent cells, whereas YUC5, YUC8,
   and YUC9 primarily respond in dark conditions. In addition, YUC2 and
   YUC6 contribute to rooting by providing a basal auxin level in the leaf.
   Overall, our study indicates that YUC genes exhibit a division of labour
   during de novo root organogenesis from leaf explants in response to
   multiple signals.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbial biomass is a key determinant of carbon dynamics in the
   soil. Several studies have shown that soil microbial biomass
   significantly increases with plant species diversity, but it remains
   unclear whether plant species diversity can also stabilize soil
   microbial biomass in a changing environment. This question is
   particularly relevant as many global environmental change (GEC) factors,
   such as drought and nutrient enrichment, have been shown to reduce soil
   microbial biomass. Experiments with orthogonal manipulations of plant
   diversity and GEC factors can provide insights whether plant diversity
   can attenuate such detrimental effects on soil microbial biomass. Here,
   we present the analysis of 12 different studies with 14 unique
   orthogonal plant diversity 9 GEC manipulations in grasslands, where
   plant diversity and at least one GEC factor (elevated CO2, nutrient
   enrichment, drought, earthworm presence, or warming) were manipulated.
   Our results show that higher plant diversity significantly enhances soil
   microbial biomass with the strongest effects in long-term field
   experiments. In contrast, GEC factors had inconsistent effects with only
   drought having a significant negative effect. Importantly, we report
   consistent non-significant effects for all 14 interactions between plant
   diversity and GEC factors, which indicates a limited potential of plant
   diversity to attenuate the effects of GEC factors on soil microbial
   biomass. We highlight that plant diversity is a major determinant of
   soil microbial biomass in experimental grasslands that can influence
   soil carbon dynamics irrespective of GEC.}},

Title = {{Using targeted enrichment of nuclear genes to increase phylogenetic
   resolution in the neotropical rain forest genus Inga (Leguminosae:
   Mimosoideae)}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary radiations are prominent and pervasive across many plant
   lineages in diverse geographical and ecological settings; in neotropical
   rainforests there is growing evidence suggesting that a significant
   fraction of species richness is the result of recent radiations.
   Understanding the evolutionary trajectories and mechanisms underlying
   these radiations demands much greater phylogenetic resolution than is
   currently available for these groups. The neotropical tree genus toga
   (Leguminosae) is a good example, with 300 extant species and a crown age
   of 2-10 MY, yet over 6 kb of plastid and nuclear DNA sequence data gives
   only poor phylogenetic resolution among species. Here we explore the use
   of larger scale nuclear gene data obtained though targeted enrichment to
   increase phylogenetic resolution within Inga. Transcriptome data from
   three Inga species were used to select 264 nuclear loci for targeted
   enrichment and sequencing. Following quality control to remove probable
   paralogs from these sequence data, the final dataset comprised 259,313
   bases from 194 loci for 24 accessions representing 22 Inga species and
   an outgroup (Zygia). Bayesian phylogenies reconstructed using either all
   loci concatenated or a gene-tree/species-tree approach yielded highly
   resolved phylogenies. We used coalescent approaches to show that the
   same targeted enrichment data also have significant power to
   discriminate among alternative within-species population histories
   within the widespread species I. umbellifera. In either application,
   targeted enrichment simplifies the informatics challenge of identifying
   orthologous loci associated with de novo genome sequencing. We conclude
   that targeted enrichment provides the large volumes of
   phylogenetically-informative sequence data required to resolve
   relationships within recent plant species radiations, both at the
   species level and for within-species phylogeographic studies.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The prevalence of phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) in nature is
   still a conflicting issue. Disagreement arises from confusion over its
   precise definition and the variety of approaches to measure its
   prevalence. Recent work highlighted that common measures of PNC strongly
   depend on the assumptions of the underlying model of niche evolution.
   However, this warning has not been well recognized in the applied
   literature and questionable approaches are still frequently applied. The
   aim of this study is to draw attention to the assumptions underlying
   commonly applied simple measures of PNC. We used a series of simulations
   to illustrate how misleading results can be if assumptions of niche
   evolution are violated, that the violation of assumptions is a common
   phenomenon and that testing assumptions requires in-depth pretest. We
   conclude that the seemingly simple measures of PNC, such as phylogenetic
   signal (PS) and evolutionary rate, are not so easy to apply if one
   accounts for the necessity to test model assumptions. In addition, these
   measures can be difficult to interpret. The common assumption that
   strong PS indicates PNC will be often invalid. In addition, the
   interpretation of some measures, for example the conclusion that
   evolutionary rate is slow enough to indicate PNC, requires a comparison
   with another clade, another trait or well-developed null model
   assumptions and thus additional data. We suggest that studies
   investigating PNC should always compare alternative evolutionary models
   and that model comparisons should in particular include flexible niche
   evolution models such as multiple-optima OU models, although these are
   computational intensive. These models are directly inherited from the
   concept of macroevolutionary adaptive landscape and can indicate PNC
   either by relative few peak shifts or by narrow peaks in the adaptive
   landscape. A test of PNC thus requires comparing these parameters of the
   macroevolutionary landscape between clades or time periods. The general
   prevalence of PNC in nature should be evaluated only based on studies
   keeping up to the high standards of communicating the used definition of
   PNC, testing the assumptions made in the modelling approaches and
   including newly developed models in a model comparison approach.}},

Abstract = {{Glomeromycota have been considered the most ancient group of fungi
   capable of positively interacting with plants for many years. Recently,
   other basal fungi, the Endogone Mucoromycotina fungi, have been
   identified as novel plant symbionts, challenging the paradigm of
   Glomeromycota as the unique ancestral symbionts of land plants.
   Glomeromycota are known to host endobacteria and recent evidences show
   that also some Mucoromycotina contain endobacteria. In order to examine
   similarities between basal groups of plant-associated fungi, we tested
   whether Endogone contained endobacteria. Twenty-nine Endogone were
   investigated in order to identify Mollicutes-related endobacteria (Mre).
   Fruiting bodies were processed for transmission electron microscopy and
   molecularly investigated using fungal and Mre-specific primers. We
   demonstrate that Mre are present inside 13 out of 29 Endogone:
   endobacteria are directly embedded in the fungal cytoplasm and their 16S
   rDNA sequences cluster together with the ones retrieved from
   Glomeromycota, forming, however, a separate new clade. Our findings
   provide new insights on the evolutionary relations between
   Glomeromycota, Mucoromycotina and endobacteria, raising new questions on
   the role of these still enigmatic microbes in the ecology, evolution and
   diversification of their fungal hosts during the history of plant-fungal
   symbiosis.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient resource use is a key factor for sustainable production and a

   open-top lysimeters comprising a volume of 230L. The lysimeters were
   filled with sterilized soil in two horizons and inoculated with a
   reduced soil-life inoculum (soil biota 11m, microbially dominated) and
   an enriched soil-life inoculum {[}soil organisms 2mm, also containing
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)]. A crop rotation was planted, and
   nutrient leaching losses, plant biomass and nutrient contents were
   assessed over a period of almost 2years. In the first year of the
   experiment, enriched soil life increased crop yield (+22\%), N uptake
   (+29\%) and P uptake (+110\%) of maize and strongly reduced leaching
   losses of N (-51\%, corresponding to a reduction of 76kg N ha(-1)). In
   the second year, wheat biomass (+17\%) and P contents (+80\%) were
   significantly increased by enriched soil life, but the differences were
   lower than in the first year.
   Enriched soil life also increased P mobilization from soil (+112\%) and
   significantly reduced relative P leaching losses (-25\%), defined as g P
   leached per kg P plant uptake, as well as relative N leaching losses
   (-36\%), defined as kg N leached per kg N plant uptake, demonstrating
   that nutrient-use efficiency was increased in the enriched soil-life
   treatment.
   Synthesis and applications. Soil biota are a key factor determining
   resource efficiency in agriculture. The results suggest that applying
   farming practices, which favour a rich and abundant soil life (e.g.
   reduced tillage, organic farming, crop rotation), can reduce
   environmental impacts, enhance crop yield and result in a more
   sustainable agricultural system. However, this needs to be confirmed in
   field situations. Enhanced nutrient-use efficiency obtained through
   farming practices which exert positive effects on soil biota could
   result in reduced amounts of fertilisers needed for agricultural
   production and reduced nutrient losses to the environment, providing
   benefits of such practices beyond positive effects on biodiversity.

Abstract = {{Bacteria typically rely on secreted metabolites, potentially shareable
   at the community level, to scavenge resources from the environment. The
   evolution of diffusible, shareable metabolites is, however, difficult to
   explain because molecules can get lost, or be exploited by cheating
   mutants. A key question is whether natural selection can act on molecule
   structure to control loss and shareability. We tested this possibility
   by collating information on diffusivity properties of 189 secreted
   iron-scavenging siderophores and the natural habitats occupied by the
   siderophore-producing species. In line with evolutionary theory, we
   found that highly diffusible siderophores have preferentially evolved in
   species living in structured habitats, such as soil and hosts, because
   structuring can keep producers and their shareable goods together.
   Poorly diffusible siderophores, meanwhile, have preferentially evolved
   in species living in unstructured habitats, such as seawater, indicating
   that these metabolites are less shareable and more likely provide direct
   benefits to the producers.}},

Abstract = {{Forest ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle and
   it is largely unknown how this role might be altered by transients
   imposed by global change and deforestation. Remote sensing can provide
   information on ecosystem state and functioning and, among others, two
   remote sensing techniques, airborne laser scanning (ALS) and imaging
   spectroscopy (IS), have been used to characterize forest ecosystems,
   both independently and combined in fusion approaches. However, the
   fusion of these datasets should make the best use of the complementarity
   of both sensors and provide better and more robust vegetation products
   in forested ecosystems. Similar to other data fusion approaches,
   satisfying results depend on choosing appropriate fusion levels and
   methods. In this review paper, we summarize and classify relevant
   studies that focused on forest characterization using combined ALS and
   IS data, limited to the last decade. We classified the approaches by
   fusion level (data or product level) and by choice of methods (physical
   or empirical methods). Five different categories of products (landcover
   maps, aboveground biomass, biophysical parameters, gross/net primary
   productivity and biochemical parameters), have been found as the main
   aspects of forest ecosystems studied so far. A qualitative accuracy
   analysis of the products exposed that currently landcover maps are
   profiting the most from ALS and IS data fusion, while there is room for
   improvements in respect to the other products, such as biophysical
   parameters. Only few studies using physical approaches were found, but
   we expect the use of such approaches will increase with the growing
   availability of physically based radiative transfer models that can
   simulate both, ALS and IS data. (C) 2014 International Society for

Volume = {{174}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Most angiosperms have gynoecia with two to five carpels. However, more
   than five carpels (here termed multicarpellate condition') are present
   in some representatives of all larger subclades of angiosperms. In such
   multicarpellate gynoecia, the carpels are in either one or more than one
   whorl (or series). I focus especially on gynoecia in which the carpels
   are in a single whorl (or series). In such multicarpellate syncarpous
   gynoecia, the closure in the centre of the gynoecium is imprecise as a
   result of slightly irregular development of the carpel flanks. Irregular
   bumps appear to stuff the remaining holes. In multicarpellate gynoecia,
   the centre of the remaining floral apex is not involved in carpel
   morphogenesis, so that this unspent part of the floral apex remains
   morphologically undifferentiated. It usually becomes enclosed within the
   gynoecium, but, in some cases, remains exposed and may or may not form
   simple excrescences. The area within the remaining floral apex is
   histologically characterized by a parenchyma of simple longitudinal cell
   rows. In highly multicarpellate gynoecia with the carpels in a whorl,
   the whorl tends to be deformed into an H-shaped or star-shaped structure
   by differential growth of the floral sectors, so that carpels become
   aligned in parallel rows, in which they face each other with the ventral
   sides. In this way, a fractionated compitum may still be functional.
   Multicarpellate gynoecia (with the carpels in one whorl or series) occur
   in at least one species in 37 of the 63 angiosperm orders. In contrast,
   non-multicarpellate gynoecia are present in at least one species of all
   63 orders. The basal condition in angiosperms is more likely
   non-multicarpellate. Multicarpellate gynoecia are restricted to flowers
   that are not highly synorganized. In groups with synorganized androecium
   and gynoecium and in groups with elaborate monosymmetric flowers,
   multicarpellate gynoecia are lacking.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of
   London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 174, 1-43.}},

Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{659-672}},
Abstract = {{Glacier fluctuations contribute to variations in sea level and
   historical glacier length fluctuations are natural indicators of past
   climate change. To study these subjects, long-term information of
   glacier change is needed. In this paper we present a data set of global
   long-term glacier length fluctuations. The data set is a compilation of
   available information on changes in glacier length worldwide, including
   both measured and reconstructed glacier length fluctuations. All 471
   length series start before 1950 and cover at least four decades. The
   longest record starts in 1535, but the majority of time series start
   after 1850. The number of available records decreases again after 1962.
   The data set has global coverage including records from all continents.
   However, the Canadian Arctic is not represented in the data set. The
   available glacier length series show relatively small fluctuations until
   the mid-19th century, followed by a global retreat. The retreat was
   strongest in the first half of the 20th century, although large
   variability in the length change of the different glaciers is observed.
   During the 20th century, calving glaciers retreated more than
   land-terminating glaciers, but their relative length change was
   approximately equal. Besides calving, the glacier slope is the most
   important glacier property determining length change: steep glaciers
   have retreated less than glaciers with a gentle slope.}},

Abstract = {{For the observation and monitoring of glacier surface velocity (GSV),
   remote sensing is an increasingly suitable tool thanks to the high
   temporal and spatial resolution of the data. Radar sensors have the
   specific advantage over optical sensors of being nearly weather and
   time-independent.
   Two image pairs separated by 11 days, acquired with the high-resolution
   spotlight (HS) and stripmap (SM) modes of the German sensor TerraSAR-X,
   were used to estimate GSV over Switzerland's Aletsch Glacier. The SM
   mode covers larger ground swaths, making it more suitable for
   glacier-wide observations, while the HS images cover less area but offer
   the highest-possible spatial resolution, approximately 1 x 1 m on the
   ground. The images were acquired during the summer to maximise feature
   visibility by minimal snow cover.
   GSV estimation was performed using two methods, the comparison of which
   was a major goal of this study: traditional cross-correlation
   optimisation and a dense image matching algorithm based on complex
   wavelet decomposition. Each method was found to have unique advantages
   and disadvantages, but it was concluded that for GSV monitoring,
   cross-correlation is probably preferable to the wavelet-based approach.
   While it generates fewer estimates per unit area, this is not
   necessarily a critical requirement for all glaciological applications,
   and the method requires less initial ``tuning{''} (calibration) than the
   wavelet algorithm, making it a slightly better tool in operational
   contexts. Also, the use of the highest-resolution spotlight datasets is
   recommended over stripmap mode images when large-area coverage is less
   critical. The comparative lack of visible features at the resolution of
   the stripmap images made reliable GSV estimation difficult, with the
   exception of several small areas dominated by large crevasses. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Some plant families show a striking imbalance in species diversity
   between the Neotropics and the Palaeotropics. The woody plant family
   Chrysobalanaceae is a typical example of this pattern, with 80\% of the
   531 species in the Neotropics. In order to test alternative
   interpretations for this pattern, we generated a dated phylogenetic
   hypothesis for Chrysobalanaceae, using DNA sequence data from one
   nuclear and six plastid markers. Using a maximum likelihood approach, we
   jointly inferred ancestral areas and diversification rates in the
   Neotropics and Palaeotropics. We found that Chrysobalanaceae most
   probably originated in the Palaeotropics about 80?Mya. The family
   dispersed into the Neotropics at least four times beginning 4060?Mya,
   with at least one back-dispersal to the Palaeotropics. Members of
   Chrysobalanaceae have experienced higher extinction, speciation and net
   diversification rates in the Neotropics. Hence, the high species
   diversity of Chrysobalanaceae in the Neotropics appears to be primarily
   caused by a higher speciation rate in this region. Several recent
   studies have shown high diversification rates in Neotropical plant
   families, but have focused on Andean-centred taxa. Ours is the first
   study to find a similar pattern in a family for which the centre of
   diversity is in eastern and central Amazonia. (c) 2012 The Linnean

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{208}},

Abstract = {{Altitudinal changes of composition and richness of montane plant
   assemblages are complex, depending on the taxonomic group and gradient
   conditions, with different factors involved that are directly
   altitude-dependent (e.g., temperatures, air pressure) and
   altitude-independent (e.g., precipitation, cloud cover, area). In order
   to assess the relative impacts of temperature, precipitation, air
   humidity, and area of altitudinal belts on plant diversity, we analyzed
   diversity patterns of five species-rich groups, mostly herbaceous
   plants, in 74 forest plots along three climatically contrasting
   elevational transects from humid tropical lowland vegetation up to cloud
   forests at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We recorded 278 plant species, with
   ferns being the most species-rich group followed by orchids, bromeliads,
   aroids, and piperoids. The most striking results were the contrasting
   patterns and model results for terrestrial and epiphytic taxa. Whereas
   the richness of all terrestrial species taken together did not change
   significantly with elevation, vascular epiphytes showed increasing
   species numbers with altitude. However, a number of individual
   terrestrial taxa showed also significant elevation-related changes:
   aroids showed a marked decline with hight, orchids and piperoids
   increased, and ferns displayed a hump-shaped pattern with highest
   richness in mid-altitudes. Among the epiphytes, aroids declined while
   most other groups increased with altitude. This distinction is relevant
   for projections of responses of plant communities to climate change,
   which will lead to increased temperatures and to changing precipitation
   and cloud condensation regimes and thus will likely affect terrestrial
   and epiphytic species in different ways. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the ice thickness distribution of glaciers and ice caps is
   an important prerequisite for many glaciological and hydrological
   investigations. A wealth of approaches has recently been presented for
   inferring ice thickness from characteristics of the surface. With the
   Ice Thickness Models Intercomparison eXperiment (ITMIX) we performed the
   first coordinated assessment quantifying individual model performance. A
   set of 17 different models showed that individual ice thickness
   estimates can differ considerably - locally by a spread comparable to
   the observed thickness. Averaging the results of multiple models,
   however, significantly improved the results: on average over the 21
   considered test cases, comparison against direct ice thickness
   measurements revealed deviations on the order of 10 +/- 24\% of the mean
   ice thickness (1 sigma estimate). Models relying on multiple data sets -
   such as surface ice velocity fields, surface mass balance, or rates of
   ice thickness change -showed high sensitivity to input data quality.
   Together with the requirement of being able to handle large regions in
   an automated fashion, the capacity of better accounting for
   uncertainties in the input data will be a key for an improved next
   generation of ice thickness estimation approaches.}},

Abstract = {{There is substantial comparative and growing experimental evidence that
   the competition for fertilization among sperm from different males can
   drive variation in male reproductive investments. However, less is known
   about the extent of natural variation in these investments relative to
   environmental variables affecting resource availability and mating
   system dynamics, which would allow insights into the mechanisms shaping
   reproductive allocation. Here, we studied interpopulation variation in
   male investments in testis size and sperm length across 25 populations
   of the Asian grass frog Fejervarya limnocharis along a 1550-km
   latitudinal and 1403-m altitudinal transect in China. We found relative
   testis mass and sperm length, male somatic condition, and the
   male/female sex ratio to increase with elevation but not latitude or
   longitude. Our results suggest that environmental variation may underlie
   local adaptations to reproductive investments among natural populations,
   mediated by differences in the availability of both resources and sexual
   partners (including the resulting male-male competition). These findings
   contrast with previous predictions that increasing latitude and/or
   elevation should lead to declining reproductive investments in male
   anurans due to shortening breeding seasons, declining resource
   availability, and lowering (rather than increasing) male/female sex
   ratios. We discuss these species differences in the context of
   differential resource allocation strategies, breeding ecology, and
   patterns of male-male competition. These differences show the need for
   future work on reproductive investments in anurans beyond the few model
   systems and for potential extension of the theoretical framework to
   species with different mating systems and strategies.
   Despite a broad theoretical framework of how environmental parameters
   can shape mating systems and these, in turn, drive the evolution of
   reproductive traits, there is limited empirical evidence from natural
   populations. We examined differences in the size of testes and sperm
   between males between natural populations along latitudinal and
   altitudinal transects. We found that at high elevation, males were
   relatively heavier and had longer sperm and disproportionately large
   testes, and the sex ratio was more male-biased. These interpopulation
   differences may reflect local adaptations to variation in the resource
   availability and temporal patterns of female availability, which affects
   the breeding synchrony, sperm demand, and male-male competition for
   mates and paternity. However, our results differ from previous studies
   of frogs, possibly due to different breeding ecology, which highlights
   the need for further work and potential extension of theoretical
   predictions to non-model anurans.}},

Abstract = {{Starch serves functions that range over a timescale of minutes to years,
   according to the cell type from which it is derived. In guard cells,
   starch is rapidly mobilized by the synergistic action of beta-AMYLASE1
   (BAM1) and alpha-AMYLASE3 (AMY3) to promote stomatal opening. In the
   leaves, starch typically accumulates gradually during the day and is
   degraded at night by BAM3 to support heterotrophic metabolism. During
   osmotic stress, starch is degraded in the light by stress-activated BAM1
   to release sugar and sugar-derived osmolytes. Here, we report that AMY3
   is also involved in stress-induced starch degradation. Recently isolated
   Arabidopsis thaliana amy3 bam1 double mutants are hypersensitive to
   osmotic stress, showing impaired root growth. amy3 bam1 plants close
   their stomata under osmotic stress at similar rates as the wild type but
   fail to mobilize starch in the leaves. C-14 labeling showed that amy3
   bam1 plants have reduced carbon export to the root, affecting osmolyte
   accumulation and root growth during stress. Using genetic approaches, we
   further demonstrate that abscisic acid controls the activity of BAM1 and
   AMY3 in leaves under osmotic stress through the AREB/ABF-SnRK2
   kinase-signaling pathway. We propose that differential regulation and
   isoform subfunctionalization define starch-adaptive plasticity, ensuring
   an optimal carbon supply for continued growth under an ever-changing
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{AimGondwanan vicariance, boreotropical migration and long-distance
   dispersal have been posited as alternative hypotheses explaining the
   tropical distribution patterns and diversifications in many fern groups.
   Here, the historical biogeography of Diplazium is reconstructed to
   evaluate the impact of these biogeographical processes in shaping the
   modern tropical disjunctions.
   LocationWorld-wide with a focus on tropical forest habitats.
   MethodsDivergence times were estimated by analysing nucleotide sequences
   of seven plastid DNA regions (atpA, atpB, matK, rbcL, rps4, rps4-trnS
   and trnL-F) from 123 species of Diplazium and its allied genera, using a
   Bayesian relaxed clock method and three fossil calibrations. The
   ancestral areas were reconstructed using the likelihood
   dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) approach.
   ResultsThe crown group of Diplazium was estimated to have originated in
   Eurasia and undergone an initial diversification in the Northern
   Hemisphere around 41.7Ma {[}95\% highest posterior density (HPD):
   34-49Ma] during the Eocene. Two disjunct events between the Old and New
   World were identified: one in subgenus Diplazium around the
   Eocene-Oligocene boundary (31.2Ma, 95\% HPD: 25-38Ma), and the other in
   subgenus Callipteris during the middle Miocene (12.6Ma, 95\% HPD:
   15-23Ma). Furthermore, Palaeotropical disjunctions in subgenus
   Callipteris are indicative of multiple dispersal events during the
   Miocene.
   Main conclusionsThe evolutionary history of Diplazium involves a variety
   of biogeographical scenarios. Early diversification of Diplazium in the
   Northern Hemisphere during the Eocene corresponds with the migration
   from Eurasia to North America over land bridges as a member of the
   boreotropical flora. The current tropical amphi-Pacific disjunctions in
   subgenus Diplazium can be better explained by the disruption of
   boreotropical belt, however, long-distance dispersal between Eurasia and
   tropical America cannot be ruled out. Island-hopping and trans-Pacific
   dispersals followed by speciation characterize the disjunctions and
   diversifications of subgenus Callipteris during the Neogene. Gondwanan
   vicariance is not supported by any of our results.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of snow, glacier, and rainfall runoff contribution to
   discharge in mountain streams is of major importance for an adequate
   water resource management. Such contributions can be estimated via
   hydrological models, provided that the modeling adequately accounts for
   snow and glacier melt, as well as rainfall runoff. We present a multiple
   data set calibration approach to estimate runoff composition using
   hydrological models with three levels of complexity. For this purpose,
   the code of the conceptual runoff model HBV-light was enhanced to allow
   calibration and validation of simulations against glacier mass balances,
   satellite-derived snow cover area and measured discharge. Three levels
   of complexity of the model were applied to glacierized catchments in
   Switzerland, ranging from 39 to 103 km(2). The results indicate that all
   three observational data sets are reproduced adequately by the model,
   allowing an accurate estimation of the runoff composition in the three
   mountain streams. However, calibration against only runoff leads to
   unrealistic snow and glacier melt rates. Based on these results, we
   recommend using all three observational data sets in order to constrain
   model parameters and compute snow, glacier, and rain contributions.
   Finally, based on the comparison of model performance of different
   complexities, we postulate that the availability and use of different
   data sets to calibrate hydrological models might be more important than
   model complexity to achieve realistic estimations of runoff composition.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Extra-pair reproduction is widely hypothesized to allow females to avoid
   inbreeding with related socially paired males. Consequently, numerous
   field studies have tested the key predictions that extra-pair offspring
   are less inbred than females' alternative within-pair offspring, and
   that the probability of extra-pair reproduction increases with a
   female's relatedness to her socially paired male. However, such studies
   rarely measure inbreeding or relatedness sufficiently precisely to
   detect subtle effects, or consider biases stemming from failure to
   observe inbred offspring that die during early development. Analyses of
   multigenerational song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) pedigree data showed
   that most females had opportunity to increase or decrease the
   coefficient of inbreeding of their offspring through extra-pair
   reproduction with neighboring males. In practice, observed extra-pair
   offspring had lower inbreeding coefficients than females' within-pair
   offspring on average, while the probability of extra-pair reproduction
   increased substantially with the coefficient of kinship between a female
   and her socially paired male. However, simulations showed that such
   effects could simply reflect bias stemming from inbreeding depression in
   early offspring survival. The null hypothesis that extra-pair
   reproduction is random with respect to kinship therefore cannot be
   definitively rejected in song sparrows, and existing general evidence
   that females avoid inbreeding through extra-pair reproduction requires
   reevaluation given such biases.}},

Title = {{Does body mass convey a digestive advantage for large herbivores?}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1127-1134}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. A key concept of body mass (BM) in niche separation of large
   herbivores assumes that the decrease in diet quality inherent to
   increasing BM (due to less selective feeding behaviour) is balanced by a
   simultaneous increase in digestive ability (due to longer retention
   times), resulting in no or less-than-expected reduction in digestibility
   (as measured in the animal as a result of diet quality and digestive
   ability). However, the second part of this concept has been challenged
   recently due to theoretical problems and mismatch with empirical data.
   2. A proxy for digestibility, such as metabolic faecal nitrogen (MFN),
   will comprise both information on diet quality and digestive ability in
   free-ranging animals. In captive animals, if diet is kept constant, such
   a proxy can exclusively indicate digestive ability. Comparing
   free-ranging and captive animals under such conditions, one would expect
   an increase in MFN with BM in captive animals and no relationship
   between these measures in free-ranging animals if BM was related to
   digestive ability. 3. We compared captive ungulates on a consistent
   grass hay diet (17 species; 30-4000kg BM) to a sample of free-ranging
   East African ungulates (19 species; 12-4000kg BM). MFN was used as the
   major proxy for digestibility. 4. In captive animals, there was no
   influence of BM on MFN (P=0466); for free-ranging animals, a significant
   decreasing effect of body mass on MFN (P=0002) and therefore diet
   quality was found at a scaling of BM-015. 5. In conclusion, scenarios
   that assume a compensation of the evident decrease in diet quality with
   BM via an increased digestive ability are not supported by this study.
   This does not rule out other feeding-related factors in facilitating
   large BM, such as compensation by an increased diet intake.}},

Abstract = {{To study paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic changes in loess-paleosol
   sequences (LPS), most proxies except for screening parameters have often
   been applied at low sampling density, typically 1-2 per stratigraphic
   unit. This might lead to results that overlook paleovegetation effects
   that were not only restricted to paleosols but also affected underlying
   loess material. Here, a new profile was investigated in the
   loess-paleosol sequence (LPS) at Nussloch, SW Germany using a high
   resolution multi-proxy approach to improve our understanding of the Late
   Pleistocene record which serves as a standard sequence in Central
   Europe. This approach included several geophysical and geochemical
   parameters, as well as frequencies of root-related features.
   Grain size distribution and OSL dating enabled correlation of the new
   section with the nearby standard profile P4, revealing considerable
   variations of the thickness of stratigraphic units due to local
   small-scale variations in depositional conditions and paleogeomorphology
   of longitudinal greda structures. Magnetic susceptibility revealed
   weathering of the entire LPS under more humid conditions than those
   described for SE European and Chinese LPS. It further enabled a rough
   differentiation between an interval that was influenced by pedogenic
   processes (Lower Pleniglacial to lower part of the Upper Pleniglacial),
   and loess that was not markedly affected by soil formation. Color
   measurements confirmed these results and enabled the identification of
   several paleosols in the Upper Pleniglacial. For the uppermost part of
   the LPS, low magnetic susceptibility and inorganic geochemical
   parameters such as low Fe/Ti ratios indicated only weak or no pedogenic
   influence. In contrast, considerable variations e.g. in carbonatic
   carbon contents and organic carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio might be related
   to the high frequency of calcified root remains (up to 200 rhizoliths
   m(-2) and up to 12,500 microrhizoliths m(-2)) in certain depth intervals
   of the LPS, entailing incorporation and degradation of organic matter.
   Frequencies of biopores, which are suggested to derive largely from
   former root growth and, to a lesser extent, from insect and earthworm
   bioturbation, were related to paleosols, and thus confirmed the
   pedostratigraphy.
   An improved assessment of terrestrial sedimentary archives can be
   achieved by high-resolution multi-proxy analysis and three-dimensional
   investigation of terrestrial sediments that are prone to bioturbation.

Title = {{Different Mechanisms Are Responsible for Chlorophyll Dephytylation

Abstract = {{Chlorophyll breakdown occurs in different green plant tissues (e. g.
   during leaf senescence and in ripening fruits). For different plant
   species, the PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE (PAO)/phyllobilin pathway has been
   described to be the major chlorophyll catabolic pathway. In this
   pathway, pheophorbide (i. e. magnesium-and phytol-free chlorophyll)
   occurs as a core intermediate. Most of the enzymes involved in the
   PAO/phyllobilin pathway are known; however, the mechanism of
   dephytylation remains uncertain. During Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
   thaliana) leaf senescence, phytol hydrolysis is catalyzed by
   PHEOPHYTINASE (PPH), which is specific for pheophytin (i. e.
   magnesium-free chlorophyll). By contrast, in fruits of different Citrus
   spp., chlorophyllase, hydrolyzing phytol from chlorophyll, was shown to
   be active. Here, we enlighten the process of chlorophyll breakdown in
   tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), both in leaves and fruits. We demonstrate
   the activity of the PAO/phyllobilin pathway and identify tomato PPH
   (SlPPH), which, like its Arabidopsis ortholog, was specifically active
   on pheophytin. SlPPH localized to chloroplasts and was transcriptionally
   up-regulated during leaf senescence and fruit ripening. SlPPH-silencing
   tomato lines were impaired in chlorophyll breakdown and accumulated
   pheophytin during leaf senescence. However, although pheophytin
   transiently accumulated in ripening fruits of SlPPH-silencing lines,
   ultimately these fruits were able to degrade chlorophyll like the wild
   type. We conclude that PPH is the core phytol-hydrolytic enzyme during
   leaf senescence in different plant species; however, fruit ripening
   involves other hydrolases, which are active in parallel to PPH or are
   the core hydrolases in fruits. These hydrolases remain unidentified, and
   we discuss the question of whether chlorophyllases might be involved.}},

Title = {{A Bayesian object-based approach for estimating vegetation biophysical
   and biochemical variables from APEX at-sensor radiance data}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{6-17}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Vegetation variables such as leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll
   content (Cab) are important inputs for vegetation growth models. LAI and
   Cab can be estimated from remote sensing data using either empirical or
   physically-based approaches. The latter are more generally applicable
   because they can easily be adapted to different sensors, acquisition
   geometries, and vegetation types. They estimate vegetation variables
   through inversion of radiative transfer models. Such inversions are
   ill-posed but can be regularized by coupling models, by using a priori
   information, and spatial and/or temporal constraints. Striving to
   improve the accuracy of LAI and Cab estimates from single remote sensing
   images, this contribution proposes a Bayesian object-based approach to
   invert at-sensor radiance data, combining the strengths of
   regularization by model coupling, as well as using a priori data and
   object-level spatial constraints.
   The approach was applied to a study area consisting of homogeneous
   agricultural fields, which were used as objects for applying the spatial
   constraints. LAI and Cab were estimated from at-sensor radiance data of
   the Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer by inverting
   the coupled SLC-MODTRAN4 canopy-atmosphere model. The estimation was
   implemented in two steps. In the first step, up to six variables were
   estimated for each object using a Bayesian optimization algorithm. In
   the second step, a look-up-table (WT) was built for each object with
   only LAI and Cab as free variables, constraining the values of all other
   variables to the values obtained in the first step. The results
   indicated that the Bayesian object-based approach estimated LAI more
   accurately (R-2 = 0.45 and RMSE = 1.0) than a LUT with a Bayesian cost
   function (LUT-BCF) approach (R-2 = 022 and RMSE = 2.1), and Cab with a
   smaller absolute bias (-9 versus -23 mu g/cm(2)).
   The results of this study are an important contribution to further
   improve the regularization of ill-posed RT model inversions. The
   proposed approach allows reducing uncertainties of estimated vegetation
   variables, which is essential to support various environmental
   applications. The definition of objects and a priori data in cases where
   less extensive ground data are available, as well as the definition of
   the observation covariance matrix, are critical issues which require
   further research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{After the Swiss government's decision to decommission its five nuclear
   power plants by 2035, energy production from wind, biomass, biogas and
   photovoltaic is expected to increase significantly. Due to its many
   aspects of a direct democracy, high levels of public acceptance are
   necessary if a substantial increase in new renewable energy power plants
   is to be achieved in Switzerland. A survey of 502 citizens living near
   19 biogas plants was conducted as the basis for using structural
   equation modeling to measure the effects of perceived benefits,
   perceived costs, trust towards the plant operator, perceived smell,
   information received and participation options on citizens' acceptance
   of ``their{''} biogas plant. Results show that local acceptance towards
   existing biogas power plants is relatively high in Switzerland.
   Perceived benefits and costs as well as trust towards the plant operator
   are highly correlated and have a significant effect on local acceptance.
   While smell perception and information received had a significant effect
   on local acceptance as well, no such effect was found for participation
   options. Reasons for the non-impact of participation options on local
   acceptance are discussed, and pathways for future research are
   presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A gradual reduction in the stability of steep bedrock slopes is
   recognized as one potential impact of warming in high mountain regions.
   Recently, consideration has turned to the potential direct role of
   extremely warm temperatures in triggering rockfalls. We provide here a
   first systematic assessment of the timing of 53 recent rockfalls
   relative to defined seasonal extremes of daily maximum air temperature.
   Rockfall observations from the Swiss Alps, Mont Blanc Massif, and
   Southern Alps of New Zealand, are combined with climate analyses based
   on the nearest available long-term records. At four high elevation
   climate stations in Switzerland, there has been significant warming
   across all quantiles of daily maximum temperature during the spring and
   summer months, with corresponding increases in both the frequency and
   magnitude of extremely warm days, and generally less warming (even
   cooling) during winter and autumn. In the same region, an unusually high
   occurrence of extremely warm days occurring in the week leading up to
   rockfalls has been observed over recent decades, with 14 out of 24
   rockfalls preceded by one or more extremely warm days. At the
   neighboring Mont Blanc Massif, based on only two years of observations,
   few rockfalls can be linked to extremely warm temperatures, although an
   early and extremely warm onset of seasonal thawing in spring 2007 may
   have contributed to the large number of rockfalls observed that same
   summer. In the Southern Alps of New Zealand, the available evidence
   provides no basis to suggest extremely warm temperatures have triggered
   unusual rockfall activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Amphibian chytridiomycosis, caused by the chytrid fungus
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is an emerging infectious disease
   that widely threatens amphibian biodiversity. However, population-level
   outcomes following the introduction of the pathogen are highly context
   dependent and are mediated by a broad suite of biotic and abiotic
   variables. Here, we examine the effect of the introduction of Bd on
   native island populations of the IUCN red-listed amphibian species
   Alytes muletensis, the Mallorcan midwife toad. We show that the outcome
   of pathogen introduction is not only dependent on biotic factors, but is
   also dependent on environmental factors that vary across local scales.
   Our experimental infections confirm that the genotype of Bd occurring on
   Mallorca is hypovirulent in A. muletensis when compared against the
   lineage found occurring on mainland Iberia. Long-term population data
   show that A. muletensis populations on the island are increasing
   overall, but trends in highly infected populations are conflicting. We
   use mathematical models and field data to demonstrate that this
   divergence in population response to infection can be explained by local
   environmental differences between infected sites, whereas pathogen
   genetics, host genetics, and intrinsic epidemiological dynamics driven
   by fungal load are less likely to be the cause of these differing
   population trajectories. Our results illustrate the need to take into
   account the appropriate environmental scale and context when assessing
   the risk that an emerging pathogen presents to a naive population or

Abstract = {{To understand how genetic architecture translates between phenotypic
   levels, we mapped the genetic architecture of growth and defense within
   the Arabidopsis thaliana Kas x Tsu recombinant inbred line population.
   We measured plant growth using traditional size measurements and
   size-corrected growth rates. This population contains genetic variation
   in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes, allowing us to separate
   their contributions. The cytoplasmic genome regulated a significant
   variance in growth but not defense, which was due to cytonuclear
   epistasis. Furthermore, growth adhered to an infinitesimal model of
   genetic architecture, while defense metabolism was more of a
   moderate-effect model. We found a lack of concordance between
   quantitative trait loci (QTL) regulating defense and those regulating
   growth. Given the published evidence proving the link between
   glucosinolates and growth, this is likely a false negative result caused
   by the limited population size. This size limitation creates an
   inability to test the entire potential genetic landscape possible
   between these two parents. We uncovered a significant effect of
   glucosinolates on growth once we accounted for allelic differences in
   growth QTLs. Therefore, other growth QTLs can mask the effects of
   defense upon growth. Investigating direct links across phenotypic
   hierarchies is fraught with difficulty; we identify issues complicating
   this analysis.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{A new Swiss TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) electricity model
   with an hourly representation of inter-temporal detail and a
   century-long model horizon has been developed to explore the TIMES
   framework's suitability as a long-term electricity dispatch model. To
   understand the incremental insights from this hourly model, it is
   compared to an aggregated model with only two diurnal timeslices like in
   most MARKAL/TIMES models. Two scenarios have been analysed with both
   models to answer the following questions: Are there differences in model
   solutions? What are the benefits of having a high number of timeslices?
   Are there any computational limitations? The primary objective of this
   paper is to understand the differences between the solutions of the two
   models, rather than Swiss policy implication or potential uncertainties
   in input parameters and assumptions. The analysis reveals that the
   hourly model offers powerful insights into the electricity generation
   schedule. Nevertheless, the TIMES framework cannot substitute for a
   dispatch model because some features cannot be represented; however, the
   long model time horizon and integrated system approaches of TIMES
   provide features not available in conventional dispatch models. The
   methodology of the model development and insights from the model
   comparison are described.}},

Abstract = {{Physical barriers contribute to habitat fragmentation, influence species
   distribution and ranging behaviour, and impact long-term population
   viability. Barrier permeability varies among species and can potentially
   impact the competitive balance within animal communities by
   differentially affecting co-occurring species. The influence of barriers
   on the spatial distribution of species within whole communities has
   nonetheless received little attention. During a 4-year period, we
   studied the influence of a fence and rivers, two landscape features that
   potentially act as barriers on space use and ranging behaviour of lions
   Panthera leo, spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta, African wild dogs Lycaon
   pictus and cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus in Northern Botswana. We compared
   the tendencies of these species to cross the barriers using data
   generated from GPS-radio collars fitted to a total of 35 individuals.
   Barrier permeability was inferred by calculating the number of times
   animals crossed a barrier vs. the number of times they did not cross.
   Finally, based on our results, we produced a map of connectivity for the
   broader landscape system. Permeability varied significantly between
   fence and rivers and among species. The fence represented an obstacle
   for lions (permeability=7 center dot 2\%), while it was considerably
   more permeable for hyenas (35 center dot 6\%) and wild dogs and cheetahs
   (50\%). In contrast, the rivers and associated floodplains were
   relatively permeable to lions (14 center dot 4\%) while they represented
   a nearly impassable obstacle for the other species (<2\%). The aversion
   of lions to cross the fence resulted in a relatively lion-free habitat
   patch on one side of the fence, which might provide a potential refuge
   for other species. For instance, the competitively inferior wild dogs
   used this refuge significantly more intensively than the side of the
   fence with a high presence of lions. We showed that the influence of a
   barrier on the distribution of animals could potentially result in a
   broad-scale modification of community structure and ecology within a
   guild of co-occurring species. As habitat fragmentation increases,
   understanding the impact of barriers on species distributions is thus
   essential for the implementation of landscape-scale management
   strategies, the development and maintenance of corridors and the
   enhancement of connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging interactions are key determinants of system productivity and

   planktonic microbial assemblages is unknown. We studied the relationship
   between two aquatic bacterial strains and a protistan predator with
   respect to cooperation and system efficiency. While competitive
   exclusion of one bacterial strain was observed in grazer-free
   cocultures, the presence of the predator induced the formation of large
   coaggregates and allowed a coexistence of both strains. The aggregates
   moreover provided a substrate for attachment of the predators. The
   interactions in the more complex community, i.e., microbial flocs
   composed by both bacterial strains and predators, led to a significantly
   increased transfer efficiency of dissolved organic matter to the higher
   trophic level than in systems with two species only. Similar emerging
   interactions might also play a role in complex microbial assemblages in
   natural aquatic systems, i.e., on suspended organic aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{Modifications in temperature and precipitation due to climate change
   will likely affect carbon cycling and soil respiration in terrestrial
   ecosystems. Despite the important feedback mechanism of ecosystems to
   climate change, there is still a lack of experimental observation in
   agricultural ecosystems. In July 2008, we established the Hohenheim
   Climate Change (HoCC) experiment to investigate effects of elevated
   temperature and altered precipitation on soil respiration in an arable
   soil (mean annual temperature and precipitation 8.7 degrees C and 679
   mm, respectively). We elevated soil temperature to 4 cm depth by 2.5
   degrees C, reduced the amount of summer precipitation by 25\%, and
   extended dry intervals between precipitation events. For two years, CO2
   fluxes were measured weekly and aboveground plant biomass and soil
   microbial biomass was determined. The results of the two-year study
   underline the importance of soil moisture as a driving factor in
   ecosystem response to climate change. Soil warming did not increase soil
   respiration in the first year; in the second year, a 27\% increase was
   measured. The differential response of soil respiration to warming was
   most likely driven by soil moisture. In summer 2009, water limitation
   reduced microbial biomass in the heated plots thereby suppressing the
   stimulatory effect of elevated temperature on soil microorganisms. In
   summer 2010, the reduction in soil moisture was less pronounced and
   microbial biomass and respiration were not affected by water limitation.
   Temperature elevation significantly reduced Q(10) values of soil
   respiration by 0.7-0.8. Altered precipitation showed only minor effects
   during the first two years of the experiment We conclude from our study
   that the moisture regime of soils under elevation of temperature will
   largely determine whether different soils will serve either as carbon
   sources or as carbon sinks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The genomic revolution has fundamentally changed how we survey
   biodiversity on earth. High-throughput sequencing ({''}HTS{''})
   platforms now enable the rapid sequencing of DNA from diverse kinds of
   environmental samples (termed ``environmental DNA{''} or ``eDNA{''}).
   Coupling HTS with our ability to associate sequences from eDNA with a
   taxonomic name is called ``eDNA metabarcoding{''} and offers a powerful
   molecular tool capable of noninvasively surveying species richness from
   many ecosystems. Here, we review the use of eDNA metabarcoding for
   surveying animal and plant richness, and the challenges in using eDNA
   approaches to estimate relative abundance. We highlight eDNA
   applications in freshwater, marine and terrestrial environments, and in
   this broad context, we distill what is known about the ability of
   different eDNA sample types to approximate richness in space and across
   time. We provide guiding questions for study design and discuss the eDNA
   metabarcoding workflow with a focus on primers and library preparation
   methods. We additionally discuss important criteria for consideration of
   bioinformatic filtering of data sets, with recommendations for
   increasing transparency. Finally, looking to the future, we discuss
   emerging applications of eDNA metabarcoding in ecology, conservation,
   invasion biology, biomonitoring, and how eDNA metabarcoding can empower
   citizen science and biodiversity education.}},

Abstract = {{Impacts of human civilization on ecosystems threaten global
   biodiversity. In a changing environment, traditional in situ approaches
   to biodiversity monitoring have made significant steps forward to
   quantify and evaluate BD at many scales but still, these methods are
   limited to comparatively small areas. Earth observation (EO) techniques
   may provide a solution to overcome this shortcoming by measuring
   entities of interest at different spatial and temporal scales.
   This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the role of EO to
   detect, describe, explain, predict and assess biodiversity. Here, we
   focus on three main aspects related to biodiversity taxonomic diversity,
   functional diversity and structural diversity, which integrate different
   levels of organization molecular, genetic, individual, species,
   populations, communities, biomes, ecosystems and landscapes. In
   particular, we discuss the recording of taxonomic elements of
   biodiversity through the identification of animal and plant species. We
   highlight the importance of the spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait
   variations (STV) concept for EO-based biodiversity research. Furthermore
   we provide examples of spectral traits/spectral trait variations used in
   EO applications for quantifying taxonomic diversity, functional
   diversity and structural diversity. We discuss the use of EO to monitor
   biodiversity and habitat quality using different remote-sensing
   techniques. Finally, we suggest specifically important steps for a
   better integration of EO in biodiversity research.
   EO methods represent an affordable, repeatable and comparable method for
   measuring, describing, explaining and modelling taxonomic, functional
   and structural diversity. Upcoming sensor developments will provide
   opportunities to quantify spectral traits, currently not detectable with
   EO, and will surely help to describe biodiversity in more detail.
   Therefore, new concepts are needed to tightly integrate EO sensor
   networks with the identification of biodiversity. This will mean taking
   completely new directions in the future to link complex, large data,
   different approaches and models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Substantial amounts of nutrients are lost from soils via leaching and as

   expensive in terms of lost agricultural production. Plants have evolved
   many traits to optimize nutrient acquisition, including the formation of
   arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), associations of plant roots with fungi that
   acquire soil nutrients. There is emerging evidence that AM have the
   ability to reduce nutrient loss from soils by enlarging the nutrient
   interception zone and preventing nutrient loss after rain-induced
   leaching events. Until recently, this important ecosystem service of AM
   had been largely overlooked. Here we review the role of AM in reducing
   nutrient loss and conclude that this role cannot be ignored if we are to
   increase global food production in an environmentally sustainable

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{133}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Maintenance of the agricultural landscape, preservation of biodiversity
   and landscape aesthetics are part of a multifunctional agriculture.
   However, little is known about the influence of single agricultural
   landscape elements in different seasonal stages on landscape aesthetics.
   In a Swisswide photo survey, the aesthetic preferences of Swiss
   residents for typical agricultural landscape elements in the Swiss
   lowlands were investigated. Photographs of seven ecological compensation
   areas (ECAs) and seven other elements (crops, high-intensity meadows and
   pastures) were selected. Each element was presented in four to six
   different seasonal stages, each on single paper-based questionnaire
   pages to allow a random selection of elements and seasonal stages. In
   addition, each element was replicated in each seasonal stage. Four
   randomly selected elements were sent to each study participant for
   aesthetic valuation (preference rating scores). Overall, ECAs received
   higher preference ratings than crops or high-intensity grassland. Most
   preferred were ECAs with a vertical structure, i.e. trees and bushes,
   and species-rich elements. In addition, the seasonal stage of a
   landscape element strongly influenced preference ratings. Flowering
   stages were clearly liked most. Moreover, perceived diversity and
   naturalness of an element had a strong positive effect on its rating.
   The results indicate that ECAs, besides their ecological function, are
   powerful elements to enhance the public's preference for agricultural
   landscapes. Moreover, the results might be useful for the development
   and adaptation of quantitative methods to capture the aesthetic value of
   agricultural regions and might provide a basis for political decisions
   concerning direct payments for aesthetic services of agriculture. (C)

Abstract = {{Adaptive radiation (AR) is a key process in the origin of organismal
   diversity. However, the evolution of trait disparity in connection with
   ecological specialization is still poorly understood. Available models
   for vertebrate ARs predict that diversification occurs in the form of
   temporal stages driven by different selective forces. Here, we
   investigate the AR of cichlid fishes in East African Lake Tanganyika and
   use macroevolutionary model fitting to evaluate whether diversification
   happened in temporal stages. Six trait complexes, for which we also
   provide evidence of their adaptiveness, are analysed with comparative
   methods: body shape, pharyngeal jaw shape, gill raker traits, gut

   evidence for the `stages model' of AR. However, our results suggest that
   trophic traits diversify earlier than traits implicated in macrohabitat
   adaptation and that sexual communication traits (i.e. coloration)
   diversify late in the radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Insect herbivores trigger various biochemical changes in plants, and as
   a consequence, affect other organisms that are associated with these
   plants. Such plant-mediated indirect effects often involve
   herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that can be used as cues for
   foraging herbivores and their natural enemies, and are also known to
   affect pollinator attraction. In tightly co-evolved systems, the
   different trophic levels are expected to display adaptive response to
   changes in HIPVs caused by native herbivores. But what if a new
   herbivore invades such a system? Current literature suggests that exotic
   herbivores have the potential to affect HIPV production, and that plant
   responses to novel herbivores are likely to depend on phylogenetic
   relatedness between the invader and the native species. Here we review
   the different ways exotic herbivores can disrupt chemically mediated
   interactions between plants and the key users of HIPVs: herbivores,
   pollinators, and members of the third (i.e. predators and parasitoids)
   and fourth (i.e. hyperparasitoids) trophic levels. Current theory on
   insect invasions needs to consider that disruptive effects of invaders
   on infochemical networks can have a short-term impact on the population
   dynamics of native insects and plants, as well as exerting potentially
   negative consequences for the functioning of native ecosystems.}},

Title = {{The sucrose transporter SlSUT2 from tomato interacts with

Journal = {{PLANT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},

Abstract = {{Mycorrhizal plants benefit from the fungal partners by getting better
   access to soil nutrients. In exchange, the plant supplies carbohydrates
   to the fungus. The additional carbohydrate demand in mycorrhizal plants
   was shown to be balanced partially by higher CO2 assimilation and
   increased C metabolism in shoots and roots. In order to test the role of
   sucrose transport for fungal development in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
   tomato, transgenic plants with down-regulated expression of three
   sucrose transporter genes were analysed. Plants that carried an
   antisense construct of SlSUT2 (SlSUT2as) repeatedly exhibited increased
   mycorrhizal colonization and the positive effect of plants to mycorrhiza
   was abolished. Grafting experiments between transgenic and wild-type
   rootstocks and scions indicated that mainly the root-specific function
   of SlSUT2 has an impact on colonization of tomato roots with the AM
   fungus. Localization of SISUT2 to the periarbuscular membrane indicates
   a role in back transport of sucrose from the periarbuscular matrix into
   the plant cell thereby affecting hyphal development. Screening of an
   expression library for SlSUT2-interacting proteins revealed interactions
   with candidates involved in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling or
   biosynthesis. Interaction of these candidates with SlSUT2 was confirmed
   by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Tomato mutants defective in
   BR biosynthesis were analysed with respect to mycorrhizal symbiosis and
   showed indeed decreased mycorrhization. This finding suggests that BRs
   affect mycorrhizal infection and colonization. If the inhibitory effect
   of SlSUT2 on mycorrhizal growth involves components of BR synthesis and
   of the BR signaling pathway is discussed.}},

   (LPV) sub-group. OLIVE has three main objectives: (i) to provide a
   consistent and centralized information on the definition of the
   biophysical variables, as well as a description of the main available
   products and their performances (ii) to provide transparency and
   traceability by an online validation procedure compliant with the CEOS

   (iii) and finally, to provide a tool to benchmark new products, update
   product validation results and host new ground measurement sites for
   accuracy assessment. The functionalities and algorithms of OLIVE are
   described to provide full transparency of its procedures to the
   community. The validation process and typical results are illustrated

Title = {{A tale of migrations from east to west: the Irano-Turanian floristic
   region as a source of Mediterranean xerophytes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{366-379}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{AimThe Irano-Turanian (IT) floristic region is characterized by high
   levels of endemicity. Despite its potential role as a cradle of
   xerophytic taxa for neighbouring areas, its biogeographical history
   remains poorly studied. Haplophyllum, a diagnostic element of the IT
   region, was used as a model to discriminate between alternative
   biogeographical scenarios for the evolution of the region and, more
   specifically, to investigate whether it served as a source of xerophytes
   for the colonization of the Mediterranean Basin.
   LocationIrano-Turanian floristic region (Central Asia and West Asiatic
   areas) and Mediterranean floristic region (western and eastern parts of
   the Mediterranean Basin).
   MethodsThree chloroplast DNA regions were sequenced in 77 accessions of
   Haplophyllum and 37 accessions from other subfamilies of Rutaceae. To
   elucidate the temporal and spatial evolution of Haplophyllum in the IT
   and Mediterranean regions, we performed Bayesian molecular dating
   analyses with four fossil constraints and ancestral range
   reconstructions, respectively.
   ResultsOur molecular dating and ancestral area reconstruction analyses
   suggest that Haplophyllum originated in the Central Asian part of the IT
   region during the early Eocene and started to diversify in situ during
   the early Oligocene, soon after the vanishing of the Tethys Ocean. Our
   results further imply that Haplophyllum later invaded the eastern
   Mediterranean Basin in the middle-to-late Miocene, concomitantly with
   the Paratethys Salinity Crisis and rapid palaeobiogeographical changes
   in the proto-Mediterranean. Finally, Haplophyllum diversified in the
   western Mediterranean in the early Pliocene at the end of the Messinian
   Salinity Crisis.
   Main conclusionsThe IT floristic region can serve as a donor' of
   xerophytic taxa to recipient' neighbouring regions, including the
   Mediterranean floristic region. The climatic/geological processes during
   the Miocene-Pliocene, by increasing aridity and topographic
   heterogeneity, facilitated range shifts and allopatric speciation in the
   region.}},

Title = {{Bayesian object-based estimation of LAI and chlorophyll from a simulated
   Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere radiance image}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{318-329}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (Cab) are important
   vegetation variables which can be monitored using remote sensing (RS).
   Physically-based approaches have higher transferability and are
   therefore better suited than empirically-based approaches for estimating
   LAI and Cab at global scales. These approaches, however, require the
   inversion of radiative transfer (RT) models, which is an ill-posed and
   underdetermined problem. Four regularization methods have been proposed,
   allowing finding stable solutions: 1) model coupling, 2) using a priori
   information (e.g. Bayesian approaches), 3) spatial constraints (e.g.
   using objects), and 4) temporal constraints. For mono-temporal data,
   only the first three methods can be applied.
   In an earlier study, we presented a Bayesian object-based algorithm for
   inverting the SLC-MODTRAN4 coupled canopy-atmosphere RT model, and
   compared it with a Bayesian LUT inversion. The results showed that the
   object-based approach provided more accurate LAI estimates. This study,
   however, heavily relied on expert knowledge about the objects and
   vegetation classes. Therefore, in this new contribution, we investigated
   the applicability of the Bayesian object-based inversion of the
   SLC-MODTRAN4 model to a situation where no such knowledge was available.
   The case study used a 16 x 22 km(2) simulated top-of-atmosphere image of
   the upcoming Sentinel-2 sensor, covering the area near the city of
   Zurich, Switzerland. Seven APEX radiance images were nadir-normalized
   using the parametric Li-Ross model, spectrally and spatially resampled
   to Sentinel-2 specifications, geometrically corrected, and mosaicked.
   The atmospheric effects between APEX flight height and top-of-atmosphere
   level, were added based on two MODTRAN4 simulations. The vegetation
   objects were identified and delineated using a segmentation algorithm,
   and classified in four levels of brightness in the visible domain. The
   LAI and Cab maps obtained from the Bayesian object-based inversion of
   the coupled SLC-MODTRAN4 model presented realistic spatial patterns. The
   impact of the parametric Li-Ross nadir-normalization was evaluated by
   comparing 1) the angular signatures of the SLC-MODTRAN4 and Li-Ross
   models, and 2) the LAI and Cab maps obtained from a Li-Ross
   nadir-normalized image (using nadir viewing geometry) and from the
   original image (using the original viewing geometry). The differences in
   angular signatures were small but systematic, and the differences
   between the LAI and Cab maps increased from the center towards the edges
   of the across-track direction. The results of this study contribute to
   preparing the RS community for the arrival of Sentinel-2 data in the
   near future, and generalize the applicability of the Bayesian
   object-based approach for estimating vegetation variables to cases where
   no field data are available. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR PLANT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{1550-1563}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Here, we compared the highly voltage- and malate-dependent gating
   kinetics of R-/QUAC-type currents of guard cell protoplasts with QUAC1
   expressed in oocytes. Truncations and mutation of QUAC1 indicated that
   the C-terminus is involved in the voltage-dependent gating mechanism of
   QUAC1.Anion transporters in plants play a fundamental role in volume
   regulation and signaling. Currently, two plasma membrane-located anion
   channel familiesuSLAC/SLAH and ALMTuare known. Among the ALMT family,
   the root-expressed ALuminium-activated Malate Transporter 1 was
   identified by comparison of aluminum-tolerant and Al-3-sensitive wheat
   cultivars and was subsequently shown to mediate voltage-independent
   malate currents. In contrast, ALMT12/QUAC1 (QUickly activating Anion
   Channel1) is expressed in guard cells transporting malate in an
   Al-3-insensitive and highly voltage-dependent manner. So far, no
   information is available about the structure and mechanism of
   voltage-dependent gating with the QUAC1 channel protein. Here, we
   analyzed gating of QUAC1-type currents in the plasma membrane of guard
   cells and QUAC1-expressing oocytes revealing similar voltage
   dependencies and activationdeactivation kinetics. In the heterologous
   expression system, QUAC1 was electrophysiologically characterized at
   increasing extra- and intracellular malate concentrations. Thereby,
   malate additively stimulated the voltage-dependent QUAC1 activity. In
   search of structural determinants of the gating process, we could not
   identify transmembrane domains common for voltage-sensitive channels.
   However, site-directed mutations and deletions at the C-terminus of
   QUAC1 resulted in altered voltage-dependent channel activity.
   Interestingly, the replacement of a single glutamate residue, which is
   conserved in ALMT channels from different clades, by an alanine
   disrupted QUAC1 activity. Together with C- and N-terminal tagging, these
   results indicate that the cytosolic C-terminus is involved in the
   voltage-dependent gating mechanism of QUAC1.}},

Title = {{Odour-based kin discrimination in the cooperatively breeding meerkat}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB 23}},
Abstract = {{Kin recognition is a useful ability for animals, facilitating
   cooperation among relatives and avoidance of excessive kin competition
   or inbreeding. In meerkats, Suricata suricatta, encounters between
   unfamiliar kin are relatively frequent, and kin recognition by phenotype
   matching is expected to avoid inbreeding with close relatives. Here, we
   investigate whether female meerkats are able to discriminate the scent
   of unfamiliar kin from unfamiliar non-kin. Dominant females were
   presented with anal gland secretion from unfamiliar individuals that
   varied in their relatedness. Our result indicates that females spent
   more time investigating the scent of related than unrelated unfamiliar
   individuals, suggesting that females may use a phenotype matching
   mechanism (or recognition alleles) to discriminate the odour of their
   kin from the odour of their non-kin. Our study provides a key starting
   point for further investigations into the use of kin recognition for
   inbreeding avoidance in the widely studied meerkat.}},

   also characteristic of the period before 2000. Surge-type and

   processes underlying species radiations and patterns of biodiversity.
   Here we investigated the radiation of sexually deceptive bee orchids
   (Ophrys). Based on a time-calibrated phylogeny and by means of ancestral
   character reconstruction and divergence time estimation, we estimated
   the tempo and mode of this radiation within a state-dependent
   evolutionary framework. It appears that, in the Pleistocene, the
   evolution of Ophrys was marked by episodes of rapid diversification
   coinciding with shifts to different pollinator types: from wasps to
   Eucera bees to Andrena and other bees. An abrupt increase in net
   diversification rate was detected in three clades. Among these, two
   phylogenetically distant lineages switched from Eucera to Andrena and
   other bees in a parallel fashion and at about the same time in their
   evolutionary history. Lack of early radiation associated with the
   evolution of the key innovation of sexual deception suggests that Ophrys
   diversification was mainly driven by subsequent ecological opportunities
   provided by the exploitation of novel pollinator groups, encompassing
   many bee species slightly differing in their sex pheromone communication
   systems, and by spatiotemporal fluctuations in the pollinator mosaic.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape connectivity structure, specifically the dendritic network
   structure of rivers, is expected to influence community diversity
   dynamics by altering dispersal patterns, and subsequently the unfolding
   of species interactions. However, previous comparative and experimental
   work on dendritic metacommunities has studied diversity mostly from an
   equilibrium perspective. Here we investigated the effect of dendritic
   versus linear network structure on local (alpha-diversity), among
   (beta-diversity) and total (gamma-diversity) temporal species community
   diversity dynamics. Using a combination of microcosm experiments, which
   allowed for active dispersal of 14 protists and a rotifer species, and
   numerical analyses, we demonstrate the general importance of spatial
   network configuration and basic life history tradeoffs as driving
   factors of different diversity patterns in linear and dendritic systems.
   We experimentally found that community diversity patterns were shaped by
   the interaction of dispersal within the networks and local species
   interactions. Specifically, alpha-diversity remained higher in dendritic
   networks over time, especially at highly connected sites. beta-diversity
   was initially greater in linear networks, due to increased dispersal
   limitation, but became more similar to beta-diversity in dendritic
   networks over time. Comparing the experimental results with a neutral
   metacommunity model we found that dispersal and network connectivity
   alone may, to a large extent, explain alpha- and beta-diversity
   dynamics. However, additional mechanisms, such as variation in carrying
   capacity and competition-colonization tradeoffs, were needed in the
   model to capture the detailed temporal diversity dynamics of the
   experiments, such as a general decline in gamma-diversity and long-term
   dynamics in alpha-diversity.}},

Title = {{Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat extensin (LRX) proteins modify cell wall
   composition and influence plant growth}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are extracellular
   proteins consisting of an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain
   and a C-terminal extensin domain containing the typical features of this
   class of structural hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs). The LRR
   domain is likely to bind an interaction partner, whereas the extensin
   domain has an anchoring function to insolubilize the protein in the cell
   wall. Based on the analysis of the root hair-expressed LRX1 and LRX2 of
   Arabidopsis thaliana, LRX proteins are important for cell wall
   development. The importance of LRX proteins in non-root hair cells and
   on the structural changes induced by mutations in LRX genes remains
   elusive.
   Results: The LRX gene family of Arabidopsis consists of eleven members,
   of which LRX3, LRX4, and LRX5 are expressed in aerial organs, such as
   leaves and stem. The importance of these LRX genes for plant development
   and particularly cell wall formation was investigated. Synergistic
   effects of mutations with gradually more severe growth retardation
   phenotypes in double and triple mutants suggest a similar function of
   the three genes. Analysis of cell wall composition revealed a number of
   changes to cell wall polysaccharides in the mutants.
   Conclusions: LRX3, LRX4, and LRX5, and most likely LRX proteins in
   general, are important for cell wall development. Due to the complexity
   of changes in cell wall structures in the lrx mutants, the exact
   function of LRX proteins remains to be determined. The increasingly
   strong growth-defect phenotypes in double and triple mutants suggests
   that the LRX proteins have similar functions and that they are important
   for proper plant development.}},

Abstract = {{Drought regimes can be characterized by the variability in the quantity
   of rainfall and the duration of rainless periods. However, most research
   on plant response to drought has ignored the impacts of rainfall
   variation, especially with regard to the influence of nonstructural
   carbohydrates (NSCs) in promoting drought resistance. To test the
   hypothesis that these components of drought differentially affect NSC
   dynamics and seedling resistance, we tracked NSC in plant tissues of
   tropical tree seedlings in response to manipulations of the volume and
   frequency of water applied. NSC concentrations decreased in woody
   tissues under infrequent-high watering but increased under no watering.
   A faster decline of growth relative to stomatal conductance in the no
   watering treatment was consistent with NSC accumulation as a result of
   an uncoupling of growth and photosynthesis, while usage of stored NSCs
   in woody tissues to maintain function may account for the NSC decline
   under infrequent-high watering. NSCs, and specifically stem NSCs,
   contributed to drought resistance under severe water deficits, while
   NSCs had a less clear role in drought resistance to variability in water
   availability. The contrasting response of NSCs to water variability and
   deficit indicates that unique processes support seedling resistance to
   these components of drought.}},

Abstract = {{The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is the most widely used index
   to characterize droughts that are related to precipitation deficiencies.
   However, the SPI does not always deliver the relevant information for
   hydrological drought management particularly in snow-influenced
   catchments. If precipitation is temporarily stored as snow, then there
   is a significant difference between meteorological and hydrological
   drought because the delayed release of melt water to the stream. We
   introduce an extension to the SPI, the Standardized Snow Melt and Rain
   Index (SMRI), that accounts for rain and snow melt deficits, which
   effectively influence streamflow. The SMRI can be derived without snow
   data, using temperature and precipitation to model snow. The value of
   the new index is illustrated for seven Swiss catchments with different
   degrees of snow influence. In particular for catchments with a larger
   component of snowmelt in runoff generation, the SMRI was found to be a
   worthwhile complementary index to the SPI to characterize streamflow
   droughts.}},

Abstract = {{The development of high-yielding varieties with broad-spectrum durable
   disease resistance is the ultimate goal of crop breeding. In plants,
   immune receptors of the nucleotide-binding-leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR)
   class mediate race-specific resistance against pathogen attack. When
   employed in agriculture this type of resistance is often rapidly
   overcome by newly adapted pathogen races. The stacking of different
   resistance genes or alleles in F1 hybrids or in pyramided lines is a
   promising strategy for achieving more durable resistance. Here, we
   identify a molecular mechanism which can negatively interfere with the
   allele-pyramiding approach. We show that pairwise combinations of
   different alleles of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm3 in F1
   hybrids and stacked transgenic wheat lines can result in suppression of
   Pm3-based resistance. This effect is independent of the genetic
   background and solely dependent on the Pm3 alleles. Suppression occurs
   at the post-translational level, as levels of RNA and protein in the
   suppressed alleles are unaffected. Using a transient expression system
   in Nicotiana benthamiana, the LRR domain was identified as the domain
   conferring suppression. The results of this study suggest that the
   expression of closely related NB-LRR resistance genes or alleles in the
   same genotype can lead to dominant-negative interactions. These findings
   provide a molecular explanation for the frequently observed
   ineffectiveness of resistance genes introduced from the secondary gene
   pool into polyploid crop species and mark an important step in
   overcoming this limitation.}},

Abstract = {{Plant autophagy, one of the essential proteolysis systems, balances
   proteome and nutrient levels in cells of the whole plant. Autophagy has
   been studied by analysing Arabidopsis thaliana autophagy-defective atg
   mutants, but the relationship between autophagy and chlorophyll (Chl)
   breakdown during stress-induced leaf yellowing remains unclear. During
   natural senescence or under abiotic-stress conditions, extensive cell
   death and early yellowing occurs in the leaves of atg mutants. A new
   finding is revealed that atg5 and atg7 mutants exhibit a functional
   stay-green phenotype under mild abiotic-stress conditions, but leaf
   yellowing proceeds normally in wild-type leaves under these conditions.
   Under mild salt stress, atg5 leaves retained high levels of Chls and all
   photosystem proteins and maintained a normal chloroplast structure.
   Furthermore, a double mutant of atg5 and non-functional stay-green
   nonyellowing1-1 (atg5 nye1-1) showed a much stronger stay-green
   phenotype than either single mutant. Taking these results together, it
   is proposed that autophagy functions in the non-selective catabolism of
   Chls and photosynthetic proteins during stress-induced leaf yellowing,
   in addition to the selective degradation of Chl-apoprotein complexes in
   the chloroplasts through the senescence-induced STAY-GREEN1/NYE1 and Chl
   catabolic enzymes.}},

Title = {{Does polyploidy facilitate long-distance dispersal?}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims The ability of plant lineages to reach all
   continents contributes substantially to their evolutionary success. This
   is exemplified by the Poaceae, one of the most successful angiosperm
   families, in which most higher taxa (tribes, subfamilies) have global
   distributions. Due to the old age of the ocean basins relative to the
   major angiosperm radiations, this is only possible by means of
   long-distance dispersal (LDD), yet the attributes of lineages with
   successful LDD remain obscure. Polyploid species are over-represented in
   invasive floras and in the previously glaciated Arctic regions, and
   often have wider ecological tolerances than diploids; thus polyploidy is
   a candidate attribute of successful LDD.
   Methods The link between polyploidy and LDD was explored in the globally
   distributed grass subfamily Danthonioideae. An almost completely sampled
   and well-resolved species-level phylogeny of the danthonioids was used,
   and the available cytological information was assembled. The cytological
   evolution in the clade was inferred using maximum likelihood (ML) as
   implemented in ChromEvol. The biogeographical evolution in the clade was
   reconstructed using ML and Bayesian approaches.
   Key Results Numerous increases in ploidy level are demonstrated. A Late
   Miocene-Pliocene cycle of polyploidy is associated with LDD, and in two
   cases (the Australian Rytidosperma and the American Danthonia) led to
   secondary polyploidy. While it is demonstrated that successful LDD is
   more likely in polyploid than in diploid lineages, a link between
   polyploidization events and LDD is not demonstrated.
   Conclusions The results suggest that polyploids are more successful at
   LDD than diploids, and that the frequent polyploidy in the grasses might
   have facilitated the extensive dispersal among continents in the family,
   thus contributing to their evolutionary success.}},

Volume = {{281}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous infection by multiple parasite species (viruses, bacteria,
   helminths, protozoa or fungi) is commonplace. Most reports show
   co-infected humans to have worse health than those with single
   infections. However, we have little understanding of how co-infecting
   parasites interact within human hosts. We used data from over 300
   published studies to construct a network that offers the first broad
   indications of how groups of co-infecting parasites tend to interact.
   The network had three levels comprising parasites, the resources they
   consume and the immune responses they elicit, connected by potential,
   observed and experimentally proved links. Pairs of parasite species had
   most potential to interact indirectly through shared resources, rather
   than through immune responses or other parasites. In addition, the
   network comprised 10 tightly knit groups, eight of which were associated
   with particular body parts, and seven of whichwere dominated by
   parasite-resource links. Reported co-infection in humans is therefore
   structured by physical location within the body, with bottom-up,
   resource-mediated processes most often influencing how, where and which
   co-infecting parasites interact. The many indirect interactions
   showhowtreating an infection could affect other infections in
   co-infected patients, but the compartmentalized structure of the network
   will limit how far these indirect effects are likely to spread.}},

Abstract = {{Amphibians are globally threatened, but not all species are affected
   equally by different threatening processes. This is true for the threat
   posed by the chytridiomycete fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). We
   compiled a European data set for B. dendrobatidis to analyze the trends
   of infection in European amphibians. The risk of infection was not
   randomly distributed geographically or taxonomically across Europe.
   Within countries with different prevalence, infection was nonrandom in
   certain amphibian taxa. Brown frogs of the genus Rana were unlikely to
   be infected, whereas frogs in the families Alytidae and Bombinatoridae
   were significantly more likely to be infected than predicted by chance.
   Frogs in the 2 families susceptible to B. dendrobatidis should form the
   core of attempts to develop spatial surveillance studies of
   chytridiomycosis in Europe. Ideally, surveys for B. dendrobatidis should
   be augmented by sampling the widespread genus Pelophylax because this
   taxon exhibits geographically inconsistent overinfection with B.
   dendrobatidis and surveillance of it may facilitate recognition of
   factors causing spatial variability of infection intensity. Several
   European amphibian taxa were not represented in our data set; however,
   surveillance of unsampled species should also occur when warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The higher midlatitudes of the northern hemisphere are particularly
   sensitive to change due to the important role the 0 degrees C isotherm
   plays in the phase of precipitation and intermediate storage as snow. An
   international intercatchment comparison program called North-Watch seeks
   to improve our understanding of the sensitivity of northern catchments
   to change by examining their hydrological and biogeochemical variability
   and response. Here eight North-Watch catchments located in Sweden
   (Krycklan), Scotland (Girnock and Strontian), the United States
   (Sleepers River, Hubbard Brook, and HJ Andrews), and Canada (Dorset and
   Wolf Creek) with 10 continuous years of daily precipitation and runoff
   data were selected to assess daily to seasonal coupling of precipitation
   (P) and runoff (Q) using wavelet coherency, and to explore the patterns
   and scales of variability in streamflow using color maps. Wavelet
   coherency revealed that P and Q were decoupled in catchments with cold
   winters, yet were strongly coupled during and immediately following the
   spring snowmelt freshet. In all catchments, coupling at shorter time
   scales occurred during wet periods when the catchment was responsive and
   storage deficits were small. At longer time scales, coupling reflected
   coherence between seasonal cycles, being enhanced at sites with enhanced
   seasonality in P. Color maps were applied as an alternative method to
   identify patterns and scales of flow variability. Seasonal versus
   transient flow variability was identified along with the persistence of
   that variability on influencing the flow regime. While exploratory in
   nature, this intercomparison exercise highlights the importance of
   climate and the 0 degrees C isotherm on the functioning of northern
   catchments.}},

Abstract = {{Introgression can be an important evolutionary force but it can also
   lead to species extinction and as such is a crucial issue for species
   conservation. However, introgression is difficult to detect,
   morphologically as well as genetically. Hybridization with domestic cats
   (Felis silvestris catus) is a major concern for the conservation of
   European wildcats (Felis s. silvestris). The available morphologic and
   genetic markers for the two Felis subspecies are not sufficient to
   reliably detect hybrids beyond first generation. Here we present a
   single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based approach that allows the
   identification of introgressed individuals. Using high-throughput
   sequencing of reduced representation libraries we developed a diagnostic
   marker set containing 48 SNPs (Fst>0.8) which allows the identification
   of wildcats, domestic cats, their hybrids and backcrosses. This allows
   assessing introgression rate in natural wildcat populations and is key
   for a better understanding of hybridization processes.}},

Title = {{New support for an old hypothesis: density affects extra-pair paternity}},

Abstract = {{Density has been suggested to affect variation in extra-pair paternity
   (EPP) in avian mating systems, because increasing density promotes
   encounter rates and thus mating opportunities. However, the significance
   of density affecting EPP variation in intra- and interspecific
   comparisons has remained controversial, with more support from
   intraspecific comparisons. Neither experimental nor empirical studies
   have consistently provided support for the density hypothesis. Testing
   the density hypothesis is challenging because density measures may not
   necessarily reflect extra-pair mating opportunities, mate guarding
   efforts may covary with density, populations studied may differ in
   migratory behavior and/or climatic conditions, and variation in density
   may be insufficient. Accounting for these potentially confounding
   factors, we tested whether EPP rates within and among subpopulations of
   the reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) were related to density. Our
   analyses were based on data from 13 subpopulations studied over 4 years.
   Overall, 56.4\% of totally 181 broods contained at least one extra-pair
   young (EPY) and 37.1\% of totally 669 young were of extra-pair origin.
   Roughly 90\% of the extra-pair fathers were from the adjacent territory
   or from the territory after the next one. Within subpopulations, the
   proportion of EPY in broods was positively related to local breeding
   density. Similarly, among subpopulations, proportion of EPY was
   positively associated with population density. EPP was absent in
   subpopulations consisting of single breeding pairs, that is, without
   extra-pair mating opportunities. Our study confirms that density is an
   important biological factor, which significantly influences the amount
   of EPP within and among subpopulations, but also suggests that other
   mechanisms influence EPP beyond the variation explained by density.}},

Title = {{Medicinal plant use in two Andean communities located at different

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: The study documents current medicinal
   plant knowledge and use in two Andean communities and depicts the
   dynamic nature of ethnobotanical relationships by illustrating cultural
   integration of biomedicine and local plant medicine into a complementary
   system.
   Aim of the study: In order to elucidate the importance of medicinal
   plants, the following research questions were addressed: Which position
   do medicinal plants have in the local health care system? Which plants
   are used medicinally, and do they differ between the communities? Is
   their use supported pharmacologically?
   Materials and methods: Fieldwork was done for seven months in 2010.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 120 informants in
   Uchumarca and Pusac/San Vicente de Paul, and the medicinal plant species
   mentioned by the informants were vouchered.
   Results: In total, 2776 plant remedy use reports were recorded. Most
   people in both communities know at least some medicinal plants, usually
   from their parents, grandparents, sometimes from books. There are
   different types of local plant specialists, who are consulted above all
   for the treatment of diseases thought to have a magical origin or for
   recommendations of plants to treat minor diseases. Overall, 140
   medicinal plants were documented, with a conformity of over 90\% between
   the communities. The effective use of the most frequently cited
   medicinal plants is supported by scientific literature. Most uses were
   reported for the treatment of gastrointestinal (17\%), nervous (14\%),
   respiratory (14\%), urological (13\%) and dermatological diseases (8\%);
   nervous diseases were more prevalent in the mountain community, while
   dermatological and urological diseases were more common in the valley.
   Conclusions: People combine medicinal plant use and biomedicine
   depending on the kind of disease, their beliefs, and their economic
   situation. The local use of different available medical resources is
   reflected by the combination of related epistemologies to explain
   disease causes. Medicinal plant use and biomedicine complement each
   other to form the local health care system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland

Title = {{A guide to analyzing biodiversity experiments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{91-110}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   The aim of this guide is to provide practical help for ecologists who
   analyze data from biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments. Our
   approach differs from others in the use of least squares-based linear
   models (LMs) together with restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed
   models (MMs) for the analysis of hierarchical data. An original data set
   containing diameter and height of young trees grown in monocultures, 2-
   or 4-species mixtures under ambient light or shade is used as an
   example.
   Methods
   Starting with a simple LM, basic features of model fitting and the
   subsequent analysis of variance (ANOVA) for significance tests are
   summarized. From this, more complex models are developed. We use the
   statistical software R for model fitting and to demonstrate similarities
   and complementarities between LMs and MMs. The formation of contrasts
   and the use of error (LMs) or random-effects (MMs) terms to account for
   hierarchical data structure in ANOVAs are explained.
   Important Findings
   Data from biodiversity experiments can be analyzed at the level of
   entire plant communities (plots) and plant individuals. The basic
   explanatory term is species composition, which can be divided into
   contrasts in many ways depending on specific biological hypotheses.
   Typically, these contrasts code for aspects of species richness or the
   presence of particular species. For significance tests in ANOVAs,
   contrast terms generally are compared with remaining variation of the
   explanatory terms from which they have been `carved out'. Once a final
   model has been selected, parameters (e.g. means or slopes for
   fixed-effects terms and variance components for error or random-effects
   terms) can be estimated to indicate the direction and size of effects.}},

Abstract = {{Community analyses of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) using ribosomal
   small subunit (SSU) or internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA sequences
   often suffer from low resolution or coverage. We developed a novel
   sequencing based approach for a highly resolving and specific profiling
   of AMF communities. We took advantage of previously established
   AMF-specific PCR primers that amplify a c. 1.5-kb long fragment covering
   parts of SSU, ITS and parts of the large ribosomal subunit (LSU), and we
   sequenced the resulting amplicons with single molecule real-time (SMRT)
   sequencing. The method was applicable to soil and root samples, detected
   all major AMF families and successfully discriminated closely related
   AMF species, which would not be discernible using SSU sequences. In
   inoculation tests we could trace the introduced AMF inoculum at the
   molecular level. One of the introduced strains almost replaced the local
   strain(s), revealing that AMF inoculation can have a profound impact on
   the native community. The methodology presented offers researchers a
   powerful new tool for AMF community analysis because it unifies improved
   specificity and enhanced resolution, whereas the drawback of medium
   sequencing throughput appears of lesser importance for low-diversity
   groups such as AMF.}},

Abstract = {{The `Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event' comprises the rapid
   diversification of marine organisms during the Ordovician Period. It is
   now clear that this adaptive radiation started for some organisms
   already in the Cambrian and continued for others beyond the end of the
   Ordovician, making the `Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event' part
   of a long-term late Proterozoic and Early Palaeozoic radiation, that in
   part is expressed by the fossil record as the `Cambrian Explosion.' A
   significant diversification of different groups of the plankton is
   observed in the late Cambrian-Early Ordovician interval, leading to the
   subsequent `Ordovician Plankton Revolution.' The possible causes of this
   `plankton revolution' are currently debated. They include changes in
   palaeoclimate, palaeogeography or tectonic and volcanic activity, as
   well as a modified nutrient supply. In this context, the Steptoean
   Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion delta C-13(carb) (SPICE) event in the
   late Cambrian (Paibian Stage, Furongian Series) has been related to a
   major increase in atmospheric O-2 (from 10-18\% to some 20 - 29\%) and
   to increased oceanic nutrient availability. Here we analyze the
   diversification of the planktonic groups during the late Cambrian and
   Early Ordovician, in particular in relation to the SPICE event. Our
   analyses include the changing diversities of the phytoplankton
   (acritarchs), diverse groups of zooplankton (e.g., radiolarians,
   graptolites, chitinozoans) and the switch to a planktonic mode of life
   of fossil groups (e.g., arthropods, molluscs) that were part of the
   Cambrian benthos and that later occupied pelagic niches. In addition, we
   focus also on data indicating evidence for a late Cambrian to Ordovician
   origin of planktotrophy in invertebrate larvae. It can be concluded that
   none of the diversifications of the different planktonic organisms can
   be related directly to the SPICE event. However, a long term (10-20
   million years) oxygenation pulse related to the SPICE event might have
   fuelled the explosion of phytoplankton diversity observed in the latest
   Cambrian-Early Ordovician that led to completely modified trophic
   structures permitting an increase in diversity and abundance of
   plankton-feeding groups during the Ordovician. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a graph representation that is based on the
   assumption that data live on a union of manifolds. Such a representation
   is based on sample proximities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and
   is thus linear in the feature space and nonlinear in the original space.
   Moreover, it also expresses sample relationships under sparse and
   low-rank constraints, meaning that the resulting graph will have limited
   connectivity (sparseness) and that samples belonging to the same group
   will be likely to be connected together and not with those from other
   groups (low rankness). We present this graph representation as a general
   representation that can be then applied to any graph-based method. In
   the experiments, we consider the clustering of hyperspectral images and
   semi-supervised classification (one class and multiclass).}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that several elements of the climate system could be
   tipped into a different state by global warming, causing irreversible
   economic damages. To address their policy implications, we incorporated
   five interacting climate tipping points into a stochastic-dynamic
   integrated assessment model, calibrating their likelihoods and
   interactions on results from an existing expert elicitation. Here we
   show that combining realistic assumptions about policymakers'
   preferences under uncertainty, with the prospect of multiple future
   interacting climate tipping points, increases the present social cost of
   carbon in the model nearly eightfold from US\$15 per tCO(2) to US\$116
   per tCO(2). Furthermore, passing some tipping points increases the
   likelihood of other tipping points occurring to such an extent that it
   abruptly increases the social cost of carbon. The corresponding optimal
   policy involves an immediate, massive effort to control CO2 emissions,
   which are stopped by mid-century, leading to climate stabilization at
   <1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.}},

Abstract = {{Surface digital elevation models (DEMs) and slope-related estimates of
   glacier thickness enable modelling of glacier-bed topographies over
   large ice-covered areas. Due to the erosive power of glaciers, such bed
   topographies can contain numerous overdeepenings, which when exposed
   following glacier retreat may fill with water and form new lakes. In
   this study, the bed overdeepenings for similar to 28 000 glaciers (40
   775 km(2)) of the Himalaya-Karakoram region are modelled using GlabTop2
   (Glacier Bed Topography model version 2), in which ice thickness is
   inferred from surface slope by parameterizing basal shear stress as a
   function of elevation range for each glacier. The modelled ice
   thicknesses are uncertain (+/- 30\%), but spatial patterns of ice
   thickness and bed elevation primarily depend on surface slopes as
   derived from the DEM and, hence, are more robust. About 16 000
   overdeepenings larger than 104 m(2) were detected in the modelled
   glacier beds, covering an area of similar to 2200 km(2) and having a
   volume of similar to 120 km(3) (3-4\% of present-day glacier volume).
   About 5000 of these overdeepenings (1800 km(2)) have a volume larger
   than 10(6) m(3). The results presented here are useful for anticipating
   landscape evolution and potential future lake formation with associated
   opportunities (tourism, hydropower) and risks (lake outbursts).}},

Abstract = {{This paper builds on the theoretical foundation outlined in Part I ('The
   real type and ideal type of transdisciplinary processes: part
   I-theoretical foundations') which is included in the same special
   feature. Mode 2 transdisciplinarity processes are characterized as
   processes that relate or integrate problem-oriented interdisciplinary
   research with knowledge generated in a multi-stakeholder approach with
   the objective to develop socially robust orientations, for instance, on
   sustainable transitioning. In practice, transdisciplinary processes may
   have different functions (i.e., societal capacity building, consensus
   building, analytic mediation, and legitimization). Practitioners and
   scientists may follow different interests. And we may distinguish
   between different types of knowledge integration (including different
   perspectives, modes of thoughts or cultures). Thus, the reality of
   transdisciplinarity processes may become a very complex and ambitious
   venture whose multiple objectives are difficult to realize in practice.
   This paper reviews the existing challenges, obstacles, and constraints
   of transdisciplinary processes. This review refers to 41 mid- and
   large-scale transdisciplinary studies run by members of the ITdNet at
   seven universities on sustainable transitions of urban and regional
   systems, organizations, and policy processes. A comprehensive table can
   be used as a checklist for identifying and coping with constraints and
   obstacles of transdisciplinary processes in practice. The discussion
   identifies the main challenges for the future development of
   transdisciplinarity's theory and practice, including linking Mode 1
   transdisciplinarity (i.e., the relating of disciplinary causation for
   which no interdisciplinarity is possible by merging concepts and
   methods) and Mode 2 transdisciplinarity, which targets sustainable
   knowledge and action for system transitioning.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The importance of between-group competition in the social evolution of
   animal societies is controversial, particularly with respect to
   understanding the origins and maintenance of cooperation in our own
   species. Among primates, aggressive between-group encounters are often
   rare or strikingly absent, a phenomenon that in some species has been
   ascribed to the presence of collective action problems. Here, we report
   on a series of comparative tests that show that the intensity of
   between-group contest competition is indeed lower in species that
   experience a collective action problem while controlling for predictions
   from an ``ideal gas{''} model of animal encounters and general species'
   ecology. Species that do not succumb to the collective action problem
   are either cooperative breeders, are characterized by philopatry of the
   dominant sex, or live in relatively small groups with few individuals of
   this dominant sex. This implies that collective action problems are
   averted either through shared genes and benefits or a by-product
   mutualism in which the territorial behavior of some privileged
   individuals is not affected by the behavior of others. We conclude that
   across the primate taxon, the intensity of between-group competition is
   predominantly constrained by a social dilemma among group members,
   rather than ecological conditions, and that the collective action
   problem is thus an important selective pressure in the evolution of
   primate (including human) cooperation and sociality.}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{66-77}},
Abstract = {{In spite of increasing recognition that intraspecific variation may play
   an important role for niche differentiation, which is regarded as a
   promoter of species coexistence, the extent and structure of functional
   trait variation in response to plant neighbor diversity is poorly
   understood. We studied the plasticity of functional traits in vegetative
   and reproductive shoots of 27 non-legume forb species with different
   growth forms (reptant, rosulate, semirosulate) in experimental
   grasslands (Jena Experiment) of varying species richness and functional
   group composition (with and without legumes). Traits related to
   whole-shoot structure differed strongly among forb species with
   different growth forms, while leaf traits associated with light
   acquisition (specific leaf area, foliar delta C-13 values) and traits
   associated with nitrogen nutrition (shoot biomass:N ratios, leaf
   nitrogen concentrations, foliar delta N-15 values) were highly plastic
   within forb species. Plant height generally increased with increasing
   species richness. Plasticities to increased species richness in leaf
   traits (leaf length, SLA, foliar delta C-13) varied among growth forms
   and depended on developmental stage. The presence of legumes generally
   increased plastic responses in light-acquisition traits in the same
   direction as increasing species richness. Greater tissue nitrogen
   concentrations and unchanged foliar delta N-15 values of forb species in
   the presence of legumes suggested that the fertilizing effect of
   nitrogen-fixing legumes was due to the supply of unconsumed mineral
   nitrogen. Stronger correlations between trait means and trait
   plasticities in size-related traits suggested a functional convergence
   in response to light competition. A more variable spectrum in the
   plasticities of traits not associated with plant size indicated a
   greater functional separation among species. Our results suggest that
   both interspecific differences and intraspecific trait plasticity affect
   niche partitioning among forb species and are important for their
   coexistence in multi-species assemblages. (C) 2014 Geobotanisches

Abstract = {{Glacier melt is an essential source of freshwater for the arid regions
   surrounding the Tian Shan. However, the knowledge about glacier volume
   and mass changes over the last decades is limited. In the present study,
   glacier area, glacier dynamics and mass changes are investigated for the
   period similar to 1975-2007 for Southern Inylchek Glacier (SIG) and
   Northern Inylchek Glacier (NIG), the largest glacier system in Central
   Tian Shan separated by the regularly draining Lake Merzbacher. The area
   of NIG increased by 2.0 +/- 0.1 km(2) (similar to 1.3 \%) in the period
   similar to 1975-2007. In contrast, SIG has shrunk continuously in all
   investigated periods since similar to 1975. Velocities of SIG in the
   central part of the ablation region reached similar to 100-120 m a(-1)
   in 2002/2003, which was slightly higher than the average velocity in
   2010/2011. The central part of SIG flows mainly towards Lake Merzbacher
   rather than towards its terminus. The measured velocities at the distal
   part of the terminus downstream of Lake Merzbacher were below the
   uncertainty, indicating very low flow with even stagnant parts. Geodetic
   glacier mass balances have been calculated using multi-temporal digital
   elevation models from KH9 Hexagon (representing the year 1975), SRTM3
   (1999), ALOS PRISM (2006) and SPOT-5 high-resolution geometrical (HRG)
   data (2007). In general, a continuous mass loss for both SIG and NIG
   could be observed between similar to 1975 and 2007. SIG lost mass at a
   rate of 0.43 +/- 0.10 m w.e.a(-1) and NIG at a rate of 0.25 +/- 0.10 m
   w.e.a(-1) within the period similar to 1975-1999. For the period
   1999-2007, the highest mass loss of 0.57 +/- 0.46 m w.e.a(-1) was found
   for NIG, whilst SIG showed a potential moderate mass loss of 0.28 +/-
   0.46 m w.e.a(-1). Both glaciers showed a small retreat during this
   period. Between similar to 1975 and 1999, we identified a thickening at
   the front of NIG with a maximum surface elevation increase of about 150m
   as a consequence of a surge event. In contrast significant thinning (>
   0.5 m a(-1)) and comparatively high velocities close to the dam of Lake
   Merzbacher were observed for SIG, indicating that Lake Merzbacher
   enhances glacier mass loss.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of inbreeding and inbreeding
   depression requires unbiased estimation of inbreeding depression across
   diverse mating systems. However, studies estimating inbreeding
   depression often measure inbreeding with error, for example, based on
   pedigree data derived from observed parental behavior that ignore
   paternity error stemming from multiple mating. Such paternity error
   causes error in estimated coefficients of inbreeding (f) and
   reproductive success and could bias estimates of inbreeding depression.
   We used complete ``apparent{''} pedigree data compiled from observed
   parental behavior and analogous ``actual{''} pedigree data comprising
   genetic parentage to quantify effects of paternity error stemming from
   extra-pair reproduction on estimates of f, reproductive success, and
   inbreeding depression in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia).
   Paternity error caused widespread error in estimates of f and male
   reproductive success, causing inbreeding depression in male and female
   annual and lifetime reproductive success and juvenile male survival to
   be substantially underestimated. Conversely, inbreeding depression in
   adult male survival tended to be overestimated when paternity error was
   ignored. Pedigree error stemming from extra-pair reproduction therefore
   caused substantial and divergent bias in estimates of inbreeding
   depression that could bias tests of evolutionary theories regarding
   inbreeding and inbreeding depression and their links to variation in
   mating system.}},

Abstract = {{The direct energy demand of Internet data flows can be assessed using a
   variety of methodological approaches (top-down, bottom-up, or
   hybrid/model based) and different definitions of system boundaries.
   Because of this diversity, results reported in the literature differ by
   up to two orders of magnitude and are difficult to compare. We present a
   first assessment that uses a pure bottom-up approach and a system
   boundary that includes only transmission equipment. The assessment is
   based on the case study of a 40megabit per second videoconferencing
   transmission between Switzerland and Japan, yielding a consumption of
   0.2kilowatt-hours per transmitted gigabyte for 2009, a result that
   supports the lowest of the existing estimates. We discuss the practical
   implications of our findings.}},

Abstract = {{Sequence data for >20000 annotated genes from 56 accessions of Medicago
   truncatula were used to identify potential targets of positive
   selection, the determinants of evolutionary rate variation and the
   relative importance of positive and purifying selection in shaping
   nucleotide diversity. Based upon patterns of intraspecific diversity and
   interspecific divergence, c. 50-75\% of nonsynonymous polymorphisms are
   subject to strong purifying selection and 1\% of the sampled genes
   harbour a signature of positive selection. Combining polymorphism with
   expression data, we estimated the distribution of fitness effects and
   found that the proportion of deleterious mutations is significantly
   greater for expressed genes than for genes with undetected transcripts
   (nonexpressed) in a previous RNA-seq experiment and greater for broadly
   expressed genes than those expressed in only a single tissue. Expression
   level is the strongest correlate of evolutionary rates at nonsynonymous
   sites, and despite multiple genomic features being significantly
   correlated with evolutionary rates, they explain less than 20\% of the
   variation in nonsynonymous rates (dN) and <15\% of the variation in
   either synonymous rates (dS) or dN:dS. Among putative targets of
   selection were genes involved in defence against pathogens and
   herbivores, genes with roles in mediating the relationship with
   rhizobial symbionts and one-third of annotated histone-lysine
   methyltransferases. Adaptive evolution of the methyltransferases
   suggests that positive selection in gene expression may have occurred
   through evolution of enzymes involved in epigenetic modification.}},

Title = {{Land use impacts on biodiversity in LCA: proposal of characterization
   factors based on functional diversity}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1231-1242}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The focus of land use modeling in life cycle impact assessment has been
   mainly on taxonomic measures of biodiversity, namely species richness
   (SR). However, increasing availability of trait data for species has led
   to the use of functional diversity (FD) as a promising metric to reflect
   the distinctiveness of species; this paper proposes the use of an FD
   index to calculate characterization factors (CFs) for land use impacts.
   Furthermore, we compare the results of the CFs to current practice and
   assess the increase in complexity introduced by the use of the new
   indicator.
   The model proposed is based on data compiled by previous regional
   meta-analysis on SR and FD, in different land use types in the Americas.
   The taxonomic groups included were mammals, birds, and plants. Within
   each study, calculated values for FD for different land use types were
   compared with the natural or close-to-natural state, taken as the
   reference situation. FD values among different land uses were
   standardized, and CFs were calculated. The final results were then
   analyzed and compared by analysis of variance and post hoc tests. A
   sensitivity analysis was also applied to verify the influence on the
   choice of the reference state.
   The results show that significant differences exist between CFs for SR
   and FD metrics. Across all taxa, CFs differ significantly between land
   use types. The results support the use of CF for FD, as a complement to
   current practice. Distinct CFs should be applied for at least six groups
   of land use categories. The choice of reference land use type did not
   significantly alter the results but can be a source of variability. A
   sensitivity analysis evaluating the impact of alternate land use types
   as reference types found only few significant changes on the results.
   Given the results, we believe the use of CFs based on FD can help on the
   establishment of possible links between species loss and key ecosystem
   functions, i.e., on the association between the midpoint indicator
   (e.g., biodiversity loss) and the damage caused to ecosystem quality, in
   terms of functions lost. Basing CFs on FD is not without challenges.
   Such indices are data hungry (requiring species composition and traits)
   require more complex calculations than current common practice,
   including decisions on the choice of a method to calculate FD and the
   selection of traits.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We sought to understand the variables that limit the distribution
   range of a clade (here the danthonioid grasses). We tested time, area of
   origin, habitat suitability, disjunction width and nature, and wind
   direction as possible range determinants. Location Global, but
   predominantly the Southern Hemisphere. Methods We mapped the range of
   the subfamily Danthonioideae, and used 39,000 locality records and an
   ensemble modelling approach to define areas with suitable danthonioid
   habitat. We used a well-sampled, dated phylogeny to estimate the number
   and direction of historical dispersal events, based on parsimony
   optimization. We tested for the impact of wind direction on dispersal
   rate using a likelihood approach, and for the effects of barrier width
   with a regression approach. Results We found 17 geographically isolated
   areas with suitable habitats for danthonioids. All currently suitable
   Southern Hemisphere areas have been occupied, but three apparently
   suitable areas in the Northern Hemisphere have not. We infer that
   southern Africa was first occupied in the Oligocene and that dispersal
   to the other areas was initiated in the middle Miocene. Inferred
   dispersal rate was correlated with the width of the disjunctions, up to
   a distance of 5000km. There was no support for wind direction having
   influenced differences in dispersal rate. Main conclusions The current
   range of the Danthonioideae can be predicted ecologically (areas with
   suitable habitat) and historically (the width of the disjunctions
   separating the areas with suitable habitat and the area of origin). The
   direction of dispersal is dictated by the area of origin and by
   serendipity: there is no evidence for general patterns of dispersal, for
   example for dispersal occurring more frequently over land than over sea
   or in an easterly versus a westerly direction around the Southern
   Hemisphere. Thus the range and range-filling of Danthonioideae can be
   accounted for by surprisingly few variables: habitat suitability,
   distance between suitable areas, and area of origin.}},

Abstract = {{Spontaneous sequence changes and the selection of beneficial mutations
   are driving forces of gene diversification and key factors of evolution.
   In highly dynamic co-evolutionary processes such as plant-pathogen
   interactions, the plant's ability to rapidly adapt to newly emerging
   pathogens is paramount. The hexaploid wheat gene Lr34, which encodes an
   ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, confers durable field resistance
   against four fungal diseases. Despite its extensive use in breeding and
   agriculture, no increase in virulence towards Lr34 has been described
   over the last century. The wheat genepool contains two predominant Lr34
   alleles of which only one confers disease resistance. The two alleles,
   located on chromosome 7DS, differ by only two exon-polymorphisms.
   Putatively functional homoeologs and orthologs of Lr34 are found on the
   B-genome of wheat and in rice and sorghum, but not in maize, barley and
   Brachypodium. In this study we present a detailed haplotype analysis of
   homoeologous and orthologous Lr34 genes in genetically and
   geographically diverse selections of wheat, rice and sorghum accessions.
   We found that the resistant Lr34 haplotype is unique to the wheat
   D-genome and is not found in the B-genome of wheat or in rice and
   sorghum. Furthermore, we only found the susceptible Lr34 allele in a set
   of 252 Ae. tauschii genotypes, the progenitor of the wheat D-genome.
   These data provide compelling evidence that the Lr34 multi-pathogen
   resistance is the result of recent gene diversification occurring after
   the formation of hexaploid wheat about 8,000 years ago.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands store substantial amounts of carbon in the form of organic
   matter in soil and roots. At high latitudes and elevation, turnover of
   these materials is slow due to various interacting biotic and abiotic
   constraints. Reliable estimates on the future of belowground carbon
   storage in cold grassland soils thus require quantitative understanding
   of these factors. We studied carbon turnover of roots, labile coarse
   particulate organic matter (cPOM) and older non-cPOM along a natural pH
   gradient (3.9-5.9) in a subalpine grassland by utilizing soil
   fractionation and radiocarbon dating. Soil carbon stocks and root
   biomass, turnover, and decomposability did not scale with soil pH
   whereas mean residence times of both soil organic matter fractions
   significantly increased with declining pH. The effect was twice as
   strong for non-cPOM, which was also stronger enriched in N-15 at low pH.
   Considering roots as important precursors for cPOM, the weaker soil pH
   effect on cPOM turnover may have been driven by comparably high root pH
   values. At pH < 5, long non-cPOM mean residence times were probably
   related to pH dependent changes in substrate availability. Differences
   in turnover along the pH gradient were not reflected in soil carbon
   stocks because aboveground productivity was lower under acidic
   conditions and, in turn, higher inputs from aboveground plant residues
   compensated for faster soil carbon turnover at less acidic pH. In
   summary, the study provides evidence for a strong and differential
   regulatory role of pH on the turnover of soil organic matter that needs
   consideration in studies aiming to quantify effects of changing
   environmental conditions on belowground carbon storage.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of competition between similar species in driving
   community assembly is much debated. Recently, phylogenetic patterns in
   species composition have been investigated to help resolve this
   question: phylogenetic clustering is taken to imply environmental
   filtering, and phylogenetic overdispersion to indicate limiting
   similarity between species. We used experimental plant communities with
   random species compositions and initially even abundance distributions
   to examine the development of phylogenetic pattern in species abundance
   distributions. Where composition was held constant by weeding, abundance
   distributions became overdispersed through time, but only in communities
   that contained distantly related clades, some with several species
   (i.e., a mix of closely and distantly related species). Phylogenetic
   pattern in composition therefore constrained the development of
   overdispersed abundance distributions, and this might indicate limiting
   similarity between close relatives and facilitation/complementarity
   between distant relatives. Comparing the phylogenetic patterns in these
   communities with those expected from the monoculture abundances of the
   constituent species revealed that interspecific competition caused the
   phylogenetic patterns. Opening experimental communities to colonization
   by all species in the species pool led to convergence in phylogenetic
   diversity. At convergence, communities were composed of several
   distantly related but species-rich clades and had overdispersed
   abundance distributions. This suggests that limiting similarity
   processes determine which species dominate a community but not which
   species occur in a community. Crucially, as our study was carried out in
   experimental communities, we could rule out local evolutionary or
   dispersal explanations for the patterns and identify ecological
   processes as the driving force, underlining the advantages of studying
   these processes in experimental communities. Our results show that
   phylogenetic relations between species provide a good guide to
   understanding community structure and add a new perspective to the
   evidence that niche complementarity is critical in driving community
   assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Glacier surface mass-balance measurements on Greenland started more than
   a century ago, but no compilation exists of the observations from the
   ablation area of the ice sheet and local glaciers. Such data could be
   used in the evaluation of modelled surface mass balance, or to document
   changes in glacier melt independently from model output. Here, we
   present a comprehensive database of Greenland glacier surface
   mass-balance observations from the ablation area of the ice sheet and
   local glaciers. The database spans the 123 a from 1892 to 2015, contains
   a total of similar to 3000 measurements from 46 sites, and is openly
   accessible through the PROMICE web portal (http://www.promice.dk). For
   each measurement we provide X, Y and Z coordinates, starting and ending
   dates as well as quality flags. We give sources for each entry and for
   all metadata. Two thirds of the data were collected from grey literature
   and unpublished archive documents. Roughly 60\% of the measurements were
   performed by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS,
   previously GGU). The data cover all regions of Greenland except for the
   southernmost part of the east coast, but also emphasize the importance
   of long-term time series of which there are only two exceeding 20 a. We
   use the data to analyse uncertainties in point measurements of surface
   mass balance, as well as to estimate surface mass-balance profiles for
   most regions of Greenland.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative breeding occurs in several major animal phyla, predominantly
   in arthropods and chordates. A number of comparative analyses have
   focused on understanding the evolution of cooperative breeding, yielding
   mixed, inconclusive, and often phyla-specific findings. We argue that
   much of this ambiguity results from an erroneous classification of
   social systems into noncooperatively and cooperatively breeding species.
   The shortcomings of this assumption are apparent among birds where
   noncooperative species constitute a heterogeneous group: some species
   are clearly non-family living, with offspring dispersing at or shortly
   after nutritional independency, whereas other species form persistent
   family groups through offspring delaying their dispersal substantially
   beyond independency. Here, we propose an objective, life history-based
   criterion classifying noncooperative bird species into non-family living
   and family living species. We demonstrate that by using the family time
   (the time offspring remain with its parent/s beyond independence) and
   body size-scaled reproductive investment, we are able to differentiate 2
   groups with contrasting life histories. Our classification matches
   seasonal environmental variation experienced by different species:
   family living species postpone dispersal beyond the onset of less
   favorable autumn conditions. We discuss the consequences of this new
   social system classification for evolutionary and ecological research,
   potentially allowing solutions to some of the most intriguing riddles in
   the evolutionary history of birds-and cooperative behavior itself.}},

Volume = {{184}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{593-608}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{How the relative importance of community assembly processes varies with
   spatial scale is the focus of intensive debate, in part because
   inferring the scales at which specific niche-based processes act is
   difficult. One obstacle is that standard phylogenetic and functional
   diversity metrics may integrate the signals of multiple processes when
   combining separate niche axes into one variable (multiple-niche-axis
   metrics), potentially obscuring overlapping niche-based processes. We
   use simulations to evaluate the power of these metrics to detect
   competition and habitat filtering when these processes operate across
   multiple niche axes and vary in their relative importance. We then test
   for both processes at a range of spatial scales in a Neotropical bird
   assemblage. Simulations revealed that multiple-niche-axis metrics had
   low power to detect competition and habitat filtering when a mix of both
   processes acts across niche axes, whereas metrics focused on
   single-niche axes were better able to deal with this complexity. We
   found the same contrast in bird communities, where both competition and
   habitat filtering were detected at the scale of individual territories,
   but only by single-niche-axis metrics focused on specific niche axes (e.
   g., foraging traits). Our results suggest that multiple-niche-axis
   metrics may produce misleading evidence that niche-based processes are
   partitioned, particularly across scales, and highlight the importance of
   analyzing functional diversity patterns on individual niche axes when
   testing assembly models.}},

Abstract = {{Phytyl diphosphate (PDP) is the prenyl precursor for tocopherol
   biosynthesis. Based on recent genetic evidence, PDP is supplied to the
   tocopherol biosynthetic pathway primarily by chlorophyll degradation and
   sequential phytol phosphorylation. Three enzymes of Arabidopsis
   (Arabidopsis thaliana) are known to be capable of removing the phytol
   chain from chlorophyll in vitro: chlorophyllase1 (CLH1), CLH2, and
   pheophytin pheophorbide hydrolase (PPH), which specifically hydrolyzes
   pheophytin. While PPH, but not chlorophyllases, is required for in vivo
   chlorophyll breakdown during Arabidopsis leaf senescence, little is
   known about the involvement of these phytol-releasing enzymes in
   tocopherol biosynthesis. To explore the origin of PDP for tocopherol
   synthesis, seed tocopherol concentrations were determined in Arabidopsis
   lines engineered for seed-specific overexpression of PPH and in single
   and multiple mutants in the three genes encoding known dephytylating
   enzymes. Except for modestly increasing tocopherol content observed in
   the PPH overexpressor, none of the remaining lines exhibited
   significantly reduced tocopherol concentrations, suggesting that the
   known chlorophyll-derived phytol-releasing enzymes do not play major
   roles in tocopherol biosynthesis. Tocopherol content of seeds from
   double mutants in NONYELLOWING1 (NYE1) and NYE2, regulators of
   chlorophyll degradation, had modest reduction compared with wild-type
   seeds, although mature seeds of the double mutant retained significantly
   higher chlorophyll levels. These findings suggest that NYEs may play
   limited roles in regulating an unknown tocopherol biosynthesis-related
   phytol hydrolase. Meanwhile, seeds of wild-type over-expressing NYE1 had
   lower tocopherol levels, suggesting that phytol derived from
   NYE1-dependent chlorophyll degradation probably doesn't enter tocopherol
   biosynthesis. Potential routes of chlorophyll degradation are discussed
   in relation to tocopherol biosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Disease is a ubiquitous and powerful evolutionary force. Hosts have
   evolved behavioural and physiological responses to disease that are
   associated with increased survival. Behavioural modifications, known as
   `sickness behaviours', frequently involve symptoms such as lethargy,
   somnolence and anorexia. Current research has demonstrated that the
   social environment is a potent modulator of these behaviours: when
   conflicting social opportunities arise, animals can decrease or entirely
   forgo experiencing sickness symptoms. Here, I review how different
   social contexts, such as the presence of mates, caring for offspring,
   competing for territories or maintaining social status, affect the
   expression of sickness behaviours. Exploiting the circumstances that
   promote this behavioural plasticity will provide new insights into the
   evolutionary ecology of social behaviours. A deeper understanding of
   when and how this modulation takes place may lead to better tools to
   treat symptoms of infection and be relevant for the development of more
   efficient disease control programmes.}},

Abstract = {{The Uummannaq Ice Stream System (UISS) was a convergent cross-shelf ice
   stream system that operated in West Greenland during the Last Glacial
   Maximum (LGM). This paper presents new evidence constraining the
   geometry and evolution of the northern sector of the UISS and considers
   the factors controlling its dynamic behaviour. Geomorphological mapping,
   21 new terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) exposure ages, and
   radiocarbon dating constrain LGM warm-based ice stream activity in the
   north of the system up to 1400 m a.s.l. Intervening plateaux areas
   either remained ice free, or were covered by cold-based icefields.
   Beyond the inner fjords, topography and bathymetry forced ice flow
   southwards into the Uummannaq Trough, where it coalesced with ice from
   the south, and formed the trunk zone of the UISS.
   Deglaciation of the UISS began at 14.9 cal. ka BP. Rapid retreat from
   the LGM limit was forced by an increase in air temperatures and rising
   sea level, enhanced by the bathymetric over-deepening of the Uummannaq
   and Igdlorssuit Sund troughs. Ice reached the inner fjord confines in
   the northern Uummannaq area by 11.6 ka and experienced an ice marginal
   stabilisation in Rink-Karrat Fjord for up to 5 ka. This was a function
   of topographic constriction and bathymetric shallowing, and occurred
   despite continued climatic forcing. In the neighbouring Ingia Fjord this
   did not occur. Following this period of stability, ice within
   Rink-Karrat Fjord retreated, reaching the present ice margin or beyond
   after 5 ka. The presence of a major ice stream within a mid-fjord
   setting, during the mid-Holocene and the Holocene Thermal Maximum (
   similar to 11-5 ka) is in direct contrast to records of other ice
   streams throughout West Greenland, which suggest ice had retreated
   beyond its present margin by 9-7 ka. This demonstrates the potential
   importance of topographic control on calving margin stability, and its
   ability to override climatic forcing. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fire has been proposed as a factor explaining the exceptional plant
   species richness found in Mediterranean regions. A fire response trait
   that allows plants to cope with frequent fire by either reseeding or
   resprouting could differentially affect rates of species
   diversification. However, little is known about the generality of the
   effects of differing fire response on species evolution. We study this
   question in the Restionaceae, a family that radiated in Southern Africa
   and Australia. These radiations occurred independently and represent
   evolutionary replicates. We apply Bayesian approaches to estimate
   trait-specific diversification rates and patterns of climatic niche
   evolution. We also compare the climatic heterogeneity of South Africa
   and Australia. Reseeders diversify faster than resprouters in South
   Africa, but not in Australia. We show that climatic preferences evolve
   more rapidly in reseeder lineages than in resprouters and that the
   optima of these climatic preferences differ between the two strategies.
   We find that South Africa is more climatically heterogeneous than
   Australia, independent of the spatial scale we consider. We propose that
   rapid shifts between states of the fire response trait promote
   speciation by separating species ecologically, but this only happens
   when the landscape is sufficiently heterogeneous.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial ice loss has occurred in the Russian High Arctic during the
   past decade, predominantly on Novaya Zemlya, yet the region has been
   studied relatively little. Consequently, the factors forcing mass loss
   and the relative contribution of ice dynamics versus surface melt are
   poorly understood. Here we evaluate the influence of atmospheric/oceanic
   forcing and variations in fjord width on the behaviour of 38 glaciers on
   the northern ice cap, Novaya Zemlya. We compare retreat rates on land-
   versus marine-terminating outlets and on the Kara versus Barents Sea
   coasts. Between 1992 and 2010, 90\% of the study glaciers retreated and
   retreat rates were an order of magnitude higher for marine-terminating
   outlets (52.1 m a(-1)) than for land-terminating glaciers (4.8 m a(-1)).
   We identify a post-2000 acceleration in marine-terminating glacier
   retreat, which corresponded closely to changes in sea-ice
   concentrations. Retreat rates were higher on the Barents Sea coast,
   which we partly attribute to lower sea-ice concentrations, but varied
   dramatically between individual glaciers. We use empirical data to
   categorize changes in along-flow fjord width, and demonstrate a
   significant relationship between fjord width variability and retreat
   rate. Results suggest that variations in fjord width exert a major
   influence on glacier retreat.}},

Title = {{Afforestation with Norway spruce on a subalpine pasture alters carbon
   dynamics but only moderately affects soil carbon storage}},

Abstract = {{There is a strong trend toward reforestation of abandoned grasslands in
   alpine regions which may impact the carbon balance of alpine ecosystems.
   Here, we studied the effects of afforestation with Norway spruce (Picea
   abies L.) on an extensively grazed subalpine pasture in Switzerland on
   soil organic carbon (SOC) cycling and storage. Along a 120-year long
   chronosequence with spruce stands of 25, 30, 40, 45, and > 120 years and
   adjacent pastures, we measured tree biomass, SOC stocks down to the
   bedrock, natural C-13 abundances, and litter quality. To unravel
   controls on SOC cycling, we have monitored microclimatic conditions and
   quantified SOC decomposability under standardized conditions as well as
   soil respiration in situ. Stocks of SOC were only moderately affected by
   the afforestation: in the mineral soil, SOC stocks transiently decreased
   after tree establishment, reaching a minimum 40-45 years after
   afforestation (-25 \%) and increased thereafter. Soils of the mature
   spruce forest stored the largest amount of SOC, 13 \% more than the
   pasture soils, mainly due to the accumulation of an organic layer (23 t
   C ha(-1)). By comparison, C accumulated in the tree biomass exceeded the
   SOC pool by a factor of three in the old forest. In contrast to the
   small impact on C storage, afforestation strongly influenced the
   composition and quality of the soil organic matter (SOM). With
   increasing stand age, delta C-13 values of the SOM became consistently
   more positive, which can be interpreted as a gradual replacement of
   grass- by spruce-derived C. Fine roots of spruce were enriched in C-13,
   in lignin and had a higher C/N ratio in comparison to grass roots. As a
   consequence, SOM quality as indicated by the lower fraction of readily
   decomposable (labile) SOM and higher C:N ratios declined after the
   land-use change. Furthermore, spruce plantation induced a less favorable
   microclimate for microbial activity with the average soil temperature
   during the growing season being 5 A degrees C lower in the spruce stands
   than in the pasture. In situ soil respiration was approximately 50 \%
   lower after the land use conversion, which we primarily attribute to the
   colder conditions and the lower SOM quality, but also to drier soils
   (-25 \%) and to a decreased fine root biomass (-40 \%). In summary,
   afforestation on subalpine pastures only moderately affected SOC storage
   as compared to the large C sink in tree biomass. In contrast, SOC
   cycling rates strongly decreased as a result of a less favorable
   microclimate for decomposition of SOM, a lower C input by roots, and a
   lower litter quality.}},

Abstract = {{Flocking is a paradigmatic example of collective animal behaviour, where
   global order emerges out of self-organization. Each individual has a
   tendency to align its flight direction with those of neighbours, and
   such a simple form of interaction produces a state of collective motion
   of the group. When compared with other cases of collective ordering, a
   crucial feature of animal groups is that the interaction network is not
   fixed in time, as each individual moves and continuously changes its
   neighbours. The possibility to exchange neighbours strongly enhances the
   stability of global ordering and the way information is propagated
   through the group. Here, we assess the relevance of this mechanism in
   large flocks of starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). We find that birds move
   faster than Brownian walkers both with respect to the centre of mass of
   the flock, and with respect to each other. Moreover, this behaviour is
   strongly anisotropic with respect to the direction of motion of the
   flock. We also measure the amount of neighbours reshuffling and find
   that neighbours change in time exclusively as a consequence of the
   random fluctuations in the individual motion, so that no specific
   mechanism to keep one's neighbours seems to be enforced. On the
   contrary, our findings suggest that a more complex dynamical process
   occurs at the border of the flock.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas occupy diverse environments. The
   Pseudomonas fluorescens group is particularly well-known for its
   plant-beneficial properties including pathogen suppression. Recent
   observations that some strains of this group also cause lethal
   infections in insect larvae, however, point to a more versatile ecology
   of these bacteria. We show that 26 P. fluorescens group strains,
   isolated from three continents and covering three phylogenetically
   distinct sub-clades, exhibited different activities toward lepidopteran
   larvae, ranging from lethal to avirulent. All strains of sub-clade 1,
   which includes Pseudomonas chlororaphis and Pseudomonas protegens, were
   highly insecticidal regardless of their origin (animals, plants).
   Comparative genomics revealed that strains in this sub-clade possess
   specific traits allowing a switch between plant-and insect-associated
   lifestyles. We identified 90 genes unique to all highly insecticidal
   strains (sub-clade 1) and 117 genes common to all strains of sub-clade 1
   and present in some moderately insecticidal strains of sub-clade 3.
   Mutational analysis of selected genes revealed the importance of
   chitinase C and phospholipase C in insect pathogenicity. The study
   provides insight into the genetic basis and phylogenetic distribution of
   traits defining insecticidal activity in plant-beneficial pseudomonads.
   Strains with potent dual activity against plant pathogens and
   herbivorous insects have great potential for use in integrated pest
   management for crops.}},

Abstract = {{Carbonaceous materials like biochars are increasingly recognized as
   effective sorbent materials for sequestering organic pollutants. Here,
   we study sorption behavior of two common hydrophobic organic
   contaminants 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (CB52) and phenanthrene
   (PHE), on biochars and other carbonaceous materials (CM) produced at a
   wide range of conditions and temperatures from various feedstocks. The
   primary aim was to establish structure-reactivity relationships
   responsible for the observed variation in CM and biochar sorption
   characteristics. CM were characterized for their elemental composition,
   surface area, pore size distribution, aromaticity and thermal stability.
   Freundlich sorption coefficients for CB52 and PHE (i.e. LogK(F,CB52) and
   K-F,K-PHE, respectively) to CM showed a variation of two to three orders
   of magnitude, with LogK(F,CB52) ranging from 5.12 +/- 0.38 to 8.01 +/-
   0.18 and LogK(F,PHE) from 5.18 +/- 0.09 to 7.42 +/- 1.09. The highest
   LogK(F) values were observed for the activated CM, however,
   non-activated biochars produced at high temperatures (>700 degrees C)
   sorbed almost as strongly (within 0.2-0.5 Log units) as the activated
   ones. Sorption coefficients significantly increased with pyrolysis
   temperature, CM surface area and pore volume, aromaticity, and thermal
   stability, and decreased with H/C, O/C, (O + N)/C content. The results
   of our study contribute to the understanding of processes underlying HOC
   sorption to CM and explore the potential of CM as engineered sorbents
   for environmental applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Chemical cues that evoke anti-predator developmental changes have
   received considerable attention, but it is not known to what extent prey
   use information from the smell of predators and from cues released
   through digestion. We conducted an experiment to determine the
   importance of various types of cues for the adjustment of anti-predator
   defences. We exposed tadpoles (common frog, Rana temporaria) to water
   originating from predators (caged dragonfly larvae, Aeshna cyanea) that
   were fed different types and quantities of prey outside of
   tadpole-rearing containers. Variation among treatments in the magnitude
   of morphological and behavioural responses was highly consistent. Our
   results demonstrate that tadpoles can assess the threat posed by
   predators through digestion-released, prey-borne cues and continually
   released predator-borne cues. These cues may play an important role in
   the fine-tuning of anti-predator responses and significantly affect the
   outcome of interactions between predators and prey in aquatic
   ecosystems. There has been much confusion regards terminology used in
   the literature, and therefore we also propose a more precise and
   consistent binomial nomenclature based on the timing of chemical cue
   release (stress-, attack-, capture-, digestion- or continually released
   cues) and the origin of cues (prey-borne or predator-borne cues). We
   hope that this new nomenclature will improve comparisons among studies
   on this topic.}},

   acquired regularly and tested for geolocation accuracy and consistency
   during dedicated corner reflector (CR) campaigns. At the completion of
   this phase, small geometric inconsistencies had been understood and
   mitigated, with the high quality of the final product geolocation
   estimates reflecting the mission's success thus far. This paper

Title = {{A framework for the science contribution in climate adaptation:
   Experiences from science-policy processes in the Andes}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{As significant impacts of climate change are increasingly considered
   unavoidable, adaptation has become a policy priority. It is generally
   agreed that science is important for the adaptation process but specific
   guidance on how and to what degree science should contribute and be
   embedded in this process is still limited which is at odds with the high
   demand for science contributions to climate adaptation by international
   organizations, national governments and others. Here we present and
   analyze experiences from the tropical Andes based on a recent
   science-policy process on the national and supra-national government
   level. During this process a framework for the science contribution in
   climate adaptation has been developed; it consists of three stages,
   including (1) the framing and problem definition, (2) the scientific
   assessment of climate, impacts, vulnerabilitis and risks, and (3) the
   evaluation of adaptation options and their implementation. A large
   amount of methods has been analyzed for stage (2), and a number of major
   climate adaptation projects in the region assessed for (3). Our study
   underlines the importance of joint problem framing among various
   scientific and non-scientific actors, definition of socio-environmental
   systems, time frames, and a more intense interaction of social and
   physical climate and impact sciences. Scientifically, the scarcity of
   environmental, social and economic data in regions like the Andes
   continue to represent a limitation to adaptation, and further
   investments into coordinated socio-environmental monitoring, data
   availability and sharing are essential. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

   Germination}},
Journal = {{PLANT PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{167}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Germination of pollen grains is a crucial step in plant reproduction.
   However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. We
   investigated the role of PECTIN METHYLESTERASE48 (PME48), an enzyme
   implicated in the remodeling of pectins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
   thaliana) pollen. A combination of functional genomics, gene expression,
   in vivo and in vitro pollen germination, immunolabeling, and biochemical
   analyses was used on wild-type and Atpme48 mutant plants. We showed that
   AtPME48 is specifically expressed in the male gametophyte and is the
   second most expressed PME in dry and imbibed pollen grains. Pollen
   grains from homozygous mutant lines displayed a significant delay in
   imbibition and germination in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, numerous
   pollen grains showed two tips emerging instead of one in the wild type.
   Immunolabeling and Fourier transform infrared analyses showed that the
   degree of methylesterification of the homogalacturonan was higher in
   pme48-/- pollen grains. In contrast, the PME activity was lower in
   pme48-/-, partly due to a reduction of PME48 activity revealed by
   zymogram. Interestingly, the wild-type phenotype was restored in
   pme48-/- with the optimum germination medium supplemented with 2.5 mM
   calcium chloride, suggesting that in the wild-type pollen, the weakly
   methylesterified homogalacturonan is a source of Ca2+ necessary for
   pollen germination. Although pollen-specific PMEs are traditionally
   associated with pollen tube elongation, this study provides strong
   evidence that PME48 impacts the mechanical properties of the intine wall
   during maturation of the pollen grain, which, in turn, influences pollen
   grain germination.}},

Abstract = {{Changing agricultural practices have dramatically altered the arable
   flora of Europe since the Second World War. We conducted a meta-analysis
   of the available literature to assess the dynamics of species richness
   and species traits in the arable flora across Europe during this time
   period. We found a total of 32 publications, yielding 53 data sets with
   an average number of 252 studied plots per data set. Average species
   number per plot of arable plants across all data sets declined by about
   20\%. However, twelve data sets showed an increase in average species
   number per plot, including all studies starting after 1980. Plant
   species preferring nutrient-rich sites, neophytes and monocotyledons
   generally increased since 1980, while characteristic or threatened
   species of arable weed communities further declined. This temporal
   development of the European arable flora suggests that the changes
   happening in agricultural management since the 1980s, such as organic
   farming and reduced pesticide input, may have helped slow the decline of
   the arable flora in terms of species number, but not in terms of
   characteristic or threatened arable weeds. Hence, more specific measures
   are necessary to stop decline of the latter, making sure that these
   measures are advantageous for rare and characteristic arable species,
   but not for harmful weeds.}},

Title = {{Thermal characteristics of permafrost in the steep alpine rock walls of
   the Aiguille du Midi (Mont Blanc Massif, 3842 m a.s.l)}},

Abstract = {{Permafrost and related thermo-hydro-mechanical processes are thought to
   influence high alpine rock wall stability, but a lack of field
   measurements means that the characteristics and processes of rock wall
   permafrost are poorly understood. To help remedy this situation, in 2005
   work began to install a monitoring system at the Aiguille du Midi (3842
   m a.s.l). This paper presents temperature records from nine surface
   sensors (eight years of records) and three 10 m deep boreholes (4 years
   of records), installed at locations with different surface and bedrock
   characteristics. In line with previous studies, our temperature data
   analyses showed that: micro-meteorology controls the surface
   temperature, active layer thicknesses are directly related to aspect and
   ranged from < 2m to nearly 6 m, and that thin accumulations of snow and
   open fractures are cooling factors. Thermal profiles empirically
   demonstrated the coexistence within a single rock peak of warm and cold
   permafrost (about -1.5 to -4.5 degrees C at 10 m depth) and the
   resulting lateral heat fluxes. Our results also extended current
   knowledge of the effect of snow, in that we found similar
   thermo-insulation effects as reported for gentle mountain areas. Thick
   snow warms shaded areas, and may reduce active layer refreezing in
   winter and delay its thawing in summer. However, thick snow
   thermo-insulation has little effect compared to the high albedo of snow
   which leads to cooler conditions at the rock surface in areas exposed to
   the sun. A consistent inflection in the thermal profiles reflected the
   cooling effect of an open fracture in the bedrock, which appeared to act
   as a thermal cutoff in the sub-surface thermal regime. Our field data
   are the first to be obtained from an Alpine permafrost site where
   borehole temperatures are below -4 degrees C, and represent a first step
   towards the development of strategies to investigate poorly known
   aspects in steep bedrock permafrost such as the effects of snow cover
   and fractures.}},

Abstract = {{High pollinator specificity and the potential for simple genetic changes
   to affect pollinator attraction make sexually deceptive orchids an ideal
   system for the study of ecological speciation, in which change of flower
   odour is likely important. This study surveys reproductive barriers and
   differences in floral phenotypes in a group of four closely related,
   coflowering sympatric Ophrys species and uses a genotyping-by-sequencing
   (GBS) approach to obtain information on the proportion of the genome
   that is differentiated between species. Ophrys species were found to
   effectively lack postpollination barriers, but are strongly isolated by
   their different pollinators (floral isolation) and, to a smaller extent,
   by shifts in flowering time (temporal isolation). Although flower
   morphology and perhaps labellum coloration may contribute to floral
   isolation, reproductive barriers may largely be due to differences in
   flower odour chemistry. GBS revealed shared polymorphism throughout the
   Ophrys genome, with very little population structure between species.
   Genome scans for F-ST outliers identified few markers that are highly
   differentiated between species and repeatable in several populations.
   These genome scans also revealed highly differentiated polymorphisms in
   genes with putative involvement in floral odour production, including a
   previously identified candidate gene thought to be involved in the
   biosynthesis of pseudo-pheromones by the orchid flowers. Taken together,
   these data suggest that ecological speciation associated with different
   pollinators in sexually deceptive orchids has a genic rather than a
   genomic basis, placing these species at an early phase of genomic
   divergence within the speciation continuum'.}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Tool use in extant primates may inform our understanding of the
   conditions that favoured the expansion of hominin technology and
   material culture. The `method of exclusion' has, arguably, confirmed the
   presence of culture in wild animal populations by excluding ecological
   and genetic explanations for geographical variation in behaviour.
   However, this method neglects ecological influences on culture, which,
   ironically, may be critical for understanding technology and thus
   material culture. We review all the current evidence for the role of
   ecology in shaping material culture in three habitual tool-using
   non-human primates: chimpanzees, orangutans and capuchin monkeys. We
   show that environmental opportunity, rather than necessity, is the main
   driver. We argue that a better understanding of primate technology
   requires explicit investigation of the role of ecological conditions. We
   propose a model in which three sets of factors, namely environment,
   sociality and cognition, influence invention, transmission and retention
   of material culture.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of interacting species and elucidation of their mode
   of interaction may be crucial to understand ecosystem-level processes.
   We analysed the activity and identity of bacterial epibionts in cultures
   of Daphnia galeata and of natural daphnid populations. Epibiotic
   bacteria incorporated considerable amounts of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), as estimated via uptake of tritiated leucine: three times more
   tracer was consumed by microbes on a single Daphnia than in 1ml of lake
   water. However, there was virtually no incorporation if daphnids were
   anaesthetised, suggesting that their filtration activity was essential
   for this process. Microbial DOC uptake could predominantly be assigned
   to microbes that were located on the filter combs of daphnids, where the
   passage of water would ensure a continuously high DOC supply. Most of
   these bacteria were Betaproteobacteria from the genus Limnohabitans.
   Specifically, we identified a monophyletic cluster harbouring
   Limnohabitans planktonicus that encompassed sequence types from D.
   galeata cultures, from the gut of Daphnia magna and from daphnids of
   Lake Zurich. Our results suggest that the epibiotic growth of bacteria
   related to Limnohabitans on Daphnia spp. may be a widespread and rather
   common phenomenon. Moreover, most of the observed DOC flux to Daphnia in
   fact does not seem to be associated with the crustacean biomass itself
   but with its epibiotic microflora. The unexplored physical association
   of daphnids with heterotrophic bacteria may have considerable
   implications for our understanding of carbon transfer in freshwater food
   webs, that is, a trophic `shortcut' between microbial DOC uptake and
   predation by fish.}},

Abstract = {{Socially learned behaviours leading to genetic population structure have
   rarely been described outside humans. Here, we provide evidence of
   fine-scale genetic structure that has probably arisen based on socially
   transmitted behaviours in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in western
   Shark Bay, Western Australia. We argue that vertical social transmission
   in different habitats has led to significant geographical genetic
   structure of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes. Dolphinswith mtDNA
   haplotypes E or F are found predominantly in deep (more than 10 m)
   channel habitat, while dolphins with a third haplotype (H) are found
   predominantly in shallow habitat (less than 10 m), indicating a strong
   haplotype-habitat correlation. Some dolphins in the deep habitat engage
   in a foraging strategy using tools. These ` sponging' dolphins are
   members of one matriline, carrying haplotype E. This pattern is
   consistent with what had been demonstrated previously at another
   research site in Shark Bay, where vertical social transmission of
   sponging had been shown using multiple lines of evidence. Using an
   individual-based model, we found support that in western Shark Bay,
   socially transmitted specializations may have led to the observed
   genetic structure. The reported genetic structure appears to present an
   example of cultural hitchhiking of mtDNA haplotypes on socially
   transmitted foraging strategies, suggesting that, as in humans, genetic
   structure can be shaped through cultural transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Distinct layers of iron(III) and manganese(IV) (Fe/Mn) oxides are found
   buried within the reducing part of the sediments in Lake Baikal and
   cause considerable complexity and steep vertical gradients with respect
   to the redox sequence. For the on-site investigation of the responsible
   biogeochemical processes, we applied filter tube samplers for the
   extraction of sediment porewater combined with a portable capillary
   electrophoresis instrument for the analyses of inorganic cations and
   anions. On the basis of the new results, the sequence of diagenetic
   processes leading to the formation, transformation, and dissolution of
   the Fe/Mn layers was investigated. With two exemplary cores we
   demonstrate that the dissolution of particulate Fe and Mn is coupled to
   the anaerobic oxidation of CH4 (AOM) either via the reduction of
   sulphate (SO42-) and the subsequent generation of Fe(II) by S(-II)
   oxidation, or directly coupled to Fe reduction. Dissolved Fe(II)
   diffuses upwards to reduce particulate Mn(IV) thus forming a sharp
   mineral boundary. An alternative dissolution pathway is indicated by the
   occurrence of anaerobic nitrification of NH4+ observed at locations with
   Mn(IV). Furthermore, the reasons and consequences of the
   non-steady-state sediment pattern and the resulting redox
   discontinuities are discussed and a suggestion for the burial of active
   Fe/Mn layers is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Although the potential to adapt to warmer climate is constrained by
   genetic trade-offs, our understanding of how selection and mutation
   shape genetic (co)variances in thermal reaction norms is poor. Using 71
   isofemale lines of the fly Sepsis punctum, originating from northern,
   central, and southern European climates, we tested for divergence in
   juvenile development rate across latitude at five experimental
   temperatures. To investigate effects of evolutionary history in
   different climates on standing genetic variation in reaction norms, we
   further compared genetic (co) variances between regions. Flies were
   reared on either high or low food resources to explore the role of
   energy acquisition in determining genetic trade-offs between different
   temperatures. Although the latter had only weak effects on the strength
   and sign of genetic correlations, genetic architecture differed
   significantly between climatic regions, implying that evolution of
   reaction norms proceeds via different trajectories at high latitude
   versus low latitude in this system. Accordingly, regional genetic
   architecture was correlated to region-specific differentiation.
   Moreover, hot development temperatures were associated with low genetic
   variance and stronger genetic correlations compared to cooler
   temperatures. We discuss the evolutionary potential of thermal reaction
   norms in light of their underlying genetic architectures, evolutionary
   histories, and the materialization of trade-offs in natural
   environments.}},

Title = {{Representing major soil variability at regional scale by constrained

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a sparse, remote sensing-based sampling approach
   making use of conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) to assess
   variability in soil properties at regional scale. The method optimizes
   the sampling scheme for a defined spatial population based on selected
   covariates, which are assumed to represent the variability of the target
   variables. The optimization also accounts for specific constraints and
   costs expressing the field sampling effort. The approach is demonstrated
   using a case study in Morocco, where a small but representative sample
   record had to be collected over a 15,000 km(2) area within 2 weeks. The
   covariate space of the Latin Hypercube consisted of the first three
   principal components of ASTER imagery as well as elevation. Comparison
   of soil properties taken from the topsoil with the existing soil map, a
   geological map and lithological data showed that the sampling approach
   was successful in representing major soil variability. The cLHS sample
   failed to express spatial correlation; constraining the LHS by a
   distance criterion favoured large spatial variability within a short
   distances resulting in an overestimation of the variograms nugget and
   short distance variability. However, the exhaustive covariate data
   appeared to be spatially correlated which supports our premise that once
   the relation between spatially explicit remote sensing data and soil
   properties has been modelled, the latter can be spatially predicted
   based on the densely sampled remotely sensed data. Therefore, the LHS
   approach is considered as time and cost efficient for regional scale
   surveys that rely on remote sensing-based prediction of soil properties.

Abstract = {{Stem rust of wheat, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, was
   under control worldwide for over 30 years by utilizing genetic
   resistance. The emergence of stem rust in 1998 in eastern Africa in form
   of race Ug99 and its evolving variants with virulence to many resistance
   genes were recognized as potential threats to wheat production. In this
   study we identified genomic regions contributing to putatively durable,
   adult plant resistance (APR) to wheat stem rust. A recombinant inbred
   line (RIL) population of 298 lines was previously developed at CIMMYT
   from a cross between `Avocet S' and `Pavon 76'. Pavon 76 has been
   described to carry APR to stem rust. Avocet S carries the race-specific
   resistance gene Sr26. A subset of RILs without Sr26 segregated for APR
   to stem rust race Ug99 when evaluated in Kenya for three years. Single
   year and joint year analysis by inclusive composite interval mapping
   using 450 DArT markers identified five quantitative trait loci (QTL)
   that contributed to the resistance of wheat to stem rust race Ug99.
   Three of these, including QSr.cim-3B, which probably represents the Sr2
   gene, were contributed by Pavon 76 whereas the remaining two QTL were
   contributed by Avocet S. QSr.cim-3B, or putatively Sr2, on chromosome
   arm 3BS explained 32 \% of the phenotypic variation while the additional
   QTL in Pavon contributed 24 and 20 \%, respectively. Two QTL from Avocet
   S explained 8 and 6 \% of phenotypic variance, respectively. A
   combination of APR QTL from the two parents resulted in transgressive
   segregants expressing higher levels of resistance than Pavon 76. Our
   results indicate that it is possible to accumulate several minor
   resistance genes each with a small to intermediate effect resulting in a
   variety that exhibits negligible disease levels even under high stem
   rust pressure.}},

Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{In flowering plants, double fertilization of the female gametes, the egg
   and the central cell, initiates seed development to give rise to a
   diploid embryo and the triploid endosperm. In the absence of
   fertilization, the FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED Polycomb Repressive
   Complex2 (FIS-PRC2) represses this developmental process by histone
   methylation of certain target genes. The FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED
   (FIS) class genes MEDEA (MEA) and FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM
   (FIE) encode two of the core components of this complex. In addition,
   DNA methylation establishes and maintains the repression of gene
   activity, for instance via DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1), which
   maintains methylation of symmetric CpG residues. Here, we demonstrate
   that Arabidopsis MET1 interacts with MEA in vitro and in a yeast
   two-hybrid assay, similar to the previously identified interaction of
   the mammalian homologues DNMT1 and EZH2. MET1 and MEA share overlapping
   expression patterns in reproductive tissues before and after
   fertilization, a prerequisite for an interaction in vivo. Importantly, a
   much higher percentage of central cells initiate endosperm development
   in the absence of fertilization in mea-1/MEA;met1-3/MET1 as compared to
   mea-1/MEA mutant plants. In addition, DNA methylation at the PHERES1 and
   MEA loci, imprinted target genes of the FIS-PRC2, was affected in the
   mea-1 mutant compared with wild-type embryos. In conclusion, our data
   suggest a mechanistic link between two major epigenetic pathways
   involved in histone and DNA methylation in plants by physical
   interaction of MET1 with the FIS-PRC2 core component MEA. This concerted
   action is relevant for the repression of seed development in the absence
   of fertilization.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic engineering of plants for phytoremediation is thought to be
   possible based on results using model plants expressing genes involved
   in heavy metal resistance, which improve the plant's tolerance of heavy
   metals and accumulation capacity. The next step of progress in this
   technology requires the genetic engineering of plants that produce large
   amounts of biomass and the testing of these transgenic plants in
   contaminated soils. Thus, we transformed a sterile line of poplar
   Populus alba X P. tremula var. glandulosa with a heavy metal resistance
   gene, ScYCF1 (yeast cadmium factor 1), which encodes a transporter that
   sequesters toxic metal(loid)s into the vacuoles of budding yeast, and
   tested these transgenic plants in soil taken from a closed mine site
   contaminated with multiple toxic metal(loid)s under greenhouse and field
   conditions. The YCF1-expressing transgenic poplar plants exhibited
   enhanced growth, reduced toxicity symptoms, and increased Cd content in
   the aerial tissue compared to the non-transgenic plants. Furthermore,
   the plants accumulated increased amounts of Cd, Zn, and Pb in the root,
   because they could establish an extensive root system in mine tailing
   soil. These results suggest that the generation of YCF1-expressing
   transgenic poplar represents the first step towards producing plants for
   phytoremediation. The YCF1-expressing poplar may be useful for
   phytostabilization and phytoattenuation, especially in highly
   contaminated regions, where wild-type plants cannot survive. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The urgency of estimating the impact of climate risks on the financial
   system is increasingly recognized among scholars and practitioners. By
   adopting a network approach to financial dependencies, we look at how
   climate policy risk might propagate through the financial system. We
   develop a network-based climate stress-test methodology and apply it to
   large Euro Area banks in a `green' and a `brown' scenario. We find that
   direct and indirect exposures to climate-policy-relevant sectors
   represent a large portion of investors' equity portfolios, especially
   for investment and pension funds. Additionally, the portion of banks'
   loan portfolios exposed to these sectors is comparable to banks'
   capital. Our results suggest that climate policy timing matters. An
   early and stable policy framework would allow for smooth asset value
   adjustments and lead to potential net winners and losers. In contrast, a
   late and abrupt policy framework could have adverse systemic
   consequences.}},

Title = {{On the combined effect of soil fertility and topography on tree growth
   in subtropical forest ecosystems-a study from SE China}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   The aim of our research was to understand small-scale effects of
   topography and soil fertility on tree growth in a forest biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment in subtropical SE China.
   Methods
   Geomorphometric terrain analyses were carried out at a spatial
   resolution of 5 x 5 m. Soil samples of different depth increments and
   data on tree height were collected from a total of 566 plots (667 m(2)
   each). The soils were analyzed for carbon (soil organic carbon {[}SOC]),
   nitrogen, acidity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations
   and base saturation as soil fertility attributes. All plots were
   classified into geomorphological units. Analyses of variance and linear
   regressions were applied to all terrain, soil fertility and tree growth
   attributes.
   Important Findings
   In general, young and shallow soils and relatively small differences in
   stable soil properties suggest that soil erosion has truncated the soils
   to a large extent over the whole area of the experiment. This explains
   the concurrently increasing CEC and SOC stocks downslope, in hollows and
   in valleys. However, colluvial, carbon-rich sediments are missing widely
   due to the convexity of the foot-slopes caused by uplift and removal of
   eroded sediments by adjacent waterways. The results showed that soil
   fertility is mainly influenced by topography. Monte-Carlo flow
   accumulation (MCCA), curvature, slope and aspect significantly affected
   soil fertility. Furthermore, soil fertility was affected by the
   different geomorphological positions on the experimental sites with
   ridge and spur positions showing lower exchangeable base cation
   contents, especially potassium (K), due to leaching. This
   geomorphological effect of soil fertility is most pronounced in the
   topsoil and decreases when considering the subsoil down to 50 cm depth.
   Few soil fertility attributes affect tree height after 1-2 years of
   growth, among which C stocks proved to be most important while pH(KCl)
   and CEC only played minor roles. Nevertheless, soil acidity and a high
   proportion of Al on the exchange complex affected tree height even after
   only 1-2 years growth. Hence, our study showed that forest nutrition is
   coupled to a recycling of litter nutrients, and does not only depend on
   subsequent supply of nutrients from the mineral soil. Besides soil
   fertility, topography affected tree height. We found that especially
   MCCA as indicator of water availability affected tree growth at
   small-scale, as well as aspect. Overall, our synthesis on the
   interrelation between fertility, topography and tree growth in a
   subtropical forest ecosystem in SE China showed that topographic
   heterogeneity lead to ecological gradients across geomorphological
   positions. In this respect, small-scale soil-plant interactions in a
   young forest can serve as a driver for the future development of
   vegetation and biodiversity control on soil fertility. In addition, it
   shows that terrain attributes should be accounted for in ecological
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The wheat gene Lr34 confers durable and partial field resistance against
   the obligate biotrophic, pathogenic rust fungi and powdery mildew in
   adult wheat plants. The resistant Lr34 allele evolved after wheat
   domestication through two gain-of-function mutations in an ATP-binding
   cassette transporter gene. An Lr34-like fungal disease resistance with a
   similar broad-spectrum specificity and durability has not been described
   in other cereals. Here, we transformed the resistant Lr34 allele into
   the japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare. Transgenic rice plants expressing
   Lr34 showed increased resistance against multiple isolates of the
   hemibiotrophic pathogen Magnaportheoryzae, the causal agent of rice
   blast disease. Host cell invasion during the biotrophic growth phase of
   rice blast was delayed in Lr34-expressing rice plants, resulting in
   smaller necrotic lesions on leaves. Lines with Lr34 also developed a
   typical, senescence-based leaf tip necrosis (LTN) phenotype. Development
   of LTN during early seedling growth had a negative impact on formation
   of axillary shoots and spikelets in some transgenic lines. One
   transgenic line developed LTN only at adult plant stage which was
   correlated with lower Lr34 expression levels at seedling stage. This
   line showed normal tiller formation and more importantly, disease
   resistance in this particular line was not compromised. Interestingly,
   Lr34 in rice is effective against a hemibiotrophic pathogen with a
   lifestyle and infection strategy that is different from obligate
   biotrophic rusts and mildew fungi. Lr34 might therefore be used as a
   source in rice breeding to improve broad-spectrum disease resistance
   against the most devastating fungal disease of rice.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Nanoparticle exposure in utero might not be a major concern
   yet, but it could become more important with the increasing application
   of nanomaterials in consumer and medical products. Several epidemiologic
   and invitro studies have shown that nanoparticles can have potential
   toxic effects. However, nanoparticles also offer the opportunity to
   develop new therapeutic strategies to treat specifically either the
   pregnant mother or the fetus. Previous studies mainly addressed whether
   nanoparticles are able to cross the placental barrier. However, the
   transport mechanisms underlying nanoparticle translocation across the
   placenta are still unknown.
   OBJECTIVES: In this study we examined which transport mechanisms
   underlie the placental transfer of nanoparticles.
   METHODS: We used the exvivo human placental perfusion model to analyze
   the bidirectional transfer of plain and carboxylate modified polystyrene
   particles in a size range between 50 and 300 nm.
   RESULTS: We observed that the transport of polystyrene particles in the
   fetal to maternal direction was significantly higher than for the
   maternal to fetal direction. Regardless of their ability to cross the
   placental barrier and the direction of perfusion, all polystyrene
   particles accumulated in the syncytiotrophoblast of the placental
   tissue.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the syncytiotrophoblast is the
   key player in regulating nanoparticle transport across the human
   placenta. The main mechanism underlying this translocation is not based
   on passive diffusion, but is likely to involve an active,
   energy-dependent transport pathway. These findings will be important for
   reproductive toxicology as well as for pharmaceutical engineering of new
   drug carriers.}},

Title = {{Classifying diseases and remedies in ethnomedicine and ethnopharmacology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{514-519}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ethnopharmacology focuses on the
   understanding of local and indigenous use of medicines and therefore an
   emic approach is inevitable. Often, however, standard biomedical disease
   classifications are used to describe and analyse local diseases and
   remedies. Standard classifications might be a valid tool for
   cross-cultural comparisons and bioprospecting purposes but are not
   suitable to understand the local perception of disease and use of
   remedies. Different standard disease classification systems exist but
   their suitability for cross-cultural comparisons of ethnomedical data
   has never been assessed. Depending on the research focus, (I)
   ethnomedical, (II) cross-cultural, and (III) bioprospecting, we provide
   suggestions for the use of specific classification systems.
   Materials and methods: We analyse three different standard biomedical
   classification systems (the International Classification of Diseases
   (ICD); the Economic Botany Data Collection Standard (EBDCS); and the
   International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC)), and discuss their
   value for categorizing diseases of ethnomedical systems and their
   suitability for cross-cultural research in ethnopharmacology. Moreover,
   based on the biomedical uses of all approved plant derived biomedical
   drugs, we propose a biomedical therapy-based classification system as a
   guide for the discovery of drugs from ethnopharmacological sources.
   Results: Widely used standards, such as the International Classification
   of Diseases (ICD) by the WHO and the Economic Botany Data Collection
   Standard (EBDCS) are either technically challenging due to a
   categorisation system based on clinical examinations, which are usually
   not possible during field research (ICD) or lack clear biomedical
   criteria combining disorders and medical effects in an imprecise and
   confusing way (EBDCS).
   The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), also accepted
   by the WHO, has more in common with ethnomedical reality than the ICD or
   the EBDCS, as the categories are designed according to patient's
   perceptions and are less influenced by clinical medicine. Since
   diagnostic tools are not required, medical ethnobotanists and
   ethnopharmacologists can easily classify reported symptoms and
   complaints with the ICPC in one of the ``chapters{''} based on 17 body
   systems, psychological and social problems. Also the biomedical uses of
   plant-derived drugs are classifiable into 17 broad organ- and
   therapy-based use-categories but can easily be divided into more
   specific subcategories.
   Conclusions: Depending on the research focus (I-III) we propose the
   following classification systems:
   I. Ethnomedicine: Ethnomedicine is culture-bound and local
   classifications have to be understood from an emic perspective.
   Consequently, the application of prefabricated, ``one-size fits all{''}
   biomedical classification schemes is of limited value.?
   II. Cross-cultural analysis: The ICPC is a suitable standard that can be
   applied but modified as required.?
   III. Bioprospecting: We suggest a biomedical therapy-driven
   classification system with currently 17 use-categories based on
   biomedical uses of all approved plant derived natural product drugs.?

Abstract = {{In dryland ecosystems, mobility is essential for both wildlife and
   people to access unpredictable and spatially heterogeneous resources,
   particularly in the face of climate change. Fences can prevent
   connectivity vital for this mobility. There are recent calls for
   large-scale barrier fencing interventions to address human-wildlife
   conflict and illegal resource extraction. Fencing has costs and benefits
   to people and wildlife. However, the evidence available for facilitating
   sound decision-making for fencing initiatives is limited, particularly
   for drylands. We identify six research areas that are key to informing
   evaluations of fencing initiatives: economics, edge permeability,
   reserve design, connectivity, ecosystem services and communities.Policy
   implications. Implementing this research agenda to evaluate fencing
   interventions in dryland ecosystems will enable better management and
   policy decisions. The United Nations Conventions on Migratory Species
   (CMS) and to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) are appropriate
   international agreements for moving this agenda forward and leading the
   development of policies and guidelines on fencing in drylands.

Abstract = {{Grape (Vitis vinifera) accumulates various polyphenolic compounds, which
   protect against environmental stresses, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C)
   light and pathogens. In this study, we looked at the transcriptome and
   metabolome in grape berry skin after UV-C irradiation, which
   demonstrated the effectiveness of omics approaches to clarify important
   traits of grape. We performed transcriptome analysis using a genome-wide
   microarray, which revealed 238 genes up-regulated more than 5-fold by
   UV-C light. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology terms showed that genes
   encoding stilbene synthase, a key enzyme for resveratrol synthesis, were
   enriched in the up-regulated genes. We performed metabolome analysis
   using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry,
   and 2,012 metabolite peaks, including unidentified peaks, were detected.
   Principal component analysis using the peaks showed that only one
   metabolite peak, identified as resveratrol, was highly induced by UV-C
   light. We updated the metabolic pathway map of grape in the Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and in the KaPPA-View
   4 KEGG system, then projected the transcriptome and metabolome data on a
   metabolic pathway map. The map showed specific induction of the
   resveratrol synthetic pathway by UV-C light. Our results showed that
   multiomics is a powerful tool to elucidate the accumulation mechanisms
   of secondary metabolites, and updated systems, such as KEGG and
   KaPPA-View 4 KEGG for grape, can support such studies.}},

   networks. Drawing on material from semi-structured interviews,
   participant observation and documents it considers the value of this
   framework by examining the mobility of the sustainability agenda of the
   Winter Olympic Games 2014 in Sochi, Russia. The paper shows how
   sustainability policies were packaged and mobilised to flow to Russia
   (transportation), how ineffective governance arrangements, a lack of
   institutional controls and time pressure altered them (transformation)
   and how the results fell far short of initial bid commitments
   (translation). As such, it sheds light onto the multiple immobilities
   and mutations that come with the attempts to mobilise policies.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the important role of supraglacial debris in ablation, knowledge
   of debris thickness on Himalayan glaciers is sparse. A recently
   developed method based on reanalysis data and thermal band satellite
   imagery has proved to be potentially suitable for debris thickness
   estimation without the need for detailed field data. In this study, we
   further develop the method and discuss possibilities and limitations
   arising from its application to a glacier in the Himalaya with scarce in
   situ data. Surface temperature patterns are consistent for 13 scenes of
   Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)
   and Landsat 7 imagery and correlate well with incoming shortwave
   radiation and air temperature. We use an energy-balance approach to
   subtract these radiation or air temperature effects, in order to
   estimate debris thickness patterns as a function of surface temperature.
   Both incoming shortwave and longwave radiation are estimated with
   reasonable accuracy when applying parameterizations and reanalysis data.
   However, the model likely underestimates debris thickness, probably due
   to incorrect representation of vertical debris temperature profiles, the
   rate of heat storage and turbulent sensible heat flux. Moreover, the
   uncertainty of the result was found to increase significantly with
   thicker debris, a promising result since ablation is enhanced by thin
   debris of 1-2 cm.}},

Abstract = {{Trace element (TE) contamination of soils is a worldwide problem.
   However, although not considered safe anymore for food production
   without clean-up, many of these soils may still be used to produce
   biomass for non-food purposes such as biochar. Exploring the suitability
   of such biochar for the amendment of low-fertility soil, we investigated
   growth and metal accumulation of ryegrass (Lolium perenne, var. Calibra)
   as well as soil microbial abundance on a non-contaminated soil after
   amendment with biochar from birch (Betula pendula) wood produced on TE
   contaminated soil in comparison to a treatment with birch wood biochar
   originating from non-contaminated soil. Biochars were produced from both
   feedstocks by pyrolysis at two temperatures: 450 and 700 degrees C.
   During the pyrolysis, in contrast to Cu, Fe, Mg, K, Mn and P, the
   elements Cd, Pb, S and Na volatilized. The root biomass of the biochar
   treated plants was lower than that of the non-amended plants, while that
   of the shoot was higher. Plant shoot K and Zn concentrations were
   increased significantly by up to 7- and 3.3-fold respectively. For P.
   Mg, Mn, Fe and Cu no significant increase in shoot concentration could
   be detected. Neither the TE-contaminated biochar, nor the
   non-contaminated biochar had adverse effect on the bacterial community
   of the soil. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The magnitude and extent of global change during the Cenozoic is
   remarkable, yet the impacts of these global changes on the biodiversity
   and evolutionary dynamics of species diversification remain poorly
   understood. To investigate this question, we combine paleontological and
   neontological data for the angiosperm order Fagales, an ecologically
   important clade of about 1370 species of trees with an exceptional
   fossil record. We show differences in patterns of accumulation of
   generic diversity, species richness, and turnover rates for Fagales.
   Generic diversity evolved rapidly since the Late Cretaceous and peaked
   during the Eocene or Oligocene. Turnover rates were high during periods
   of extreme global climate change, but relatively low when the climate
   remained stable. Species richness accumulated gradually throughout the
   Cenozoic, possibly at an accelerated pace after theMiddleMiocene.
   Species diversification occurred in new environments: Quercoids
   radiating in Oligocene subtropical seasonally arid habitats,
   Casuarinaceae in Australian pyrophytic biomes, and Betula in Late
   Neogene holarctic habitats. These radiations were counterbalanced by
   regional extinctions in Late Neogene mesic warm-temperate forests. Thus,
   the overall diversification at species level is linked to regional
   radiations of clades with appropriate ecologies exploiting newly
   available habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Biological soil crusts (BSCs) provide important ecosystem services in
   dryland regions, including erosion control and contribution to nitrogen
   and CO2 fixation. As soil microorganisms are still rarely studied within
   the context of biodiversity planning, we describe, as a contribution to
   the Soil Crust International project, an approach that addresses this
   gap in biodiversity assessments. The purpose of the present study was a
   characterization of prokaryotic communities of BSCs formed by two
   species of lichenized fungi, Psora decipiens and Toninia sedifolia, in
   relation to surrounding BSCs and the below-crust soil layer from
   Tabernas basin (Almeria, Spain). Microbial community profiles were
   determined using 454 pyrosequencing targeting the V4 hypervariable
   region of the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene. The majority of the
   65,497 sequences obtained belonged to Proteobacteria (mainly
   Alphaproteobacteria), Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria.
   Cyanobacteria were more abundant at the soil surface but rare in
   below-crust soils, whilst below-crust soils harbored significantly more
   Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes, Planctomycetes and
   Armatimonadetes. Additionally, terricolous lichens were investigated
   using fluorescence in situ hybridization in conjunction with confocal
   laser scanning microscopy, the objective being to illustrate bacterial
   niches in BSC-forming lichens. Bacteria were mainly present at the upper
   cortex of the squamules and attachment organs. Our findings indicate
   that the composition of soil prokaryotes varies at a small scale not
   only in adjacent soil layers but also in BSC-forming lichen species.
   Furthermore, bacteria were shown to be attached to fungal structures,
   probably representing a case of fungal-bacterial interaction.}},

Title = {{Abiotic stress-induced accumulation of raffinose in Arabidopsis leaves
   is mediated by a single raffinose synthase (RS5, At5g40390)}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: The sucrosylgalactoside oligosaccharide raffinose (Raf,
   Suc-Gal(1)) accumulates in Arabidopsis leaves in response to a myriad of
   abiotic stresses. Whilst galactinol synthases (GolS), the first
   committed enzyme in Raf biosynthesis are well characterised in
   Arabidopsis, little is known of the second biosynthetic gene/enzyme
   raffinose synthase (RS). Conflicting reports suggest the existence of
   either one or six abiotic stress-inducible RSs (RS-1 to -6) occurring in
   Arabidopsis. Indirect evidence points to At5g40390 being responsible for
   low temperature-induced Raf accumulation in Arabidopsis leaves.
   Results: By heterologously expressing At5g40390 in E. coli, we
   demonstrate that crude extracts synthesise Raf in vitro, contrary to
   empty vector controls. Using two independent loss-of-function mutants
   for At5g40390 (rs 5-1 and 5-2), we confirm that this RS is indeed
   responsible for Raf accumulation during low temperature-acclimation (4
   C), as previously reported. Surprisingly, leaves of mutant plants also
   fail to accumulate any Raf under diverse abiotic stresses including
   water-deficit, high salinity, heat shock, and methyl viologen-induced
   oxidative stress. Correlated to the lack of Raf under these abiotic
   stress conditions, both mutant plants lack the typical stress-induced
   RafS activity increase observed in the leaves of wild-type plants.
   Conclusions: Collectively our findings point to a single abiotic
   stress-induced RS isoform (RS5, At5g40390) being responsible for Raf
   biosynthesis in Arabidopsis leaves. However, they do not support a
   single RS hypothesis since the seeds of both mutant plants still
   contained Raf, albeit at 0.5-fold lower concentration than seeds from
   wild-type plants, suggesting the existence of at least one other
   seed-specific RS. These results also unambiguously discount the
   existence of six stress-inducible RS isoforms suggested by recent
   reports.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Whatever criteria are used to measure evolutionary success - species
   numbers, geographic range, ecological abundance, ecological and life
   history diversity, background diversification rates, or the presence of
   rapidly evolving clades - the legume family is one of the most
   successful lineages of flowering plants. Despite this, we still know
   rather little about the dynamics of lineage and species diversification
   across the family through the Cenozoic, or about the underlying drivers
   of diversification. There have been few attempts to estimate net species
   diversification rates or underlying speciation and extinction rates for
   legume clades, to test whether among-lineage variation in
   diversification rates deviates from null expectations, or to locate
   species diversification rate shifts on specific branches of the legume
   phylogenetic tree. In this study, time-calibrated phylogenetic trees for
   a set of species-rich legume clades - Calliandra, lndigofereae, Lupinus,
   Mimosa and Robinieae - and for the legume family as a whole, are used to
   explore how we might approach these questions. These clades are analysed
   using recently developed maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to
   detect species diversification rate shifts and test for among-lineage
   variation in speciation, extinction and net diversification rates.
   Possible explanations for rate shifts in terms of extrinsic factors
   and/or intrinsic trait evolution are discussed. In addition, several
   methodological issues and limitations associated with these analyses are
   highlighted emphasizing the potential to improve our understanding of
   the evolutionary dynamics of legume diversification by using much more
   densely sampled phylogenetic trees that integrate information across
   broad taxonomic, geographical and temporal levels. (C) 2013 SAAB.

Abstract = {{Changes in terrestrial vegetation patterns during the Valanginian (Early
   Cretaceous) and their link to major climatic and environmental
   alterations are poorly studied. In this study, the spatial and temporal
   changes in plant community structure are reconstructed based on spore
   pollen records from two mid-latitude sites located in the Mid-Polish
   Trough (MPT, central Poland), and the Vocontian Basin (VB, southeast
   France). Stratigraphic control is provided by delta C-13(carb)
   chemostratigraphy and calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy.
   Reconstruction of hinterland vegetation is based on palynological
   investigations of 83 samples from hemipelagic (VB) and marginal marine
   (MPT) sediments rich in terrestrial palynomorphs. A total of 45
   palynomorph taxa were identified at generic level (30 spores, 15
   pollen). Vegetation around the MPT was dominated by
   araucarian/cupressacean conifers while that surrounding the VB was
   dominated by drought-resistant cheirolepidiacean conifers. At both sites
   the understorey and/or vegetation of open areas was dominated by
   pteridophytes. An early Valanginian gradual trend towards humid
   conditions at the MPT, well expressed by a distinct increase in the
   spore pollen ratio, culminates in a short-lived spore-maximum
   stratigraphically located at the lower/upper Valanginian boundary. It is
   characterized by low conifer abundances and high abundances of the fern
   spore taxa Cyathidites, Leiotriletes and Gleicheniidites accompanied by
   enhanced abundances of the pteridosperm pollen Vitreisporites pallidus,
   whose parent plants are assumed to be indicative of swamp habitats. The
   spore-maximum is coeval to a similar peak observed in the VB,
   characterized by essentially the same taxa. Here, the spore-maximum is
   preceded by a protracted phase of arid conditions, characterized by low
   spore abundances and exceptionally high numbers of the cheirolepidiacean
   conifer pollen Classopollis. Changes in moisture, identified as the key
   climatic factor determining trends and turnovers in vegetation, were
   probably controlled by a monsoonal circulation. The supra-regional humid
   phase expressed by the coeval spore maxima was probably induced by an
   intensified monsoonal climate. The temporal influence of a northern
   hemisphere arid belt at the VB, under the influence of the subtropical
   high-pressure belt, may have caused the temporal drying not affecting
   the MPT site, located further north. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{High relatedness among interacting individuals has generally been
   considered a precondition for the evolution of altruism. However,
   kin-selection theory also predicts the evolution of altruism when
   relatedness is low, as long as the cost of the altruistic act is minor
   compared with its benefit. Here, we demonstrate evidence for a low-cost
   altruistic act in bacteria. We investigated Escherichia coli responding
   to the attack of an obligately lytic phage by committing suicide in
   order to prevent parasite transmission to nearby relatives. We found
   that bacterial suicide provides large benefits to survivors at marginal
   costs to committers. The cost of suicide was low, because infected cells
   are moribund, rapidly dying upon phage infection, such that no more
   opportunity for reproduction remains. As a consequence of its marginal
   cost, host suicide was selectively favoured even when relatedness
   between committers and survivors approached zero. Altogether, our
   findings demonstrate that low-cost suicide can evolve with ease,
   represents an effective host-defence strategy, and seems to be
   widespread among microbes. Moreover, low-cost suicide might also occur
   in higher organisms as exemplified by infected social insect workers
   leaving the colony to die in isolation.}},

Abstract = {{In house mice, genetic compatibility is influenced by the t haplotype, a
   driving selfish genetic element with a recessive lethal allele, imposing
   fundamental costs on mate choice decisions. Here, we evaluate the cost
   of genetic incompatibility and its implication for mate choice in a wild
   house mice population. In laboratory reared mice, we detected no
   fertility (number of embryos) or fecundity (ability to conceive) costs
   of the t, and yet we found a high cost of genetic incompatibility:
   heterozygote crosses produced 40\% smaller birth litter sizes because of
   prenatal mortality. Surprisingly, transmission of t in crosses using +/t
   males was influenced by female genotype, consistent with postcopulatory
   female choice for + sperm in +/t females. Analysis of paternity patterns
   in a wild population of house mice showed that +/t females were more
   likely than +/+ females to have offspring sired by +/+ males, and unlike
   +/+ females, paternity of their offspring was not influenced by +/t male
   frequency, further supporting mate choice for genetic compatibility. As
   the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is physically linked to the
   t, we investigated whether females could potentially use variation at
   the MHC to identify male genotype at the sperm or individual level. A
   unique MHC haplotype is linked to the t haplotype. This MHC haplotype
   could allow the recognition of t and enable pre- and postcopulatory mate
   choice for genetic compatibility. Alternatively, the MHC itself could be
   the target of mate choice for genetic compatibility. We predict that
   mate choice for genetic compatibility will be difficult to find in many
   systems, as only weak fertilization biases were found despite an
   exceptionally high cost of genetic incompatibility.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The cryosphere in mountain regions is rapidly declining, a trend that is
   expected to accelerate over the next several decades due to
   anthropogenic climate change. A cascade of effects will result,
   extending from mountains to lowlands with associated impacts on human
   livelihood, economy, and ecosystems. With rising air temperatures and
   increased radiative forcing, glaciers will become smaller and, in some
   cases, disappear, the area of frozen ground will diminish, the ratio of
   snow to rainfall will decrease, and the timing and magnitude of both
   maximum and minimum streamflow will change. These changes will affect
   erosion rates, sediment, and nutrient flux, and the biogeochemistry of
   rivers and proglacial lakes, all of which influence water quality,
   aquatic habitat, and biotic communities. Changes in the length of the
   growing season will allow low-elevation plants and animals to expand
   their ranges upward. Slope failures due to thawing alpine permafrost,
   and outburst floods from glacier-and moraine-dammed lakes will threaten
   downstream populations.Societies even well beyond the mountains depend
   on meltwater from glaciers and snow for drinking water supplies,
   irrigation, mining, hydropower, agriculture, and recreation. Here, we
   review and, where possible, quantify the impacts of anticipated climate
   change on the alpine cryosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere, and
   consider the implications for adaptation to a future of mountains
   without permanent snow and ice.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Stomata control gaseous fluxes between the internal leaf air spaces and
   the external atmosphere and, therefore, play a pivotal role in
   regulating CO2 uptake for photosynthesis as well as water loss through
   transpiration. Guard cells, which flank the stomata, undergo adjustments
   in volume, resulting in changes in pore aperture. Stomatal opening is
   mediated by the complex regulation of ion transport and solute
   biosynthesis. Ion transport is exceptionally well understood, whereas
   our knowledge of guard cell metabolism remains limited, despite several
   decades of research. In this review, we evaluate the current literature
   on metabolism in guard cells, particularly the roles of starch, sucrose,
   and malate. We explore the possible origins of sucrose, including guard
   cell photosynthesis, and discuss new evidence that points to multiple
   processes and plasticity in guard cell metabolism that enable these
   cells to function effectively to maintain optimal stomatal aperture. We
   also discuss the new tools, techniques, and approaches available for
   further exploring and potentially manipulating guard cell metabolism to
   improve plant water use and productivity.}},

Journal = {{NEW PHYTOLOGIST}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{212}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{320-332}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Cereal crops produce a large part of the globally consumed food and
   feed. Because of the constant presence of devastating pathogens, the
   molecular characterization of disease resistance is a major research
   area and highly relevant for breeding. There has been recent and
   accelerating progress in the understanding of three distinct resistance
   mechanisms in cereals: resistance conferred by plasma membrane-localized
   receptor proteins; race-specific resistance conferred by intracellular
   immune receptors; and quantitative disease resistance. Intracellular
   immune receptors provide a particularly rich source for evolutionary
   studies, and have, for example, resulted in the recent discovery of a
   novel detection mechanism based on integrated decoy domains.
   Evolutionary studies have also revealed the origins of active resistance
   genes in both wild progenitors of today's cereals as well as in
   cultivated forms. In addition, independent evolution of orthologous
   genes in related cereals has resulted in resistance to different
   pathogen species. Quantitative resistance genes have been best
   characterized in wheat. The quantitative resistance genes identified so
   far in wheat encode transporter proteins or unusual kinase proteins. The
   recent discoveries in these three different resistance mechanisms have
   contributed to the basic molecular understanding of cereal immunity
   against pathogens and have suggested novel applications for resistance
   breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Stomata control the exchange of CO2 and water vapor in land plants.
   Thus, whereas a constant supply of CO2 is required to maintain adequate
   rates of photosynthesis, the accompanying water losses must be tightly
   regulated to prevent dehydration and undesired metabolic changes.
   Accordingly, the uptake or release of ions and metabolites from guard
   cells is necessary to achieve normal stomatal function. The AtQUAC1, an
   R-type anion channel responsible for the release of malate from guard
   cells, is essential for efficient stomatal closure. Here, we demonstrate
   that mutant plants lacking AtQUAC1 accumulated higher levels of malate
   and fumarate. These mutant plants not only display slower stomatal
   closure in response to increased CO2 concentration and dark but are also
   characterized by improved mesophyll conductance. These responses were
   accompanied by increases in both photosynthesis and respiration rates,
   without affecting the activity of photosynthetic and respiratory enzymes
   and the expression of other transporter genes in guard cells, which
   ultimately led to improved growth. Collectively, our results highlight
   that the transport of organic acids plays a key role in plant cell
   metabolism and demonstrate that AtQUAC1 reduce diffusive limitations to
   photosynthesis, which, at least partially, explain the observed
   increments in growth under well-watered conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, hydrologic modeling of surface water resources has mainly
   focused on simulating the hydrologic cycle at local to regional
   catchment modeling domains. There now exists a level of maturity among
   the catchment, global water security, and land surface modeling
   communities such that these communities are converging toward
   continental domain hydrologic models. This commentary, written from a
   catchment hydrology community perspective, provides a review of progress
   in each community toward this achievement, identifies common challenges
   the communities face, and details immediate and specific areas in which
   these communities can mutually benefit one another from the convergence
   of their research perspectives. Those include: (1) creating new
   incentives and infrastructure to report and share model inputs, outputs,
   and parameters in data services and open access, machine-independent
   formats for model replication or reanalysis; (2) ensuring that
   hydrologic models have: sufficient complexity to represent the dominant
   physical processes and adequate representation of anthropogenic impacts
   on the terrestrial water cycle, a process-based approach to model
   parameter estimation, and appropriate parameterizations to represent
   large-scale fluxes and scaling behavior; (3) maintaining a balance
   between model complexity and data availability as well as uncertainties;
   and (4) quantifying and communicating significant advancements toward

Abstract = {{Hydrologic connectivity is the linkage of separate regions of a
   catchment via water flow. Knowledge of hillslope-stream connectivity
   (both at the surface and in the subsurface) is essential for
   understanding and predicting runoff responses and streamwater quality.
   Connectivity can be very dynamic: hillslopes may connect to the stream
   only during certain events or seasons. While surface connectivity is
   often discussed, particularly in the context of sediment transport,
   subsurface connectivity is more difficult to describe and assess. This
   difficulty has led to a wide variety in methodologies that are used in
   various contexts. Field approaches have focused on intensive monitoring
   of processes on the hillslope or the fingerprint of connectivity in the
   stream. Combining experimental studies with modeling allows for testing
   of hypotheses with respect to thresholds and controls on connectivity,
   and extrapolation from the hillslope scale to the catchment scale.
   However, as most modeling approaches are based on datasets from a few
   intensively studied hillslopes, this carries the inherent risk of
   oversimplification because it assumes that the observed hillslope
   responses are representative for the catchment or even the region.
   Focussed efforts on catchment scale assessment of hillslope-stream
   connectivity, as well as site intercomparisons and the search for
   similarity measures may allow us to capture the wider picture of the
   mechanisms and factors that control hillslope-stream connectivity, and
   its effects on flow and transport at the catchment scale. This overview
   focuses on how hillslope-stream connectivity has been studied and
   describes the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of the different
   methods. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Competition, facilitation and environmental severity shape the

Abstract = {{Understanding the relative contribution of local and regional processes
   to local species richness is an important ecological question and a
   subject of controversy between macroecologists and community ecologists.
   We test the hypothesis that the contribution of local and regional
   processes is dependent on environmental conditions and that the effect
   of regional processes should be the highest in communities from
   intermediate positions along environmental severity gradients due to the
   importance of facilitation. We used the recently developed log-ratio
   method to analyze the relationship between local species richness (LSR)
   and regional species richness (RSR) for 13 plant communities from 4
   habitat types of France (coastal sand dunes, oceanic heathlands, alpine
   grasslands, lowland calcareous grasslands). Each habitat type was split
   in 3-4 communities using multivariate analyses to identify the relative
   importance of stress, disturbance, competition, and facilitation
   functioning within the 13 communities. We found that the LSR/RSR
   relationship was highly dependent on environmental conditions with
   saturated communities occurring more frequently than unsaturated
   communities highlighting the relative importance of local drivers on
   species richness. We argued that competition was most likely the main
   source of community saturation whilst facilitation likely contributed to
   enhancing the importance of the regional species pool for all habitat
   types. However, the effect of facilitation might be stronger in the
   disturbed than in the stressed systems because unsaturated curves were
   only observed in the former conditions. In extreme conditions of
   disturbance LSR was only controlled by the intensity of disturbance.
   This effect was not observed in extreme stress conditions. Our study
   provides support for the emerging balance theory that both local and
   regional processes are important in nature with their relative
   contribution depending on environmental conditions. Additionally, this
   synthesis strongly suggests that facilitation contributes to an
   important process - the influence of regional species pool on local
   species richness.}},

Title = {{Diversity patterns of ferns along elevational gradients in Andean

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY \& DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{13-24}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biodiversity is perceived to decline from lowlands towards
   mountain peaks and away from the Equator towards the Poles, but
   supporting data for most groups of organisms are lacking, especially at
   the local scale.
   Aims: Elevational gradients of fern species richness in tropical forest
   habitats were analysed to test the hypotheses that fern species
   composition patterns were similar between elevational gradients, that
   total species richness of complete elevational gradients gradually
   declined due to changing climatic conditions with increasing distance
   from the Equator, and that the elevation of highest species richness
   gradually declined with increasing latitude.
   Methods: We used plot-based elevational fern species richness surveys
   compiled from recent field work and own published studies, between 18
   degrees N and 18 degrees S along the Andean mountain range, and compared
   the transects of patterns of species richness and composition, and
   distribution of taxa.
   Results: Taxonomic composition was highly similar among tropical
   regions. Elevational richness patterns were symmetrically hump-shaped
   and overall richness was virtually equal along most of the tropical
   latitudinal gradient. In contrast, the subtropical localities at the
   edges of our study area, ca. 18 degrees N and 18 degrees S, showed
   strikingly different patterns from those in the tropical zone.
   Conclusions: Within the tropics, there appears to be no latitudinal
   diversity gradient of ferns at the local scale. We suggest that, in
   tropical habitats, species richness of ferns at the local scale is
   limited by the number of species that can co-occur and that the
   available niche space is saturated.}},

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{432-437}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Molecular characterization of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) is of
   great interest to understand the formation and behavior of these
   increasingly abundant materials in the environment. Two molecular marker
   methods have often been used to characterize and trace PyOM: polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and benzenepolycarboxylic acid (BPCA)
   analysis. Since both methods target pyrogenic polycyclic compounds, we
   investigated the linkages between the two approaches using chars that
   were produced under controlled conditions. Rye and maize straws and
   their analogues charred at 300, 400 and 500 degrees C, respectively,
   were thus analyzed with both methods. Moreover, we also measured BPCAs
   directly on the lipid extracts, on which PAHs were analyzed, and on the
   respective extraction residues, too. Both methods revealed important
   features of the chars, in particular the increasing degree of aromatic
   condensation with increasing highest heating temperature (MU). The
   overlap between the two methods was identified in the lipid fraction,
   where the proportion of benzenetricarboxylic acids (B3CAs) correlated
   with PAH abundance. The results confirmed the validity and
   complementarity of the two molecular marker methods, which will likely
   continue to play a crucial role in PyOM research due to the recent
   developments of compound-specific PAM and BPCA stable carbon (delta
   C-13) and radiocarbon (C-14) isotope methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effects of elevation on surface water fluxes in dry alpine grassland
   ecosystems were investigated along an elevational transect between 1000
   and 2000m above sea level established in the Vinschgau/Venosta valley, a
   relatively dry region in the Italian Alps. The GEOtop-dv hydrological
   model was employed in point-scale mode to model the effects of the
   elevation gradient on snow water equivalent (SWE), soil water content
   (), evapotranspiration (ET), aboveground biomass (B-ag) and water use
   efficiency (WUE) in different climatic conditions. Results show that SWE
   decreased strongly with decreasing elevation but was also affected by
   the interannual variability of meteorological drivers. During warmer
   years, the magnitude of changes in SWE was mitigated at higher altitudes
   while exacerbated below 1500m. dynamics indicated that water stress
   conditions for vegetation currently occur at 1000m each year, while only
   a warmer and drier year caused drought at 1500m, and no water stress was
   found at 2000m.ET, B-ag and WUE did not decrease with elevation but
   showed a maximum at an intermediate elevation around 1500m because of
   the contrasting trends of a shorter vegetation season at higher
   elevations and water stress at lower elevations, where, in fact,
   irrigation is needed to maintain grassland productivity. A simulation
   based on long-term climatic conditions in combination with a sensitivity
   analysis of precipitation change showed that this effect is more
   pronounced during drier years, while for the wettest years, ET tended to
   decrease with increasing elevation. Taking these findings together, this
   study suggests that in relatively dry climatic conditions, mountain
   areas generally act as water towers' above 1500m. Quantifying this
   critical threshold and its likely future variation under climate change
   scenarios is a challenge for water resource research in the Alpine
   region and can help stakeholders in planning future mitigation
   strategies. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Plant species richness and endemism on oceanic islands is dependent on
   island age, size, elevation and distance to nearest source of migrants.
   Mainland `island' systems, such as the cool-adapted tropical-alpine
   flora of the mountains in Africa, are less well studied. Here we analyse
   the tropical Afroalpine flora, found on highly isolated mountains
   straddling the equator. Using the beta-sim index in a hierarchical
   clustering approach combined with ordination methods and mantel tests,
   we locate four geographical groups: West Africa, northern East Africa,
   western East Africa and eastern East Africa. We show that these
   groupings are better explained as the consequence of geographical
   isolation rather than environmental filtering. We further show that the
   species richness of the tropical Afroalpine mountain regions-similar to
   oceanic islands-can be explained by a model including age, area size,
   elevation and isolation. Levels of endemism are best explained by
   species richness in combination with area and isolation. Overall we
   develop a comprehensive model of the species richness, endemism and
   composition of the tropical Afroalpine flora.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To provide insights into the assembly and structure of biotic
   communities by exploring several processes of island biodiversity
   assembly: in situ speciation, immigration and ecological processes.
   Location The Mascarene Islands.
   Methods The phylogenetic relationships of 211 out of 232 Mascarene
   leptosporangiate fern species were reconstructed in relation to a global
   phylogeny of 400 leptosporangiate fern species to assess the importance
   of immigration versus in situ speciation and any deviation from
   randomness. Correlations between speciation and habit (terrestrial or
   epiphytic/lithophytic) were tested.
   Results We inferred at least 197 colonization events onto the islands,
   accounting for > 80\% of their leptosporangiate fern diversity. The
   phylogenetic structure of the assemblage of colonists was mostly
   overdispersed but aggregated at the tips of the phylogeny. Several
   families were more diverse on the islands than expected by their global
   richness. Among the 46 endemic species, up to 65\% were inferred to have
   originated by cladogenesis, which in turn was found to be significantly
   related to a terrestrial habit.
   Main conclusions Immigration has played a major role in the assembly of
   the fern flora on the Mascarene Islands. The overdispersion pattern
   supports the hypothesis of a dominant role of competitive interactions
   in the flora assembly, and we propose that most available niches were
   filled by species arriving via long-distance dispersal, preventing
   further immigration of closely related taxa. The over-representation of
   some families may reflect better colonization capacities, preadaptation
   to the Mascarene ecological niches, or ecological differentiation.
   Frequent colonization by long-distance dispersal has probably hampered
   in situ speciation in some habitats such as the epiphytic realm.
   Conversely, cladogenetic speciation appears to occur more frequently in
   terrestrial habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrothermal synthesis has been used as a soft chemical method to
   prepare bismuth molybdate catalysts for the selective oxidation of
   propylene to acrolein. All obtained samples displayed a plate-like
   morphology, but their individual aspect ratios varied with the
   hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Application of a high Bi/Mo ratio
   during hydrothermal synthesis afforded gamma-Bi2MoO6 as the main phase,
   whereas lower initial bismuth contents promoted the formation of
   alpha-Bi2Mo3O12. Synthesis with a Bi/Mo ratio of 1:1 led to a phase
   mixture of alpha- and gamma-bismuth molybdate showing high catalytic
   activity. The use of nitric acid during hydrothermal synthesis enhanced
   both propylene conversion and acrolein yield, possibly due to a change
   in morphology. Formation of beta-Bi2Mo2O9 was not observed under the
   applied conditions. In general, the catalytic performance of all samples
   decreased notably after calcination at 550 degrees C due to sintering.

Title = {{Anthropogenic-based regional-scale factors most consistently explain

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{802-810}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Aim Evidence linking the accumulation of exotic species to the
   suppression of native diversity is equivocal, often relying on data from
   studies that have used different methods. Plot-level studies often
   attribute inverse relationships between native and exotic diversity to
   competition, but regional abiotic filters, including anthropogenic
   influences, can produce similar patterns. We seek to test these
   alternatives using identical scale-dependent sampling protocols in
   multiple grasslands on two continents. Location Thirty-two grassland
   sites in North America and Australia. Methods We use multiscale
   observational data, collected identically in grain and extent at each
   site, to test the association of local and regional factors with the
   plot-level richness and abundance of native and exotic plants. Sites
   captured environmental and anthropogenic gradients including land-use
   intensity, human population density, light and soil resources, climate
   and elevation. Site selection occurred independently of exotic
   diversity, meaning that the numbers of exotic species varied randomly
   thereby reducing potential biases if only highly invaded sites were
   chosen. Results Regional factors associated directly or indirectly with
   human activity had the strongest associations with plot-level diversity.
   These regional drivers had divergent effects: urban-based economic
   activity was associated with high exotic:native diversity ratios;
   climate- and landscape-based indicators of lower human population
   density were associated with low exotic:native ratios. Negative
   correlations between plot-level native and exotic diversity, a potential
   signature of competitive interactions, were not prevalent; this result
   did not change along gradients of productivity or heterogeneity. Main
   conclusion We show that plot-level diversity of native and exotic plants
   are more consistently associated with regional-scale factors relating to
   urbanization and climate suitability than measures indicative of
   competition. These findings clarify the long-standing difficulty in
   resolving drivers of exotic diversity using single-factor mechanisms,
   suggesting that multiple interacting anthropogenic-based processes best
   explain the accumulation of exotic diversity in modern landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{We estimate the effects of climatic changes, as predicted by six climate
   models, on lake surface temperatures on a global scale, using the lake
   surface equilibrium temperature as a proxy. We evaluate interactions
   between different forcing variables, the sensitivity of lake surface
   temperatures to these variables, as well as differences between climate
   zones. Lake surface equilibrium temperatures are predicted to increase
   by 70 to 85 \% of the increase in air temperatures. On average, air
   temperature is the main driver for changes in lake surface temperatures,
   and its effect is reduced by similar to 10 \% by changes in other
   meteorological variables. However, the contribution of these other
   variables to the variance is similar to 40 \% of that of air
   temperature, and their effects can be important at specific locations.
   The warming increases the importance of longwave radiation and
   evaporation for the lake surface heat balance compared to shortwave
   radiation and convective heat fluxes. We discuss the consequences of our
   findings for the design and evaluation of different types of studies on
   climate change effects on lakes.}},

Abstract = {{Farmland species provide key ecological services that support
   agricultural production, but are under threat from agricultural
   intensification and mechanization. In order to design effective measures
   to mitigate agricultural impact, simultaneous investigations of
   different taxonomic groups across several regions are required.
   Therefore, four contrasting taxonomic groups were investigated: plants,
   earthworms, spiders and bees (wild bees and bumblebees), which represent
   different trophic levels and provide different ecological services. To
   better understand underlying patterns, three community measurements for
   each taxonomic group were considered: abundance, species richness and
   species composition. In four European regions, ten potential
   environmental drivers of the four taxonomic groups were tested and
   assigned to three groups of drivers: geographic location (farm, region),
   agricultural management (crop type, mineral nitrogen input, organic
   nitrogen input, mechanical field operations and pesticide applications)
   and surrounding landscape in a 250 m buffer zone (diversity of habitats
   in the surroundings, proportion of arable fields and proportion of
   non-productive, non-woody habitats). First, the variation in abundance,
   species richness and species composition from 167 arable sites was
   partitioned to compare the relative contribution of the three groups of
   drivers (geographic location, agricultural management and surrounding
   landscape). Second, generalized linear mixed-effects models were applied
   to estimate the effect of the individual explanatory variables on
   abundance and species richness. Our analysis showed a dominant effect of
   geographic location in all four taxonomic groups and a strong influence
   of agricultural management on plants, spiders and bees. The effect of
   the surrounding landscape was of minor importance and inconsistent in
   our data. We conclude that in European arable fields, the avoidance of
   mineral nitrogen and pesticides is beneficial for biodiversity, and that
   species protection measures should take into account regional
   characteristics and the community structure of the investigated
   taxonomic groups. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Leptospirosis is an important occupational disease in New Zealand. The
   objectives of this study were to determine risk factors for
   sero-prevalence of leptospiral antibodies in abattoir workers. Sera were
   collected from 567 abattoir workers and tested by microscopic
   agglutination for Leptospira interrogans sv. Pomona and Leptospira
   borgpetersenii sv. Hardjobovis. Association between prevalence and risk
   factors were determined by species specific multivariable analysis.
   Eleven percent of workers had antibodies against Hardjobovis or/and
   Pomona. Workers from the four sheep abattoirs had an average
   sero-prevalence of 10\%-31\%, from the two deer abattoirs 17\%-19\% and
   the two beef abattoirs 5\%. The strongest risk factor for
   sero-positivity in sheep and deer abattoirs was work position. In sheep
   abattoirs, prevalence was highest at stunning and hide removal, followed
   by removal of the bladder and kidneys. Wearing personal protective
   equipment such as gloves and facemasks did not appear to protect against
   infection. Home slaughtering, farming or hunting were not significantly
   associated with sero-prevalence. There is substantial risk of exposure
   to leptospires in sheep and deer abattoirs in New Zealand and a
   persisting, but lower risk, in beef abattoirs. Interventions, such as
   animal vaccination, appear necessary to control leptospirosis as an
   occupational disease in New Zealand.}},

Abstract = {{Mapping changes in glacier extent from repeat optical satellite data has
   revealed widespread glacier decline in nearly all regions of the world
   over the past few decades. While numerous studies have documented the
   changes of the outlet glaciers of the Northern and Southern Patagonia
   Icefields (NPI/SPI), information about glacier changes in the Patagonian
   Andes (to the north of the NPI) is much scarcer. Here we present an
   assessment of area changes for glaciers mainly located in the Palena
   district of Chile based on glacier inventories for 1985, 2000 and 2011
   that were derived from two consecutive Landsat scenes and a digital
   elevation model. The analysis revealed a dramatic area decline for the
   largest glaciers and total area loss of 25\% from 1985 to 2011. The
   lower parts of several larger glaciers (>10 km(2)) melted completely.
   Area loss below 1000 m elevation was 50-100\% in both periods, and 374
   glaciers out of 1664 disappeared. The number of proglacial lakes
   increased from 223 to 327 and their area expanded by 11.6 km(2) (59\%)
   between 1985 and 2011. Seasonal snow persisting at high elevations in
   the 2011 scene was a major obstacle to glacier delineation, so the
   obtained area change rate of similar to 1\% a(-1) over the entire period
   is a lower-bound estimate. The observed climate trends (e.g. cooling in
   Puerto Montt) are in contrast to the observed shrinkage.}},

Abstract = {{1. With ever-increasing human pressure on ecosystems, it is critically
   important to predict how ecosystem functions will respond to such
   human-induced perturbations. We define perturbations as either changes
   to abiotic environment (e.g. eutrophication, climate change) that
   indirectly affects biota, or direct changes to biota (e.g. species
   introductions). While two lines of research in ecology,
   biodiversity-ecosystem function (BDEF) and ecological resilience (ER)
   research, have addressed this issue, both fields of research have
   nontrivial shortcomings in their abilities to address a wide range of
   realistic scenarios.
   2. We outline how an integrated research framework may foster a deeper
   understanding of the functional consequences of perturbations via
   simultaneous application of (i) process-based mechanistic predictions
   using trait-based approaches and (ii) detection of empirical patterns of
   functional changes along real perturbation gradients. In this context,
   the complexities of ecological interactions and evolutionary
   perspectives should be integrated into future research.
   3. Synthesis and applications. Management of human-impacted ecosystems
   can be guided most directly by understanding the response of ecosystem
   functions to controllable perturbations. In particular, we need to
   characterize the form of a wide range of perturbation-function
   relationships and to draw connections between those patterns and the
   underlying ecological processes. We anticipate that the integrated
   perspectives will also be helpful for managers to derive practical
   implications for management from academic literature.}},

Abstract = {{The European water frog Pelophylax esculentus is a natural hybrid
   between P. lessonae (genotype LL) and P. ridibundus (RR). It reproduces
   through hybridogenesis, eliminating one parental genome from its
   germline and producing gametes containing the genome of the other
   parental species. According to previous studies, this elimination and
   transmission pattern is very diverse. In mixed populations, where only
   diploid hybrids (LR) live in sympatry and mate with one or both parental
   species, the excluded genome varies among regions, and the remaining
   genome is transmitted clonally to haploid gametes. In all-hybrid
   populations consisting of diploid (LR) and triploid (LLR and/or LRR)
   frogs, diploid individuals also produce gametes clonally (1n in males,
   2n in females), whereas triploids eliminate the genome they have in
   single copy and produce haploid gametes containing the recombined other
   genome. However, here, too, regional differences seem to exist, and some
   triploids have been reported to produce diploid gametes. In order to
   systematically study such regional and genotype differences in gamete
   production, their potential origin, and their consequences for the
   breeding system, we sampled frogs from five populations in three
   European countries, performed crossing experiments, and investigated the
   genetic variation through microsatellite analysis. For four populations,
   one in Poland, two in Germany, and one in Slovakia, our results
   confirmed the elimination and transmission pattern described above. In
   one Slovakian population, however, we found a totally different pattern.
   Here, triploid males (LLR) produce sperm with a clonally transmitted
   diploid LL genome, rather than a haploid recombined L genome, and LR
   females clonally produce haploid R eggs, rather than diploid LR eggs.
   These differences among the populations in gamete production go along
   with differences in genomotype composition, breeding system (i.e., the
   way triploids are produced), and genetic variation. These differences
   are strong evidence for a polyphyletic origin of triploids. Moreover,
   our findings shed light on the evolutionary potential inherent to the P.
   esculentus complex, where rare events due to untypical gametogenetic
   processes can lead to the raise, the perpetuation, and the dispersion of
   new evolutionary significant lineages which may also deserve special
   conservation measures.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, rapid topographic changes and increased erosion rates
   caused by massive slope failures in a glacierized and
   permafrost-affected high-mountain face were investigated with respect to
   the current climatic change. The study was conducted at one of the
   highest periglacial rock faces in the European Alps, the east face of
   Monte Rosa, Italy. Pronounced changes in ice cover and repeated rock and
   ice avalanche events have been documented in this rock wall since around
   1990. The performed multi-temporal comparison of high-resolution digital
   terrain models (DTMs) complemented by detailed analyses of repeat
   photography represents a unique assessment of topographic changes and
   slope failures over half a century and reveals a total volume loss in
   bedrock and steep glaciers in the central part of the face of around
   25x106 m3 between 1988 and 2007. The high rock and ice avalanche
   activity translates into an increase in erosion rates of about one order
   of magnitude during recent decades. The study indicates that changes in
   atmospheric temperatures and connected changes in ice cover can induce
   slope destabilization in high-mountain faces. Analyses of temperature
   data show that the start of the intense mass movement activity coincided
   with increased mean annual temperatures in the region around 1990.
   However, once triggered, mass movement activity seems to be able to
   proceed in a self-reinforcing cycle, whereby single mass movement events
   might be strongly influenced by short-term extreme temperature events.
   The investigations suggest a strong stability coupling between steep
   glaciers and underlying bedrock, as most bedrock instabilities are
   located in areas where surface ice has disappeared recently and the
   failure zones are frequently spatially correlated and often develop from
   lower altitudes progressively upwards. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Glacier highstands since the Last Glacial Maximum are well documented
   for many regions, but little is known about glacier fluctuations and
   lowstands during the Holocene. This is because the traces of minimum
   extents are difficult to identify and at many places are still ice
   covered, limiting the access to sample material. Here we report a new
   approach to assess minimal glacier extent, using a 72-m long
   surface-to-bedrock ice core drilled on Khukh Nuru Uul, a glacier in the
   Tsambagarav mountain range of the Mongolian Altai (4130 m asl, 48
   degrees 39.338'N, 90 degrees 50.826'E). The small ice cap has low ice
   temperatures and flat bedrock topography at the drill site. This
   indicates minimal lateral glacier flow and thereby preserved climate
   signals. The upper two-thirds of the ice core contain 200 years of
   climate information with annual resolution, whereas the lower third is
   subject to strong thinning of the annual layers with a basal ice age of
   approximately 6000 years before present (BP). We interpret the basal ice
   age as indicative of ice-free conditions in the Tsambagarav mountain
   range at 4100 m asl prior to 6000 years BP. This age marks the onset of
   the Neoglaciation and the end of the Holocene Climate Optimum. The
   ice-free conditions allow for adjusting the Equilibrium Line Altitude
   (ELA) and derive the glacier extent in the Mongolian Altai during the
   Holocene Climate Optimum. Based on the ELA-shift, we conclude that most
   of the glaciers are not remnants of the Last Glacial Maximum but were
   formed during the second part of the Holocene. The ice core derived
   accumulation reconstruction suggests important changes in the
   precipitation pattern over the last 6000 years. During formation of the
   glacier, more humid conditions than presently prevailed followed by a
   long dry period from 5000 years BP until 250 years ago. Present
   conditions are more humid than during the past millennia. This is
   consistent with precipitation evolution derived from lake sediment
   studies in the Altai. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Advances in the floral structural characterization of the major
   subclades of Malpighiales, one of the largest orders of flowering plants}},

Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{Malpighiales are one of the largest angiosperm orders and have undergone
   radical systematic restructuring based on molecular phylogenetic
   studies. The clade has been recalcitrant to molecular phylogenetic
   reconstruction, but has become much more resolved at the suprafamilial
   level. It now contains so many newly identified clades that there is an
   urgent need for comparative studies to understand their structure,
   biology and evolution. This is especially true because the order
   contains a disproportionally large diversity of rain forest species and
   includes numerous agriculturally important plants. This study is a first
   broad systematic step in this endeavour. It focuses on a comparative
   structural overview of the flowers across all recently identified
   suprafamilial clades of Malpighiales, and points towards areas that
   desperately need attention.
   The phylogenetic comparative analysis of floral structure for the order
   is based on our previously published studies on four suprafamilial
   clades of Malpighiales, including also four related rosid orders
   (Celastrales, Crossosomatales, Cucurbitales, Oxalidales). In addition,
   the results are compiled from a survey of over 3000 publications on
   macrosystematics, floral structure and embryology across all orders of
   the core eudicots.
   Most new suprafamilial clades within Malpighiales are well supported by
   floral structural features. Inner morphological structures of the
   gynoecium (i.e. stigmatic lobes, inner shape of the locules,
   placentation, presence of obturators) and ovules (i.e. structure of the
   nucellus, thickness of the integuments, presence of vascular bundles in
   the integuments, presence of an endothelium in the inner integument)
   appear to be especially suitable for characterizing suprafamilial clades
   within Malpighiales.
   Although the current phylogenetic reconstruction of Malpighiales is much
   improved compared with earlier versions, it is incomplete, and further
   focused phylogenetic and morphological studies are needed. Once all
   major subclades of Malpighiales are elucidated, more in-depth studies on
   promising structural features can be conducted. In addition, once the
   phylogenetic tree of Malpighiales, including closely related orders, is
   more fully resolved, character optimization studies will be possible to
   reconstruct evolution of structural and biological features within the
   order.}},

Abstract = {{The middle Cambrian Hanneh Member of the Bud Formation and the middle to
   upper Cambrian Umm Ishrin Formation of the Dead Sea area, Jordan,
   contain well-preserved and abundant ichnofaunas. Trace fossils are
   present in a wide variety of depositional environments, from
   tide-dominated shelf to prodelta, delta front and interdistributary-bay
   tidal flats. Twelve `trace fossil assemblages have been identified
   within a number of sequence-stratigraphic settings, namely early
   transgressive subtidal dune and bar complex, late transgressive isolated
   dune patches and dune-field abandonment highstand deltaic progradation,
   and forced-regressive deltaic progradation. These ichnofaunas provide
   information that helps us to understand the nature of Cambrian
   ecosystems in the aftermath of the Cambrian radiation. The Jordan
   ichnofaunas display evidence of firm ground conditions at or near the
   sea bottom. These include (1) well-preserved scratch marks in most
   Cruziana and Rusophycus ichnospecies, (2) adhering Gyrolithes polonicus
   burrows, and (3) unlined passively filled Diplocraterion isp.
   penetrating into underlying mudstone. Whereas the Diplocraterion isp.
   occurrences are a classic example of the Glossifungites ichnofacies
   linked to erosional exhumation, the firmground G. polonicus is
   associated to a maximum flooding surface with no erosion involved. The
   trace fossil suites dominated by trilobite structures are firmground
   examples of the Cruziana ichnofacies, raising issues with respect to the
   substrate affinities of this ichnofacies, which is typically considered
   indicative of softgrounds. Our study underscores evolutionary controls
   on this ichnofacies, suggesting that lower Paleozoic occurrences, which
   are dominated by trilobite trails and trackways, reflect firm substrates
   and younger ones represent the typical softground examples. The
   occurrence of abundant bilobate trace fossils, scratch marks and
   trackways in interdistributary-bay tidal flats within a braidplain delta
   complex in the Umm Ishrin Formation provides evidence that arthropods
   were able to foray into marginal-marine brackish-water settings during
   the Cambrian. Analysis of the tiering structure indicates relatively
   simple communities and limited use of the infaunal ecospace. Low-energy
   fully marine and marginal-marine ichnofabrics are dominated by
   shallow-tier deposit- and detritus-feeding trace fossils. Deep-tier
   structures of detritus feeders are present in ichnofabrics from fully
   marine low-energy settings, whereas deep-tier trace fossils of
   suspension feeders are dominant in high-energy subtidal zones. (C) 2012

Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{37-44}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Private gardens can incorporate a diversity of habitats for wild species
   and also provide a valuable network for meta-populations. Recently,
   attempts have been made to promote garden practices that increase native
   biodiversity and structural heterogeneity relevant to plants and
   animals. However, little is known about whether such practices
   contribute to the aesthetic quality of gardens. This study was based on
   a survey of 36 garden owners in Switzerland, a species count in their
   gardens, and a photo-questionnaire with 249 Swiss residents who rated
   the attractiveness of the gardens. The gardens included a gradient from
   conventional orthodox (frequent lawn mowing and weeding, intensive use
   of pesticides and fertilizers) to ecological unorthodox (infrequent lawn
   mowing and weeding, no use of pesticides and fertilizers) gardening
   practices. Our results clearly show that scientific concepts of
   ecological quality can align with cultural concepts of aesthetic
   quality. The more ecologically managed a garden, the more species it
   contained. The more species the garden contained, the more attractive it
   was to the sample population. Aesthetically pleasing gardens were
   characterized by the public as natural and species-rich, whereas
   aesthetically displeasing gardens were characterized as boring, normal,
   and species-poor. Ecological gardening was not considered to be more
   time consuming than conventional gardening. A lack of practical know-how
   was a greater constraint. Respondents were tolerant towards ecological
   gardening, but would not want their garden to be considered as chaotic.

Pages = {{296-302}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{According to theory, drift load in randomly mating populations is
   determined by past population size, because enhanced genetic drift in
   small populations causes accumulation and fixation of recessive
   deleterious mutations of small effect. In contrast, segregating load due
   to mutations of low frequency should decline in smaller populations, at
   least when mutations are highly recessive and strongly deleterious.
   Strong local selection generally reduces both types of load. We tested
   these predictions in 13 isolated, outcrossing populations of Arabidopsis
   lyrata that varied in population size and plant density. Long-term size
   was estimated by expected heterozygosity at 20 microsatellite loci.
   Segregating load was assessed by comparing performance of offspring from
   selfings versus within-population crosses. Drift load was the heterosis
   effect created by interpopulation outbreeding. Results showed that
   segregating load was unrelated to long-term size. However, drift load
   was significantly higher in populations of small effective size and low
   density. Drift load was mostly expressed late in development, but
   started as early as germination and accumulated thereafter. The study
   largely confirms predictions of theory and illustrates that mutation
   accumulation can be a threat to natural populations. Heredity (2013)

Journal = {{NATURE ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fungi have recently been found to comprise a significant part of the
   deep biosphere in oceanic sediments and crustal rocks. Fossils occupying
   fractures and pores in Phanerozoic volcanics indicate that this habitat
   is at least 400 million years old, but its origin may be considerably
   older. A 2.4-billion-year-old basalt from the Palaeoproterozoic Ongeluk
   Formation in South Africa contains filamentous fossils in vesicles and
   fractures. The filaments form mycelium-like structures growing from a
   basal film attached to the internal rock surfaces. Filaments branch and
   anastomose, touch and entangle each other. They are indistinguishable
   from mycelial fossils found in similar deep-biosphere habitats in the
   Phanerozoic, where they are attributed to fungi on the basis of chemical
   and morphological similarities to living fungi. The Ongeluk fossils,
   however, are two to three times older than current age estimates of the
   fungal clade. Unless they represent an unknown branch of fungus-like
   organisms, the fossils imply that the fungal clade is considerably older
   than previously thought, and that fungal origin and early evolution may
   lie in the oceanic deep biosphere rather than on land. The Ongeluk
   discovery suggests that life has inhabited submarine volcanics for more
   than 2.4 billion years.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1686-1699}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Sexual selection theory predicts a trade-off between premating
   (ornaments and armaments) and postmating (testes and ejaculates) sexual
   traits, assuming that growing and maintaining these traits is costly and
   that total reproductive investments are limited. The number of males in
   competition, the reproductive gains from investing in premating sexual
   traits, and the level of sperm competition are all predicted to
   influence how males allocate their finite resources to these traits.
   Yet, empirical examination of these predictions is currently scarce.
   Here, we studied relative expenditure on pre- and postmating sexual
   traits among frog species varying in their population density,
   operational sex ratio, and the number of competing males for each clutch
   of eggs. We found that the intensifying struggle to monopolize
   fertilizations as more and more males clasp the same female to fertilize
   her eggs shifts male reproductive investment toward sperm production and
   away from male weaponry. This shift, which is mediated by population
   density and the associated level of male-male competition, likely also
   explains the trade-off between pre- and postmating sexual traits in our
   much broader sample of anuran species. Our results highlight the power
   of such a multilevel approach in resolving the evolution of traits and
   allocation trade-offs.}},

Abstract = {{The need for an environmental risk assessment for engineered
   nanomaterials (ENM) necessitates the knowledge about their environmental
   emissions. Material flow models (MFA) have been used to provide
   predicted environmental emissions but most current nano-MFA models
   consider neither the rapid development of ENM production nor the fact
   that a large proportion of ENM are entering an in use stock and are
   released from products over time (i.e., have a lag phase). Here we use
   dynamic probabilistic material flow modeling to predict scenarios of the
   future flows of four ENM (nano-TiO2, nano-ZnO, nano-Ag and CNT) to
   environmental compartments and to quantify their amounts in (temporary)
   sinks such as the in-use stock and ({''}final{''}) environmental sinks
   such as soil and sediment. In these scenarios, we estimate likely future
   amounts if the use and distribution of ENM in products continues along
   current trends (i.e., a business-as-usual approach) and predict the
   effect of hypothetical trends in the market development of
   nanomaterials, such as the emergence of a new widely used product or the
   ban on certain substances, on the flows of nanomaterials to the
   environment in years to come. We show that depending on the scenario and
   the product type affected, significant changes of the flows occur over
   time, driven by the growth of stocks and delayed release dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Casparian strips are precisely localized and aligned ring-like cell wall
   modifications in the root of all higher plants. They set up an
   extracellular diffusion barrier analogous to animal tight junctions, and
   are crucial for maintaining the homeostatic capacity of plant roots.
   Casparian strips become localized because of the formation of a highly
   stable plasma membrane domain, consisting of a family of small
   transmembrane proteins called Casparian strip membrane domain proteins
   (CASPs). Here we report a large-scale forward genetic screen directly
   visualizing endodermal barrier function, which allowed us to identify
   factors required for the formation and integrity of Casparian strips. We
   present the identification and characterization of one of the mutants,
   schengen1 (sgn1), a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase that we show
   localizes in a strictly polar fashion to the outer plasma membrane of
   endodermal cells and is required for the positioning and correct
   formation of the centrally located CASP domain.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the link between area increase of Imja Tsho (Lake)
   and changes of Imja Glacier (area similar to 25 km(2)) under the
   influence of climate change using multitemporal satellite imagery and
   local climate data. Between 1962 and 2013, Imja Lake expanded from 0.03
   +/- 0.01 to 1.35 +/- 0.05 km(2) at a rate of 0.026 +/- 0.001 km(2)
   a(-1). The mean glacier-wide flow velocity was 37 +/- 30 m a(-1) during
   1992-93 and 23 +/- 15 m a(-1) during 2013-14, indicating a decreasing
   velocity. A mean elevation change of -1.29 +/- 0.71 m a(-1) was observed
   over the lower part of the glacier in the period 2001-14, with a rate of
   -1.06 +/- 0.63 m a(-1) in 2001-08 and -1.56 +/- 0.80 m a(-1) in 2008-14.
   We conclude that the decrease in flow velocity is mainly associated with
   reduced accumulation due to a decrease in precipitation during the last
   few decades. Furthermore, glacier ablation has increased due to
   increasing maximum temperatures during the post-monsoon months.
   Decreased glacier flow velocities and increased mass losses induce the
   formation and subsequent expansion of glacial lakes under favourable
   topographic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Many parasites circulate endemically within communities of multiple host
   species. To understand disease persistence within these communities, it
   is essential to know the contribution each host species makes to
   parasite transmission and maintenance. However, quantifying those
   contributions is challenging. We present a conceptual framework for
   classifying multihost sharing, based on key thresholds for parasite
   persistence. We then develop a generalized technique to quantify each
   species' contribution to parasite persistence, allowing natural systems
   to be located within the framework. We illustrate this approach using
   data on gastrointestinal parasites circulating within rodent communities
   and show that, although many parasites infect several host species,
   parasite persistence is often driven by just one host species. In some
   cases, however, parasites require multiple host species for maintenance.
   Our approach provides a quantitative method for differentiating these
   cases using minimal reliance on system-specific parameters, enabling
   informed decisions about parasite management within poorly understood
   multihost communities.}},

Title = {{New insights into redox control of starch degradation}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Starch is one of the major sinks of fixed carbon in photosynthetic
   tissues of higher plants. Carbon fixation and the synthesis of primary
   starch occur during the day in the chloroplast stroma, whereas starch
   degradation typically occurs during the following night to fuel the
   whole plant with energy and carbon in the absence of photosynthesis.
   Redox-based regulatory systems play a central role in the modulation of
   several chloroplastic pathways. Reversible oxidations of cysteine
   residues are post-translational modifications that orchestrate the
   precise functioning of chloroplast pathways together with changes in pH,
   Mg2+ and concentrations of metabolic intermediates. Leaf starch
   metabolism has been intensively studied. The enzymes involved in starch
   synthesis and degradation have been identified and characterized.
   However, the redox control of the enzymes responsible for starch
   degradation at night remains elusive, and their response to redox
   transitions conflicts with the timing of the physiological events. Most
   of the enzymes of starch degradation are activated by reducing
   conditions, characteristic of daytime. Thus, redox control may have only
   a minor role during starch degradation at night, but could become
   relevant for daily stomatal opening in guard cells or in the
   re-allocation of fixed carbon in mesophyll cells in response to stress
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Discharge from marine-terminating outlet glaciers accounts for up to
   half the recent mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet, yet the causal
   factors are not fully understood. Here we assess the factors controlling
   the behaviour of Humboldt Glacier (HG), allowing us to evaluate the
   influence of basal topography on outlet glacier response to external
   forcing since part of HG's terminus occupies a large overdeepening. HG's
   retreat accelerated dramatically after 1999, coinciding with summer
   atmospheric warming of up to 0.19 degrees C a(-1) and sea-ice decline.
   Retreat was an order of magnitude greater in the northern section of the
   terminus, underlain by a major basal trough, than in the southern
   section, where the bedrock is comparatively shallow. Velocity change
   following retreat was spatially non-uniform, potentially due to a
   pinning point near HG's northern lateral margin. Consistent with
   observations, numerical modelling demonstrates an order-of-magnitude
   greater sensitivity to sea-ice buttressing and crevasse depth (used as a
   proxy for atmospheric warming) in the northern section. The trough
   extends up to 72 km inland, so it is likely to facilitate sustained
   retreat and ice loss from HG during the 21st century.}},

Abstract = {{Resources and cues provided by the mother before birth are important
   mediators of developmental plasticity. It has been suggested that the
   adaptive value of such prenatal maternal effects may depend on the
   environment encountered by the offspring after birth, and that offspring
   may perform better when environmental conditions encountered by the
   mother and the offspring match, than when a mismatch occurs. Here, we
   test how prenatal maternal effects and postnatal conditions interact in
   influencing offspring growth and development in wild-living great tits
   (Parus major) by manipulating food availability experienced by the
   mother before egg laying, partially cross-fostering nestlings between
   nests, and manipulating food availability after hatching. We observed
   significant interaction effects between pre- and postnatal food
   conditions. Nonsupplemented nestlings reached a similar fledging mass, a
   trait closely linked to postfledging survival, as food-supplemented
   nestlings when their biological mother had received extra food during
   egg laying. It shows that prenatal maternal investment can compensate
   for growth-limiting conditions after hatching. This effect was sex
   specific, with daughters benefiting more than sons. Furthermore,
   food-supplemented nestlings grew largest when their biological mother
   had not received extra food during egg laying, suggesting that offspring
   were primed prenatally, possibly through differential egg composition,
   to use resources more efficiently. However, we found no evidence that
   offspring performed generally better when pre- and postnatal food
   conditions matched than when a mismatch occurred. Our results
   demonstrate the importance of considering the postnatal environment when
   testing for the ecological and evolutionary consequences of prenatal
   maternal effects in natural populations.Resources transferred by the
   bird mother via the egg help to reduce the negative consequences of a
   harsh environment after birth. Furthermore, mothers encountering harsh
   environmental conditions during egg laying prime their offspring to use
   available resources more efficiently later in life. Our study shows that
   the environment encountered before birth can have important long-term
   consequences on offspring performance and the way animals interact with
   their environment.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Our aim was to seek explanations for the differences in the
   diversity among the austral continents by comparing the diversification
   rates and patterns in the grass subfamily Danthonioideae. We asked
   specifically whether diversification is density dependent, whether it is
   different for each continent, and whether immigration rates impact on
   diversification rates. We attempted to account for intercontinental
   differences by comparing the Pleistocene climatic and Neogene
   geomorphological histories with the inferred diversification rates.
   Location Mainly the Southern Hemisphere, treated as four areas for the
   analyses: Africa, Australia, New Zealand and South America. Methods We
   based our analyses on a densely sampled, dated phylogeny for the grass
   subfamily Danthonioideae. We compared 24 diversification models for
   these continental radiations, taking into account speciation models, and
   extinction and dispersal rates. We used available distribution data to
   infer the climates under which danthonioids are found, and used these to
   estimate the change in area and location of suitable habitats between
   contemporary and Last Glacial Maximum climates. We inferred the
   geomorphological history from the literature. Results We show that
   long-distance dispersal led to parallel radiations, which more than
   doubled the final standing diversity in the subfamily. Diversification
   models with the strongest support included separate time-varying
   diversification processes for each major geographical region.
   Pleistocene climatic fluctuation did not explain the intercontinental
   differences in diversification patterns. Main conclusions Although our
   results are consistent with density-dependent diversification, this
   explanation is not consistent with the time of arrival of danthonioids
   on each continent. The diversification patterns on the four major
   Southern Hemisphere landmasses are idiosyncratic. The two most important
   predictors of diversity may be the lineage-specific effect of time, and
   the general effect of topographical complexity and orogenesis.}},

Volume = {{164}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The fern genus Tectaria has generally been placed in the family
   Tectariaceae or in subfamily Tectarioideae (placed in Dennstaedtiaceae,
   Dryopteridaceae or Polypodiaceae), both of which have been variously
   circumscribed in the past. Here we study for the first time the
   phylogenetic relationships of the associated genera Hypoderris (endemic
   to the Caribbean), Cionidium (endemic to New Caledonia) and
   Pseudotectaria (endemic to Madagascar and Comoros) using DNA sequence
   data. Based on a broad sampling of 72 species of eupolypods I (=
   Polypodiaceae sensu lato) and three plastid DNA regions (atpA, rbcL and
   the trnL-F intergenic spacer) we were able to place the three previously
   unsampled genera. Our results show that Cionidium, like Ctenitopsis,
   Fadyenia, Hemigramma and Quercifilix, is embedded in Tectaria, and the
   monophyly of Tectaria is therefore corroborated only if these segregate
   genera are included. Hypoderris is sister to Tectaria brauniana and
   together they are sister to Triplophyllum, which was found to be
   monophyletic. Despite their morphological similarity with Tectaria, the
   genera Pleocnemia and Pseudotectaria were placed in Dryopteridoideae.
   Polypodiaceae subfamily Tectarioideae (former family Tectariaceae) is
   hereby defined to include Arthropteris, Hypoderris, Pteridrys, Tectaria
   and Triplophyllum. Aenigmopteris may also belong here, but this genus
   remains unsampled.}},

Abstract = {{Vitis vinifera L. represents an economically important fruit species.
   Grape and wine flavour is made from a complex set of compounds. The
   acidity of berries is a major parameter in determining grape berry
   quality for wine making and fruit consumption. Despite the importance of
   malic and tartaric acid (TA) storage and transport for grape berry
   acidity, no vacuolar transporter for malate or tartrate has been
   identified so far. Some members of the aluminium-activated malate
   transporter (ALMT) anion channel family from Arabidopsis thaliana have
   been shown to be involved in mediating malate fluxes across the
   tonoplast. Therefore, we hypothesised that a homologue of these channels
   could have a similar role in V. vinifera grape berries. We identified
   homologues of the Arabidopsis vacuolar anion channel AtALMT9 through a
   TBLASTX search on the V. vinifera genome database. We cloned the closest
   homologue of AtALMT9 from grape berry cDNA and designated it VvALMT9.
   The expression profile revealed that VvALMT9 is constitutively expressed
   in berry mesocarp tissue and that its transcription level increases
   during fruit maturation. Moreover, we found that VvALMT9 is targeted to
   the vacuolar membrane. Using patch-clamp analysis, we could show that,
   besides malate, VvALMT9 mediates tartrate currents which are higher than
   in its Arabidopsis homologue. In summary, in the present study we
   provide evidence that VvALMT9 is a vacuolar malate channel expressed in
   grape berries. Interestingly, in V. vinifera, a tartrate-producing
   plant, the permeability of the channel is apparently adjusted to TA.}},

   of four watersheds in the Blue Nile Basin using a model-based method for
   hydrological change detection. The four watersheds, Birr, Upper-Didesa,
   Gilgel Abbay, and Koga range in size from 260 to 1800 km(2). The changes
   were assessed based on model parameters, model residuals, and in the
   overall function of the watersheds in transferring rainfall into runoff.
   The entire time series (1960-2004) was divided into three periods based
   on political and land management policy changes. A conceptual
   rainfall-runoff model, the HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans
   Vattenbalansavdelning) model, was used for the analysis, and suitable
   parameter sets for each period were found based on a Monte Carlo
   approach. The values of six out of nine parameters changed significantly
   between the periods. Model residuals also showed significant changes
   between the three periods in three of the four watersheds. On the other
   hand, the overall functioning of the watersheds in processing rainfall
   to runoff changed little. So even though the individual parameters and
   model residuals were changing, the integrated functioning of the
   watersheds showed minimal changes. This study demonstrated the value of
   using different approaches for detecting hydrological change and
   highlighted the sensitivity of the outcome to the applied modeling and
   statistical methods.}},

Abstract = {{In environmental psychology, many researchers have apparently placed
   appreciation of nature and appreciation of environmental protection in
   the same attitudinal category. In this article, the authors argue that
   this involves a misconception. The authors used survey data from 1,336
   Swiss adults to compare competing attitudinal models: the currently
   accepted one-dimensional model against a two-dimensional model that
   distinguishes appreciation of nature from appreciation of environmental
   protection. A Rasch-type measurement model was implemented to test the
   theoretically anticipated item-factor structure. The model that treated
   appreciation of nature and appreciation of environmental protection as
   distinct attitudes was statistically superior to the one-dimensional
   model. The gains in reliability and model accuracy were modest, but the
   authors see substantial theoretical and practical value in treating
   appreciation of nature and appreciation of environmental protection as
   separate attitudes. For example, if the intention is to promote more
   environmental engagement, then appreciation of nature might be the more
   malleable target and thus the critical factor for change.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing atmospheric warming causes rapid shrinking of glaciers in the
   European Alps, with a high chance of their near-complete disappearance
   by the end of the 21st century. Here we present a comparison of three
   independent approaches to model the possible evolution of the glaciers
   in the Swiss Alps over the 21st century. The models have different
   levels of complexity, work at a regional scale and are forced with three
   scenarios of temperature increase (low, moderate, high). The moderate
   climate scenario gives an increase in air temperature of similar to 2
   degrees C and similar to 4 degrees C for the two scenario periods
   2021-50 and 2070-99, respectively, resulting in an area loss of 60-80\%
   by 2100. In reality, the shrinkage could be even faster, as the observed
   mean annual thickness loss is already stronger than the modelled one.
   The three approaches lead to rather similar results with respect to the
   overall long-term evolution. The choice of climate scenarios produces
   the largest spread (similar to 40\%) in the final area loss, while the
   uncertainty in present-day ice-thickness estimation causes about half
   this spread.}},

Abstract = {{A 454 sequencing snapshot was utilised to investigate the genome
   composition and nucleotide diversity of transposable elements (TEs) for
   several Triticeae taxa, including Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare,
   Hordeum spontaneum and Secale cereale together with relatives of the A,
   B and D genome donors of wheat, Triticum urartu (A), Aegilops speltoides
   (S) and Aegilops tauschii (D). Additional taxa containing the A genome,
   Triticum monococcum and its wild relative Triticum boeoticum, were also
   included. The main focus of the analysis was on the genomic composition
   of TEs as these make up at least 80\% of the overall genome content.
   Although more than 200 TE families were identified in each species,
   approximately 50\% of the overall genome comprised 12-15 TE families.
   The BARE1 element was the largest contributor to all genomes,
   contributing more than 10\% to the overall genome. We also found that
   several TE families differ strongly in their abundance between species,
   indicating that TE families can thrive extremely successfully in one
   species while going virtually extinct in another. Additionally, the
   nucleotide diversity of BARE1 populations within individual genomes was
   measured. Interestingly, the nucleotide diversity in the domesticated
   barley H. vulgare cv. Barke was found to be twice as high as in its wild
   progenitor H. spontaneum, suggesting that the domesticated barley gained
   nucleotide diversity from the addition of different genotypes during the
   domestication and breeding process. In the rye/wheat lineage, sequence
   diversity of BARE1 elements was generally higher, suggesting that
   factors such as geographical distribution and mating systems might play
   a role in intragenomic TE diversity.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES \& IMPACTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{715-720}},
Abstract = {{Careful extraction and analysis of porewater from sediment cores are
   critical for the investigation of small-scale biogeochemical processes.
   Firstly, small sample volumes and high spatial resolution are required.
   Secondly, several chemical species in the anaerobic porewater are
   sensitive to oxidation when brought in contact with ambient air. Here we
   present the combination of a special sampling technique and an
   analytical method for the porewater extraction of a varved sediment core
   from Lake Baldegg in central Switzerland, using MicroRhizon samplers and
   a portable capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument. MicroRhizon filter
   tubes of 1 mm diameter and 20 mm length are suitable for fast retrieval
   of particle-free porewater samples directly from the sediment core.
   Since the time-span between sampling and analysis is less than 20
   seconds, oxygen-sensitive Fe(II) can be analyzed in one go together with
   Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, NH4+, and Mn(II) without splitting, acidification
   or dilution of the sample. The major inorganic cations and anions of the
   sediment porewater can be determined in less than 15 minutes. Detection
   limits are in the sub-micromolar concentration range. The capillary
   electrophoresis instrument used in this study requires sample volumes of
   only 20 mu L. These remarkable small sample volumes allow the
   minimization of disturbance of the sediment cores and a high spatial
   resolution of the sediment profile, even in sediments with low water
   content. The equipment is inexpensive, easy to handle, fully portable
   and therefore suitable for environmental on-site applications.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   Although the net biodiversity effect (NE) can be statistically
   partitioned into complementarity and selection effects (CE and SE),
   there are different underlying mechanisms that can cause a certain
   partitioning. Our objective was to assess the role of resource
   partitioning and species interactions as two important mechanisms that
   can bring about CEs by interspecific and intraspecific trait variation.
   Methods
   We measured tree height of 2493 living individuals in 57 plots and
   specific root length (SRL) on first-order roots of 368 of these
   individuals across different species richness levels (1, 2, 4, 8
   species) in a large-scale forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
   experiment in subtropical China (BEF-China) established in 2009. We
   describe the effects of resource partitioning between species by a fixed
   component of interspecific functional diversity (RaoQ) and further
   effects of species interactions by variable components of interspecific
   and intraspecific functional diversity (community weighted trait
   similarity and trait dissimilarity, CWS and CWD). Finally, we examined
   the relationships between biodiversity effects on stand-level tree
   height and functional diversity (RaoQ, CWS and CWD) in SRL using linear
   regression and assessed the relative importance of these three
   components of functional diversity in explaining the diversity effects.
   Important Findings
   Our results show that species richness significantly affected SRL in
   five and tree height in ten out of 16 species. A positive NE was
   generally brought about by a positive CE on stand-level tree height and
   related to high values of RaoQ and CWS in SRL. A positive CE was related
   to high values of all three components of root functional diversity
   (RaoQ, CWS and CWD). Our study suggests that both resource partitioning
   and species interactions are the underlying mechanisms of biodiversity
   effects on stand-level tree growth in subtropical forest.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitic species, which depend directly on host species for their
   survival, represent a major regulatory force in ecosystems and a
   significant component of Earth's biodiversity. Yet the negative impacts
   of parasites observed at the host level have motivated a conservation
   paradigm of eradication, moving us farther from attainment of
   taxonomically unbiased conservation goals. Despite a growing body of
   literature highlighting the importance of parasite-inclusive
   conservation, most parasite species remain understudied, underfunded,
   and underappreciated. We argue the protection of parasitic biodiversity
   requires a paradigm shift in the perception and valuation of their role
   as consumer species, similar to that of apex predators in the mid-20th
   century. Beyond recognizing parasites as vital trophic regulators,
   existing tools available to conservation practitioners should explicitly
   account for the unique threats facing dependent species. We built upon
   concepts from epidemiology and economics (e.g., host-density threshold
   and cost-benefit analysis) to devise novel metrics of margin of error
   and minimum investment for parasite conservation. We define margin of
   error as the risk of accidental host extinction from misestimating
   equilibrium population sizes and predicted oscillations, while minimum
   investment represents the cost associated with conserving the additional
   hosts required to maintain viable parasite populations. This framework
   will aid in the identification of readily conserved parasites that
   present minimal health risks. To establish parasite conservation, we
   propose an extension of population viability analysis for host-parasite
   assemblages to assess extinction risk. In the direst cases, ex situ
   breeding programs for parasites should be evaluated to maximize success
   without undermining host protection. Though parasitic species pose a
   considerable conservation challenge, adaptations to conservation tools
   will help protect parasite biodiversity in the face of an uncertain
   environmental future.
   Resumen Las especies parasitas, aquellas que dependen directamente de
   las especies hospederas para sobrevivir, representan una gran fuerza
   regulatoria dentro de los ecosistemas y un componente significativo de
   la biodiversidad de la Tierra. Aun asi, los impactos negativos de los
   parasitos que se han observado a nivel del hospedero han motivado un
   paradigma de conservacion enfocado en la erradicacion, lo que nos aleja
   cada vez mas de alcanzar objetivos de conservacion sin sesgos
   taxonomicos. A pesar de la creciente bibliografia que resalta la
   importancia de la conservacion incluyente de los parasitos, la mayoria
   de este tipo de especies sigue siendo poco estudiada, mal financiada y
   poco valorada. Argumentamos que la proteccion de la diversidad
   parasitaria requiere de un cambio en el paradigma de la percepcion y
   valoracion de su papel como especies consumidoras, similar al de los
   depredadores primarios a mediados del siglo XX. Mas alla de reconocer a
   los parasitos como reguladores troficos vitales, las herramientas
   existentes disponibles para quienes practican la conservacion deberian
   reconocer explicitamente las amenazas unicas que enfrentan las especies
   dependientes. Partimos de conceptos de epidemiologia y economia (p. ej.:
   umbral de densidad de hospedero y analisis de costo-beneficio) para
   disenar medidas novedosas del margen de error y la inversion minima para
   la conservacion de parasitos. Definimos el margen de error como el
   riesgo de extincion accidental del hospedero a partir de una mala
   estimacion del tamano de poblaciones en equilibrio y de los pronosticos
   de oscilacion, mientras que la inversion minima representa el costo
   asociado a la conservacion de los hospederos adicionales requeridos para
   mantener viables a las poblaciones de parasitos. Este marco de trabajo
   ayudara en la identificacion de los parasitos conservados inmediatamente
   que presentan un riesgo sanitario minimo. Para establecer la
   conservacion de parasitos, proponemos una extension del analisis de
   viabilidad poblacional para los conjuntos de hospedero-parasito y asi
   evaluar el riesgo de extincion. En los casos mas urgentes, se deberian
   evaluar programas de crianza ex situ para maximizar el exito sin
   debilitar la proteccion al hospedero. Aunque las especies parasitas
   presentan un reto considerable para la conservacion, las adaptaciones de
   las herramientas de conservacion ayudaran a proteger la diversidad de
   parasitos de frente a un futuro ambiental incierto.}},

Abstract = {{Proximity to the coast and elevation are important geographical
   considerations for human settlement. Little is known, however, about how
   spatial variation in these factors exactly relates to human settlements
   and activities, and how this has developed over time. Such knowledge is
   important for identifying vulnerable regions that are at risk from
   phenomena such as food shortages and water stress. Human activities are
   a key driving force in global change, and thus detailed information on
   population distribution is an important input to any research framework
   on global change. In this paper we assess the global geospatial patterns
   of the distribution of human population and related factors, with regard
   to the altitude above sea level and proximity to the coast. The
   investigated factors are physical conditions, urbanisation, agricultural
   practices, economy, and environmental stress. An important novel element
   in this study, is that we included the temporal evolution in various
   factors related to human settlements and agricultural practices over the
   20th century, and used projections for some of these factors up to the
   year 2050. We found population pressure in the proximity of the coast to
   be somewhat greater than was found in other studies. Yet, the
   distribution of population, urbanisation and wealth are evolving to
   become more evenly spread across the globe than they were in the past.
   Therefore, the commonly believed tendency of accumulation of people and
   wealth along coasts is not supported by our results. At the same time,
   food production is becoming increasingly decoupled from the trends in
   population density. Croplands are spreading from highly populated
   coastal zones towards inland zones. Our results thus indicate that even
   though people and wealth continue to accumulate in proximity to the
   coast, population densities and economic productivity are becoming less
   diverse in relation to elevation and distance from the coast.}},

Abstract = {{Material flow modeling constitutes an important approach to predicting
   and understanding the flows of materials through the anthroposphere into
   the environment. The new ``Dynamic Probabilistic Material Flow Analysis
   (DPMFA){''} method, combining dynamic material flow modeling with
   probabilistic modeling, is presented in this paper. Material transfers
   that lead to particular environmental stocks are represented as systems
   of mass-balanced flows. The time-dynamic behavior of the system is
   calculated by adding up the flows over several consecutive periods,
   considering changes in the inflow to the system and intermediate delays
   in local stocks. Incomplete parameter knowledge is represented and
   propagated using Bayesian modeling. The method is implemented as a
   simulation framework in Python to support experts from different domains
   in the development of their application models. After the introduction
   of the method and its implementation, a case study is presented in which
   the framework is applied to predict the environmental concentrations of

Abstract = {{1. Food security is currently considered a major global problem.
   However, increasing intensity of food production in agricultural systems
   has driven reductions in farmland biodiversity. A major challenge is to
   enable biodiversity conservation whilst addressing the problem of food
   security.
   2. Here we describe how facilitative plant-plant interactions in crop
   systems could be used to help strike this balance. An obvious example is
   that of intercropping systems, where combinations of crop species can -
   under some circumstances - deliver reduced inputs of agrochemicals
   (fertilizers, pesticides) per unit yield, with potential knock-on
   benefits for biodiversity conservation.
   3. Other facilitative processes can also play a role in biodiversity
   conservation. Increased intraspecific crop genetic diversity can help
   protect crops from pests and diseases. Although overlooked in
   facilitation research, we argue that the mechanisms operate in a manner
   which is directly analogous to associational defence against herbivores,
   a process well recognized in the facilitation literature. As with
   intercropping, the benefits to nature conservation arise from reduced
   pesticide use per unit harvested crop.
   4. Crops may have facilitative effects on some arable weed species,
   particularly those that are currently considered rare in intensive
   farming systems. Work is in its early stages to understand the
   underlying mechanisms, but it appears that crops might create niche
   space to which some weed species are adapted. Increasing plant species
   diversity through niche space creation may then have cascading benefits
   for other components of farmland biodiversity.
   5. Our new understanding of facilitative processes arising from work on
   crop systems has lessons for the study of facilitative interactions in
   natural and semi-natural communities. We argue that, although easier to
   identify and quantify in crop systems, some of these facilitative
   processes have to date been overlooked in studies of non-crop systems
   and certainly deserve further consideration.
   6. Finally, we discuss what steps may be needed to move from our
   understanding of the role of facilitation to the development of new
   agricultural practice. In some cases the challenge may be one of the
   encouraging uptake of existing practices, and in others more research is
   needed to understand how new ecological understanding might deliver more
   sustainable agricultural practice.}},

Abstract = {{Biological monitoring has a long history in freshwaters, where much of
   the pioneering work in this field was developed over a 100 years ago-but
   few of the traditional monitoring tools provide the global perspective
   on biodiversity loss and its consequences for ecosystem functioning that
   are now needed. Rather than forcing existing monitoring paradigms to
   respond to questions they were never originally designed to address, we
   need to take a step back and assess the prospects for novel approaches
   that could be developed and adopted in the future. To resolve some of
   the issues with indicators currently used to inform policymakers, we
   highlight new biological monitoring tools that are being used, or could
   be developed in the near future, which (1) consider less-studied
   taxonomic groups, (2) are standardised across regions to allow global
   comparisons, and (3) measure change over multiple time points. The new
   tools we suggest make use of some of the key technological and
   logistical advances seen in recent years-including remote sensing,
   molecular tools, and local-to-global citizen science networks. We
   recommend that these new indicators should be considered in future
   assessments of freshwater ecosystem health and contribute to the
   evidence base for global to regional (and national) assessments of
   biodiversity and ecosystem services: for example, within the emerging
   framework of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and
   Ecosystem Services.}},

Abstract = {{Most plastid isoprenoids, including photosynthesis-related metabolites
   such as carotenoids and the side chain of chlorophylls, tocopherols
   (vitamin E), phylloquinones (vitamin K), and plastoquinones, derive from
   geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthesized by GGPP synthase (GGPPS)
   enzymes. Seven out of 10 functional GGPPS isozymes in Arabidopsis
   thaliana reside in plastids. We aimed to address the function of
   different GGPPS paralogues for plastid isoprenoid biosynthesis.
   We constructed a gene co-expression network (GCN) using GGPPS paralogues
   as guide genes and genes from the upstream and downstream pathways as
   query genes. Furthermore, knock-out and/or knock-down ggpps mutants were
   generated and their growth and metabolic phenotypes were analyzed. Also,
   interacting protein partners of GGPPS11 were searched for.
   Our data showed that GGPPS11, encoding the only plastid isozyme
   essential for plant development, functions as a hub gene among GGPPS
   paralogues and is required for the production of all major groups of
   plastid isoprenoids. Furthermore, we showed that the GGPPS11 protein
   physically interacts with enzymes that use GGPP for the production of
   carotenoids, chlorophylls, tocopherols, phylloquinone, and
   plastoquinone.
   GGPPS11 is a hub isozyme required for the production of most
   photosynthesis-related isoprenoids. Both gene co-expression and
   protein-protein interaction likely contribute to the channeling of GGPP
   by GGPPS11.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we examine available glacier mass-balance records between 1993 and
   2012 for Andes Cordillera, South America (6.5 degrees N-45.8 degrees S),
   and the sub-Antarctic islands around the northern tip of the Antarctic
   Peninsula (62.7 degrees S-63.8 degrees S) to determine their recent mass
   loss and imbalance with the present climate. The mean annual observed
   mass-balance B-a changed from similar to 620 +/- 390 (1993-2002) to -740
   +/- 240 kg m(-2) yr(-1) (2003-2012) and for this past decade showed a
   decrease in Ba from south to north. These glaciers had a mean
   accumulation area ratio of 0.42, which is below the AAR value for
   glaciers in equilibrium, reflecting mean area and volume imbalances of
   23\% and 27\%, respectively. Glaciers in the northern part of Andes
   Cordillera are most out of balance with the present climate (33\%),
   while glaciers on the sub-Antarctic islands are only slightly out of
   balance (4\%). We identified a spatiotemporal cycle of B-a that
   distinguishes glaciers on the sub-Antarctic islands from glaciers in the
   Andes using an Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis. This analysis
   also revealed that South America should be divided into three individual
   glacier regions, and not two regions as earlier stated. Overall, the
   spatiotemporal cycles identified correlate to the multivariate El Nino
   Southern Oscillation Index instantaneously (zero-year lag-time) and to
   the Pacific Decadal Oscillation with an approximately eight-year
   lag-time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal and the underlying movement behaviour are processes of pivotal
   importance for understanding and predicting metapopulation and
   metacommunity dynamics. Generally, dispersal decisions are
   condition-dependent and rely on information in the broad sense, like the
   presence of conspecifics. However, studies on metacommunities that
   include interspecific interactions generally disregard
   condition-dependence. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how
   dispersal in metacommunities is condition-dependent and whether rules
   derived from single-species contexts can be scaled up to
   (meta)communities. Using experimental protist metacommunities, we show
   how dispersal and movement depend on and are adjusted by the strength of
   interspecific interactions. We found that the predicting movement and
   dispersal in metacommunities requires knowledge on behavioural responses
   to intra- and interspecific interaction strengths. Consequently,
   metacommunity dynamics inferred directly from single-species
   metapopulations without taking interspecific interactions into account
   are likely flawed. Our work identifies the significance of
   condition-dependence for understanding metacommunity dynamics, stability
   and the coexistence and distribution of species.}},

Title = {{Spectral alignment of multi-temporal cross-sensor images with automated

Journal = {{ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{50-63}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an approach to perform relative spectral
   alignment between optical cross-sensor acquisitions. The proposed method
   aims at projecting the images from two different and possibly disjoint
   input spaces into a common latent space, in which standard change
   detection algorithms can be applied. The system relies on the
   regularized kernel canonical correlation analysis transformation (kCCA),
   which can accommodate nonlinear dependencies between pixels by means of
   kernel functions. To learn the projections, the method employs a subset
   of samples belonging to the unchanged areas or to uninteresting
   radiometric differences. Since the availability of ground truth
   information to perform model selection is limited, we propose a
   completely automatic strategy to select the hyperparameters of the
   system as well as the dimensionality of the transformed (latent) space.
   The proposed scheme is fully automatic and allows the use of any change
   detection algorithm in the transformed latent space. A synthetic problem
   built from real images and a case study involving a real cross-sensor
   change detection problem illustrate the capabilities of the proposed
   method. Results show that the proposed system outperforms the linear
   baseline and provides accuracies close the ones obtained with a fully
   supervised strategy. We provide a MATLAB implementation of the proposed
   method as well as the real cross-sensor data we prepared and employed at
   https://sites.google.com/site/michelevolpiresearch/codes/cross-sensor.

Title = {{Facing unprecedented drying of the Central Andes? Precipitation
   variability over the period AD 1000-2100}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Projected future trends in water availability are associated with large
   uncertainties in many regions of the globe. In mountain areas with
   complex topography, climate models have often limited capabilities to
   adequately simulate the precipitation variability on small spatial
   scales. Also, their validation is hampered by typically very low station
   density. In the Central Andes of South America, a semi-arid
   high-mountain region with strong seasonality, zonal wind in the upper
   troposphere is a good proxy for interannual precipitation variability.
   Here, we combine instrumental measurements, reanalysis and paleoclimate
   data, and a 57-member ensemble of CMIP5 model simulations to assess
   changes in Central Andes precipitation over the period AD 1000-2100.
   This new database allows us to put future projections of precipitation
   into a previously missing multi-centennial and pre-industrial context.
   Our results confirm the relationship between regional summer
   precipitation and 200 hPa zonal wind in the Central Andes, with stronger
   Westerly winds leading to decreased precipitation. The period of
   instrumental coverage (1965-2010) is slightly dryer compared to
   pre-industrial times as represented by control simulations, simulations
   from the past Millennium, ice core data from Quelccaya ice cap and a
   tree-ring based precipitation reconstruction. The model ensemble
   identifies a clear reduction in precipitation already in the early 21st
   century: the 10 year running mean model uncertainty range (ensemble
   16-84\% spread) is continuously above the pre-industrial mean after AD
   2023 (AD 2028) until the end of the 21st century in the RCP2.6 (RCP8.5)
   emission scenario. Average precipitation over AD 2071-2100 is outside
   the range of natural pre-industrial variability in 47 of the 57 model
   simulations for both emission scenarios. The ensemble median fraction of
   dry years (defined by the 5th percentile in pre-industrial conditions)
   is projected to increase by a factor of 4 until 2071-2100 in the RCP8.5
   scenario. Even under the strong reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
   projected by the RCP2.6 scenario, the Central Andes will experience a
   reduction in precipitation outside pre-industrial natural variability.
   This is of concern for the Central Andes, because society and economy
   are highly vulnerable to changes in the hydrological cycle and already
   have to face decreases in fresh water availability caused by glacier
   retreat.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat loss due to anthropogenic activities is a critical threat to
   biodiversity. Understanding which factors determine species persistence
   in degraded environments is essential for conservation management. Here,
   we investigated how aerial insectivorous bats in the Neotropics, an
   ecologically important, but understudied group of vertebrates, are
   affected by deforestation and urbanization. We conducted a standardized
   acoustic survey in four habitat types in 14 areas across Panama (500 km
   x 260 km), a scale hitherto unprecedented for the Neotropics, and
   assessed occupancy in 13 aerial insectivorous bat species, accounting
   for species- and habitat-specific detectability. In addition, we used
   wing measures to derive a proxy for flight efficiency and flight speed,
   as an indication of species-specific mobility. Results show that
   detectability does not only vary strongly among species but also, within
   a species, depending on the habitat: for nine species intra-specific
   detectability varied >10\%. Model estimates for occupancy revealed that
   aerial insectivorous bats are highly heterogeneous in their response to
   deforestation and urbanization. Canopy height and canopy cover predicted
   occupancy best for most species. Relating occupancy to mobility we found
   that less mobile species with broad wings (high wing loading and low
   aspect ratio) decrease occupancy in deforested and urban areas, while
   more mobile species with narrow wings increase in these habitats. We
   suggest that this pattern applies also to species not analyzed in this
   study. Our study exemplifies how morphological information can help
   define conservation priorities when information on occurrence and
   distribution is limited. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs) are remarkable in their species
   richness and endemism, but the processes that have led to this diversity
   remain enigmatic. Here, we hypothesize that continent-dependent
   speciation and extinction rates have led to disparity in diversity
   between the five MTEs of the world: the Cape, California, Mediterranean
   Basin, Chile, and Western Australia. To test this hypothesis, we built a
   phylogenetic tree for 280 Rhamnaceae species, estimated divergence times
   using eight fossil calibrations, and used Bayesian methods and
   simulations to test for differences in diversification rates. Rhamnaceae
   lineages in MTEs generally show higher diversification rates than
   elsewhere, but speciation and extinction dynamics show a pattern of
   continent-dependence. We detected high speciation and extinction rates
   in California and significantly lower extinction rates in the Cape and
   Western Australia. The independent colonization of four of five MTEs may
   have occurred conterminously in the Oligocene/Early Miocene, but
   colonization of the Mediterranean Basin happened later, in the Late
   Miocene. This suggests that the in situ radiations of these clades were
   initiated before the onset of winter rainfall in these regions. These
   results indicate independent evolutionary histories of Rhamnaceae in
   MTEs, possibly related to the intensity of climate oscillations and the
   geological history of the regions.}},

Title = {{Gauging the Ungauged Basin: Relative Value of Soft and Hard Data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The long-standing issue of hydrological predictions in ungauged basins
   has received increased attention due to the recent International
   Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) decade on predictions in
   ungauged basins (PUB). Since the outset of PUB, many have noted that the
   best way to confront an ungauged basin is to first make some basic
   streamflow measurements. This study explores the value of a rudimentary
   gauging campaign for making predictions in an ungauged basin. The
   well-studied Maimai watershed in New Zealand was used as a hypothetical
   ungauged basin, and this study was designed to start with no runoff data
   and add iteratively different subsets of the available data to constrain
   the calibration of a simple three-reservoir conceptual catchment model.
   These subsets included single runoff events or a limited number of point
   values-in other words, what could be measured with limited,
   campaign-like field efforts in an ungauged basin. In addition, different
   types of soft data were explored to constrain the model calibration.
   Model simulations were validated using the available runoff data from
   different years. It was found that surprisingly little runoff data were
   necessary to derive model parameterizations that provided good results
   for the validation periods, especially when these runoff data were
   combined with soft data. The relative value of soft data increased with
   decreasing amount of streamflow data. The findings from the Maimai
   watershed suggest that, when starting with no flow information, one
   event or 10 observations during high flow provide almost as much
   information as three months of continuously measured streamflow for
   constraining the calibration of a simple catchment model. (C) 2014

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{281}},

Abstract = {{The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are a key
   component of the adaptive immune system and among the most variable loci
   in the vertebrate genome. Pathogen-mediated natural selection and
   MHC-based disassortative mating are both thought to structure MHC
   polymorphism, but their effects have proven difficult to discriminate in
   natural systems. Using the first model of MHC dynamics incorporating
   both survival and reproduction, we demonstrate that natural and sexual
   selection produce distinctive signatures of MHC allelic diversity with
   critical implications for understanding host-pathogen dynamics. While
   natural selection produces the Red Queen dynamics characteristic of
   host-parasite interactions, disassortative mating stabilizes allele
   frequencies, damping major fluctuations in dominant alleles and
   protecting functional variants against drift. This subtle difference
   generates a complex interaction between MHC allelic diversity and
   population size. In small populations, the stabilizing effects of sexual
   selection moderate the effects of drift, whereas pathogen-mediated
   selection accelerates the loss of functionally important genetic
   diversity. Natural selection enhances MHC allelic variation in larger
   populations, with the highest levels of diversity generated by the
   combined action of pathogen-mediated selection and disassortative
   mating. MHC-based sexual selection may help to explain how functionally
   important genetic variation can be maintained in populations of
   conservation concern.}},

Abstract = {{In southwestern China and Southeast Asia modern geology and topography
   have been influenced strongly by the collision between the Indian and
   Eurasian plates. The southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is well
   known for its high biodiversity and diverse vegetation types. While the
   present diversity is explained by the geological history of this region,
   to date no study has looked at how past vegetation was shaped by
   geological and topographical history. In this study, we focus on three
   coeval late Miocene leaf assemblages from Yunnan: Lincang, Xiaolongtan
   and Xianfeng. The palaeoelevation of these three sites is reconstructed
   using enthalpy as a palaeoaltimeter. Enthalpy at the fossil site is
   reconstructed based on leaf physiognomy; the difference between this
   enthalpy and enthalpy at sea-level is used as a proxy for altitude. The
   palaeoaltitudes are resolved as 214 +/- 901 m asl for Lincang, 530 +/-
   901 m asl for Xiaolongtan, and 1936 +/- 901 m asl for Xianfeng. The
   floristic components of these floras are analysed for their geographical
   elements. There is a gradient in the percentage of tropical genera
   between the three floras from Lincang, at the lowest elevation, to
   Xianfeng, at the highest level. For Lincang, this percentage exceeds the
   threshold used to define present day tropical regions. Our results
   demonstrate that there as already a floristic differentiation in Yunnan
   during the late Miocene. Floras with tropical affinities were at low
   altitude, whereas floras with temperate affinities were at high
   altitude. With the later uplift of southern Yunnan, floras with tropical
   affinities retreated to the south where they are still present. The
   uplift framework reconstructed in this paper gives a tectonic context
   for further studies on the impact of uplift on biodiversity. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{A life-history trade-off between low mortality in the dark and rapid
   growth in the light is one of the most widely accepted mechanisms
   underlying plant ecological strategies in tropical forests. Differences
   in plant functional traits are thought to underlie these distinct
   ecological strategies; however, very few studies have shown
   relationships between functional traits and demographic rates within a
   functional group. We present 8years of growth and mortality data from
   saplings of 15 species of Dipterocarpaceae planted into logged-over
   forest in Malaysian Borneo, and the relationships between these
   demographic rates and four key functional traits: wood density, specific
   leaf area (SLA), seed mass, and leaf C:N ratio. Species-specific
   differences in growth rates were separated from seedling size effects by
   fitting nonlinear mixed-effects models, to repeated measurements taken
   on individuals at multiple time points. Mortality data were analyzed
   using binary logistic regressions in a mixed-effects models framework.
   Growth increased and mortality decreased with increasing light
   availability. Species differed in both their growth and mortality rates,
   yet there was little evidence for a statistical interaction between
   species and light for either response. There was a positive relationship
   between growth rate and the predicted probability of mortality
   regardless of light environment, suggesting that this relationship may
   be driven by a general trade-off between traits that maximize growth and
   traits that minimize mortality, rather than through differential species
   responses to light. Our results indicate that wood density is an
   important trait that indicates both the ability of species to grow and
   resistance to mortality, but no other trait was correlated with either
   growth or mortality. Therefore, the growth mortality trade-off among
   species of dipterocarp appears to be general in being independent of
   species crossovers in performance in different light environments.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first high-resolution (500m x 500m) gridded methane (CH4)
   emission inventory for Switzerland, which integrates 90\% of the
   national emission totals reported to the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and recent CH4 flux studies
   conducted by research groups across Switzerland. In addition to
   anthropogenic emissions, we also include natural and semi-natural CH4
   fluxes, i.e., emissions from lakes and reservoirs, wetlands, wild
   animals as well as uptake by forest soils. National CH4 emissions were
   disaggregated using detailed geostatistical information on source
   locations and their spatial extent and process-or area-specific emission
   factors. In Switzerland, the highest CH4 emissions in 2011 originated
   from the agricultural sector (150 GgCH(4) yr(-1)), mainly produced by
   ruminants and manure management, followed by emissions from waste
   management (15 GgCH(4) yr(-1)) mainly from landfills and the energy
   sector (12 GgCH(4) yr(-1)), which was dominated by emissions from
   natural gas distribution. Compared with the anthropogenic sources,
   emissions from natural and semi-natural sources were relatively small (6
   GgCH(4) yr(-1)), making up only 3\% of the total emissions in
   Switzerland. CH4 fluxes from agricultural soils were estimated to be not
   significantly different from zero (between -1.5 and 0 GgCH(4) yr(-1)),
   while forest soils are a CH4 sink (approx. -2.8 GgCH(4) yr(-1)),
   partially offsetting other natural emissions. Estimates of uncertainties
   are provided for the different sources, including an estimate of spatial
   disaggregation errors deduced from a comparison with a global (EDGAR
   v4.2) and an European (TNO/MACC) CH4 inventory. This new spatially
   explicit emission inventory for Switzerland will provide valuable input
   for regional-scale atmospheric modeling and inverse source estimation.}},

Journal = {{HABITAT INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{Cleaning shared toilets is important if users are to receive the
   significant health, social and economic benefits associated with having
   access to these facilities. However, achieving and maintaining hygienic
   toilets shared by several user households in urban slums is usually a
   challenge. This study assesses determinants of households' cleaning
   intention for shared toilets in Kampala, Uganda. Using a structured
   questionnaire for the household interviews and an observation checklist,
   data from 1019 users of shared toilets was collected in 50 randomly
   selected urban slums. Data analysis showed that most of the shared
   toilets are unhygienic. Less than a quarter of the shared toilets, for
   instance, were hygienically clean to users' satisfaction. The main
   cleaning intention determinants (p-value <.05) included: importance of
   using a clean toilet, the effort involved in cleaning the toilet, the
   disgust felt from using a dirty toilet, and cleaning habits. Although it
   is important to have access to sanitation facilities, emphasis should be
   placed on how to engage users to ensure that the facilities used are
   appropriately cleaned and maintained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Correction of Reflectance Anisotropy Effects of Vegetation on Airborne
   Spectroscopy Data and Derived Products}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Directional effects in airborne imaging spectrometer (IS) data are
   mainly caused by anisotropic reflectance behavior of surfaces, commonly
   described by bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (BRDF).
   The radiometric and spectral accuracy of IS data is known to be highly
   influenced by such effects, which prevents consistent comparison of
   products. Several models were developed to approximate surface
   reflectance anisotropy for multi-angular observations. Few studies were
   carried out using such models for airborne flight lines where only a
   single observation is available for each ground location. In the present
   work, we quantified and corrected reflectance anisotropy on a single
   airborne HyMap flight line using a Ross-Li model. We stratified the
   surface in two vegetation structural types (different in vertical
   structuring) using spectral angle mapping, to generate a structure
   dependent set of angular observations. We then derived a suite of
   products {[}indices (structure insensitive pigment index, normalized
   difference vegetation index, simple ratio index, and anthocyanin
   reflectance index) and inversion-based (SAIL/PROSPECT-leaf area index,
   Cw, Cdm, Cab)] from corrected and uncorrected images. Non-parametric
   analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) showed throughout significant
   improvements in products from corrected images. Data correction
   resulting in airborne nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance (aNBAR) showed
   uncertainty reductions from 60 to 100\% (p-value = 0.05) as compared to
   uncorrected and nadir observations. Using sparse IS data acquisitions,
   the use of fully parametrized BRDF models is limited. Our normalization
   scheme is straightforward and can be applied with illumination and
   observation geometry being the only a priori information. We recommend
   aNBAR generation to precede any higher level airborne IS product
   generation based on reflectance data.}},

Abstract = {{Top predators significantly impact ecosystem dynamics and act as
   important indicator species for ecosystem health. However, reliable
   density estimates for top predators, considered necessary for the
   development of management plans and ecosystem monitoring, are
   challenging to obtain. This study aims to establish baseline density
   estimates for two top predators, spotted hyena and lion, in the Okavango
   Delta in northern Botswana. Using calling stations, we surveyed
   free-ranging populations of the two species and investigated
   methodological variables that might influence results about
   distributions and densities, including habitat type, seasonality, and
   different types of playback sounds. Calling stations were distributed
   over a survey area of approximately 1,800 km(2) characterized by three
   major habitat types: mopane woodland, floodplain and mixed acacia
   sandveld. Results indicate spotted hyenas were evenly distributed
   independent of habitat type and season throughout the survey area with
   an overall density estimate of 14.4 adults/100 km(2). In contrast, lion
   distribution and density varied significantly with habitat and season.
   Lion density in the prey-poor mopane woodland was near zero, while in
   the comparatively prey-rich floodplains it was estimated at 23.1
   individuals/100 km(2) resulting in a weighted average density of 5.8
   individuals/100 km(2) across the entire study area. In testing the
   effect of varying playback sounds we found that both species were
   significantly more likely to respond to calls of conspecifics. Our
   results show how several methodological variables may influence density
   estimates and emphasize the importance of standardized calling-station
   survey methods to allow consistent replication of surveys and comparison
   of results that can be used for landscape-scale monitoring of large
   predator species.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas the transport of solutes in nonreactive porous media can mostly
   be described by diffusion driven by the concentration gradients in the
   external bulk water phase, the situation for dense clays and clay rocks
   has been less clear for a long time. The presence of fixed negative
   surface charges complicates the application of Fick's laws in the case
   of ionic species. Here we report the seeming uphill diffusion of a
   Na-22(+) tracer in compacted sodium montmorillonite, that is, transport
   directed from a low to a high tracer concentration reservoir. In
   contrast to the classical through-diffusion technique the present
   experiments were carried out under the conditions of a gradient in the
   background electrolyte and using equal initial Na-22(+) tracer
   concentrations on both sides of the clay sample. We conclude that the
   dominant driving force for diffusion is the concentration gradient of
   exchangeable cations in the nanopores. Commonly used diffusion models,
   based on concentration gradients in the external bulk water phase, may
   thus predict incorrect fluxes both in terms of magnitude and direction.}},

Abstract = {{Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood (Mi) is the most
   economically damaging species of the root-knot nematode to soybean and
   other crops in the southern USA. PI 96354 was identified to carry a high
   level of resistance to galling and Mi egg production. Two Quantitative
   Trait Locus (QTLs) were found to condition the resistance in PI 96354
   including a major QTL and a minor QTL on chromosome 10 and chromosome
   18, respectively. To fine map the major QTL on chromosome 10, F-5:6
   recombinant inbred lines from the cross between PI 96354 and susceptible
   genotype Bossier were genotyped with Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR)
   markers to identify recombinational events. Analysis of lines carrying
   key recombination events placed the Mi-resistant allele on chromosome 10
   to a 235-kb region of the `Williams 82' genome sequence with 30
   annotated genes. Candidate gene analysis identified four genes with cell
   wall modification function that have several mutations in promoter,
   exon, 5', and 3'UTR regions. qPCR analysis showed significant difference
   in expression levels of these four genes in Bossier compared to PI 96354
   in the presence of Mi. Thirty Mi-resistant soybean lines were found to
   have same SNPs in these 4 candidate genes as PI 96354 while 12
   Mi-susceptible lines possess the `Bossier' genotype. The mutant SNPs
   were used to develop KASP assays to detect the resistant allele on
   chromosome 10. The four candidate genes identified in this study can be
   used in further studies to investigate the role of cell wall
   modification genes in conferring Mi resistance in PI 96354.}},

Title = {{Experimentally testing the accuracy of an extinction estimator: Solow's
   optimal linear estimation model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{345-354}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Mathematical methods for inferring time to extinction have been widely
   applied but poorly tested. Optimal linear estimation (also called the
   Weibull' or Weibull extreme value' model) infers time to extinction from
   a temporal distribution of species sightings. Previous studies have
   suggested optimal linear estimation provides accurate estimates of
   extinction time for some species; however, an in-depth test of the
   technique is lacking. The use of data from wild populations to gauge the
   error associated with estimations is often limited by very approximate
   estimates of the actual extinction date and poor sighting records.
   Microcosms provide a system in which the accuracy of estimations can be
   tested against known extinction dates, whilst incorporating a variety of
   extinction rates created by changing environmental conditions, species
   identity and species richness. We present the first use of experimental
   microcosm data to exhaustively test the accuracy of one sighting-based
   method of inferring time of extinction under a range of search efforts,
   search regimes, sighting frequencies and extinction rates. Our results
   show that the accuracy of optimal linear estimation can be affected by
   both observer-controlled parameters, such as change in search effort,
   and inherent features of the system, such as species identity. Whilst
   optimal linear estimation provides generally accurate and precise
   estimates, the technique is susceptible to both overestimation and
   underestimation of extinction date. Microcosm experiments provide a
   framework within which the accuracy of extinction predictors can be
   clearly gauged. Variables such as search effort, search regularity and
   species identity can significantly affect the accuracy of estimates and
   should be taken into account when testing extinction predictors in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past two decades, the development of methods for visualizing
   and analysing specimens digitally, in three and even four dimensions,
   has transformed the study of living and fossil organisms. However, the
   initial promise that the widespread application of such methods would
   facilitate access to the underlying digital data has not been fully
   achieved. The underlying datasets for many published studies are not
   readily or freely available, introducing a barrier to verification and
   reproducibility, and the reuse of data. There is no current agreement or
   policy on the amount and type of data that should be made available
   alongside studies that use, and in some cases are wholly reliant on,
   digital morphology. Here, we propose a set of recommendations for
   minimum standards and additional best practice for three-dimensional
   digital data publication, and review the issues around data storage,

Title = {{Opposing intraspecific vs. interspecific diversity effects on herbivory

Abstract = {{Aims
   Positive plant diversity-ecosystem function relations are ultimately
   driven by variation in functional traits among individuals that form a
   community. To date, research has largely focused on the role of species
   diversity for ecosystem functioning. However, substantial intraspecific
   trait variation is common and a significant part of this variation
   caused by genetic differences among individuals. Here, we studied the
   relative importance of species diversity and seed family (SF) diversity
   within species for growth and herbivory in experimental subtropical tree
   assemblages.
   Methods
   In 2010, we set up a field experiment in subtropical China, using four
   species from the local species pool. Trees were raised from seeds, with
   seeds from the same mother tree forming an SF. We established 23 plots
   containing one or four species (species diversity treatment) and one or
   four SFs per species (SF diversity treatment). Tree growth (stem
   diameter, plant height and crown expansion) and herbivory (percentage
   leaf loss due to leaf chewers) were monitored annually from 2011 to
   2013.
   Important findings
   Tree species richness promoted growth but had no effect on herbivory. In
   contrast, SF diversity reduced growth and increased herbivory but only
   so in species mixtures. Most of the observed effects were time
   dependent, with the largest effect found in 2013. Our results suggest
   that biodiversity can affect plant performance directly via tree
   species-species interactions, or context dependent, via potential
   effects on inter-trophic interactions. Two important conclusions should
   be drawn from our findings. Firstly, in future studies regarding
   biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships,
   intraspecific genetic diversity should be given similar weight as
   species diversity as it has often been neglected and its effects are not
   well understood. Secondly, we demonstrate opposite effects of
   biodiversity among and within species, stressing the importance to
   consider the effects of multiple levels of biodiversity simultaneously.}},

Title = {{Positive effects of tree species richness on fine-root production in a
   subtropical forest in SE-China}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   Fine roots play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of
   terrestrial ecosystems and are vital for understanding forest ecosystem
   functioning and services. Higher plant species diversity has been
   largely reported to increase aboveground community biomass, but how
   biodiversity affects fine-root production and the related mechanisms in
   forests remain unclear. In this study, we aim to answer two questions:
   (i) does fine-root production increase with tree species richness? (ii)
   Can this effect be explained by niche complementarity among species?
   Methods
   We analyzed data from a large forest biodiversity experiment (BEF-China)
   with 5-year-old trees. Fine-root growth was measured as standing biomass
   and annual fine-root regrowth was estimated using ingrowth cores.
   Moreover, relative yield was calculated to test whether over-or
   under-yielding occurred when mixtures were compared with the average
   monoculture of the species included in the mixtures. We calculated
   functional diversity for fine-root (<= 2 mm in diameter) traits by Rao's
   quadratic entropy index for each species mixture. The effects of
   manipulated tree species richness and identity on fine-root traits were
   analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Mixed models were also used
   to test the relationships between tree species richness and fine-root
   standing biomass, annual regrowth and vertical heterogeneity.
   Important Findings
   Fine roots of more than one species were found in half of the soil cores
   in mixtures indicating that belowground interactions in these young
   forest stands occurred much earlier than canopy closure. We found
   significant differences among species in fine-root traits such as
   diameter and specific root length (SRL), which suggested different
   resource-use strategies and niche partitioning among species. Mean
   fine-root diameter of species ranged from 0.31 to 0.74 mm, mean SRL
   ranged from 12.43 m.g(-1) to 70.22 m.g(-1) and mean vertical
   distribution index beta ranged from 0.68 to 0.93. There was a
   significant positive relationship between species richness and the
   evenness of the vertical distribution of fine-root standing biomass.
   Moreover, marginally significant positive relationships existed between
   species richness and standing biomass as well as annual regrowth of fine
   roots. Relative yields and Rao's quadratic entropy index were both not
   significantly affected by species richness. However, the relative yield
   of fine-root standing biomass was marginally correlated with Rao's
   quadratic entropy index, implying that belowground niche complementarity
   between species does contribute to diversity effects. In conclusion, our
   study showed positive effects of species richness on the filling of soil
   volume by fine roots in the studied experimental forest communities.
   This has positive effects on fine-root standing biomass and may also
   lead to increased aboveground biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Canopy structure plays an essential role in biophysical activities in
   forest environments. However, quantitative descriptions of a 3-D canopy
   structure are extremely difficult because of the complexity and
   heterogeneity of forest systems. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides
   an opportunity to automatically measure a 3-D canopy structure in large
   areas. Compared with other point cloud technologies such as the
   image-based Structure from Motion, the power of ALS lies in its ability
   to penetrate canopies and depict subordinate trees. However, such
   capabilities have been poorly explored so far. In this paper, the
   potential of ALS-based approaches in depicting a 3-D canopy structure is
   explored in detail through an international benchmarking of five
   recently developed ALS-based individual tree detection (ITD) methods.
   For the first time, the results of the ITD methods are evaluated for
   each of four crown classes, i.e., dominant, codominant, intermediate,
   and suppressed trees, which provides insight toward understanding the
   current status of depicting a 3-D canopy structure using ITD methods,
   particularly with respect to their performances, potential, and
   challenges. This benchmarking study revealed that the canopy structure
   plays a considerable role in the detection accuracy of ITD methods, and
   its influence is even greater than that of the tree species as well as
   the species composition in a stand. The study also reveals the
   importance of utilizing the point cloud data for the detection of
   intermediate and suppressed trees. Different from what has been reported
   in previous studies, point density was found to be a highly influential
   factor in the performance of the methods that use point cloud data.
   Greater efforts should be invested in the point-based or hybrid ITD
   approaches to model the 3-D canopy structure and to further explore the
   potential of high-density and multiwavelengths ALS data.}},

Abstract = {{Mapping of glacier extents from automated classification of optical
   satellite images has become a major application of the freely available
   images from Landsat. A widely applied method is based on segmented ratio
   images from a red and shortwave infrared band. With the now available
   data from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat 8 (L8) there is high potential to
   further extend the existing time series (starting with Landsat 4/5 in
   1982) and to considerably improve over previous capabilities, thanks to
   increased spatial resolution and dynamic range, a wider swath width and
   more frequent coverage. Here, we test and compare a variety of
   previously used methods to map glacier extents from S2 and L8, and
   investigate the mapping of snow facies with S2 using top of atmosphere
   reflectance. Our results confirm that the band ratio method works well
   with S2 and L8. The 15 m panchromatic band of L8 can be used instead of
   the red band, resulting in glacier extents similar to S2 (0.7\% larger
   for 155 glaciers). On the other hand, extents derived from the 30 m
   bands are 4\%-5\% larger, indicating a more generous interpretation of
   mixed pixels. Mapping of snow cover with S2 provided accurate results,
   but the required topographic correction would benefit from a better
   orthorectification with a more precise DEM than currently used.}},

Abstract = {{Noise annoyance (NA) might lead to behavioral patterns not captured by
   noise levels, which could reduce physical activity (PA) either directly
   or through impaired sleep and constitute a noise pathway towards
   cardiometabolic diseases. We investigated the association of long-term
   transportation NA and its main sources (aircraft, road, and railway) at
   home with PA levels. We assessed 3842 participants (aged 37-81) that
   attended the three examinations (SAP 1, 2, and 3 in years 1991, 2001 and
   2011, respectively) of the population-based Swiss cohort on Air
   Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA). Participants
   reported general 24-h transportation NA (in all examinations) and
   source-specific NA at night (only SAP 3) on an ICBEN-type 11-point
   scale. We assessed moderate, vigorous, and total PA from a
   short-questionnaire (SAP 3). The main outcome was moderate PA
   (active/inactive: cut-off >= 150 min/week). We used logistic regression
   including random effects by area and adjusting for age, sex,
   socioeconomic status, and lifestyles (main model) and evaluated
   potential effect modifiers. We analyzed associations with PA at SAP 3 a)
   cross-sectionally: for source-specific and transportation NA in the last
   year (SAP 3), and b) longitudinally: for 10-y transportation NA (mean of
   SAP 1 + 2), adjusting for prior PA (SAP 2) and changes in NA (SAP 3-2).
   Reported NA (score >= 5) was 16.4\%, 7.5\%, 3\%, and 1.1\% for 1-year
   transportation, road, aircraft, and railway at SAP 3, respectively. NA
   was greater in the past, reaching 28.5\% for 10-y transportation NA (SAP
   1 + 2). The 10-y transportation NA was associated with a 32\% (95\% CI:
   6\%-0.2\%) decrease in moderate PA per 1-NA rating point and was related
   to road and aircraft NA at night in cross-sectional analyses. The
   longitudinal association was stronger for women, reported daytime
   sleepiness or chronic diseases and it was not explained by objectively
   modeled levels of road traffic noise at SAP 3. In conclusion, long-term
   NA (related to psychological noise appraisal) reduced PA and could
   represent another noise pathway towards cardiometabolic diseases. (C)

Abstract = {{Plant growth and architecture is regulated by the polar distribution of
   the hormone auxin. Polarity and flexibility of this process is provided
   by constant cycling of auxin transporter vesicles along actin filaments,
   coordinated by a positive auxin-actin feedback loop. Both polar auxin
   transport and vesicle cycling are inhibited by synthetic auxin transport
   inhibitors, such as 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), counteracting the
   effect of auxin; however, underlying targets and mechanisms are unclear.
   Using NMR, we map the NPA binding surface on the Arabidopsis thaliana
   ABCB chaperone TWISTED DWARF1 (TWD1). We identify ACTIN7 as a relevant,
   although likely indirect, TWD1 interactor, and show TWD1-dependent
   regulation of actin filament organization and dynamics and that TWD1 is
   required for NPA-mediated actin cytoskeleton remodeling. The TWD1-ACTIN7
   axis controls plasma membrane presence of efflux transporters, and as a
   consequence act7 and twd1 share developmental and physiological
   phenotypes indicative of defects in auxin transport. These can be
   phenocopied by NPA treatment or by chemical actin (de) stabilization. We
   provide evidence that TWD1 determines downstreamlocations of auxin
   efflux transporters by adjusting actin filament debundling and
   dynamizing processes and mediating NPA action on the latter. This
   function appears to be evolutionary conserved since TWD1 expression in
   budding yeast alters actin polarization and cell polarity and provides
   NPA sensitivity.}},

Title = {{beta-amylase 1 (BAM1) degrades transitory starch to sustain proline

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1819-1826}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{During photosynthesis of higher plants, absorbed light energy is
   converted into chemical energy that, in part, is accumulated in the form
   of transitory starch within chloroplasts. In the following night,
   transitory starch is mobilized to sustain the heterotrophic metabolism
   of the plant. beta-amylases are glucan hydrolases that cleave
   alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds of starch and release maltose units from the
   non-reducing end of the polysaccharide chain. In Arabidopsis, nocturnal
   degradation of transitory starch involves mainly beta-amylase-3 (BAM3).
   A second beta-amylase isoform, beta-amylase-1 (BAM1), is involved in
   diurnal starch degradation in guard cells, a process that sustains
   stomata opening. However, BAM1 also contributes to diurnal starch
   turnover in mesophyll cells under osmotic stress. With the aim of
   dissecting the role of beta-amylases in osmotic stress responses in
   Arabidopsis, mutant plants lacking either BAM1 or BAM3 were subject to a
   mild (150 mM mannitol) and prolonged (up to one week) osmotic stress. We
   show here that leaves of osmotically-stressed bam1 plants accumulated
   more starch and fewer soluble sugars than both wild-type and bam3 plants
   during the day. Moreover, bam1 mutants were impaired in proline
   accumulation and suffered from stronger lipid peroxidation, compared
   with both wild-type and bam3 plants. Taken together, these data strongly
   suggest that carbon skeletons deriving from BAM1 diurnal degradation of
   transitory starch support the biosynthesis of proline required to face
   the osmotic stress. We propose the transitory-starch/proline interplay
   as an interesting trait to be tackled by breeding technologies aimingto
   improve drought tolerance in relevant crops.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{283}},
Number = {{1822}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Cooperation and diversity abound in nature despite cooperators risking
   exploitation from defectors and superior competitors displacing weaker
   ones. Understanding the persistence of cooperation and diversity is
   therefore a major problem for evolutionary ecology, especially in the
   context of well-mixed populations, where the potential for exploitation
   and displacement is greatest. Here, we demonstrate that a `loner
   effect', described by economic game theorists, can maintain cooperation
   and diversity in real-world biological settings. We use mathematical
   models of public-good-producing bacteria to show that the presence of a
   loner strain, which produces an independent but relatively inefficient
   good, can lead to rock-paper-scissor dynamics, whereby cooperators
   outcompete loners, defectors outcompete cooperators and loners
   outcompete defectors. These model predictions are supported by our
   observations of evolutionary dynamics in well-mixed experimental
   communities of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We find that the
   coexistence of cooperators and defectors that produce and exploit,
   respectively, the iron-scavenging siderophore pyoverdine, is stabilized
   by the presence of loners with an independent iron-uptake mechanism. Our
   results establish the loner effect as a simple and general driver of
   cooperation and diversity in environments that would otherwise favour
   defection and the erosion of diversity.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{During leaf senescence or abiotic stress in Arabidopsis thaliana,
   STAYGREEN1 (SGR1) promotes chlorophyll (Chl) degradation, acting with
   Chl catabolic enzymes, but the mechanism regulating SGR1 transcription
   remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis
   senescence-associated NAC transcription factor NAC016 directly activates
   SGR1 transcription. Under senescence-promoting conditions, the
   expression of SGR1 was downregulated in nac016-1 mutants and upregulated
   in NAC016-overexpressing (NAC016-OX) plants. By yeast one-hybrid and
   chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that NAC016 directly
   binds to the SGR1 promoter, which contains the NAC016-specific binding
   motif (termed the NAC016BM). Furthermore, nac016-1 SGR1-OX plants showed
   an early leaf yellowing phenotype, similar to SGR1-OX plants, confirming
   that NAC016 directly activates SGR1 expression in the leaf senescence
   regulatory cascade. Although we found that NAC016 activates SGR1
   expression in senescing leaves, this transcriptional regulation is
   considerably weaker in maturing seeds; the seeds of sgr1-1 mutants (also
   known as nonyellowing1-1, nye1-1) stayed green, while the seeds of
   nac016-1 mutants turned from green to yellow normally. We also found
   that the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling-related transcription factor
   genes ABI5 and EEL and the ABA biosynthesis gene AAO3, which activate
   SGR1 expression directly or indirectly, were significantly downregulated
   in nac016-1 mutants and upregulated in NAC016-OX plants. However, the
   NAC016BM does not exist in their promoter regions, indicating that
   NAC016 may indirectly activate these ABA signaling and biosynthesis
   genes, probably by directly activating transcriptional cascades
   regulated by the NAC transcription factor NAP. The NAC016-mediated
   regulatory cascades of SGR1 and other Chl degradation-related genes are
   discussed.}},

   of losses, efficiencies, efficacy, and effectiveness (which is conceived
   as a kind of overall utility) in general and for the case of phosphorus.
   We show how the material technical and economic value-related
   definitions are linked and can be utilized for sustainable phosphorus
   and resource management. Part 1 provides an overview of global
   anthropogenic and natural phosphorus flows and identifies major losses
   from the current phosphorus supply-demand chain. We discuss in what way
   the concepts of efficacy, efficiency, and effectiveness are related and
   how they may be used for assessing aspects of sustainable management. We
   discuss losses in mining and consider how management of the mining rate,
   cut-off grade, and stripping ratio might affect losses today and in the
   future. Although we identify critical losses of the supply-demand chain,
   the back sections of the paper focuses on losses in mining and
   beneficiation. When introducing different types of losses, we illuminate
   whether the residues in mining should be perceived as losses and whether
   mining companies can increase the total resource efficiency by
   decreasing the cut-off grade (i.e., by decreasing the concentration of
   phosphate ore that becomes subject to mining and beneficiation). This is
   discussed from an intergenerational justice and external costs
   perspective of losses. We introduce a classification system for (i)
   highly probable or definite absolute losses, (ii) losses from the
   supply-demand chain that become deferred losses, and (iii) uncertain
   losses that may become subject to sustainable resource management. This
   classification may be applied to all nodes of the supply-demand chain.
   We elaborate on how these types of losses can become subject to
   sustainable resource management. Part 2 of the paper discusses various
   operationalizations, fallacies, and challenges related to applying
   different efficiency terms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The wheat gene Lr34 encodes an ABCG-type transporter which provides
   durable resistance against multiple pathogens. Lr34 is functional as a
   transgene in barley, but its mode of action has remained largely unknown
   both in wheat and barley. Here we studied gene expression in uninfected
   barley lines transgenic for Lr34. Genes from multiple defense pathways
   contributing to basal and inducible disease resistance were
   constitutively active in seedlings and mature leaves. In addition, the
   hormones jasmonic acid and salicylic acid were induced to high levels,
   and increased levels of lignin as well as hordatines were observed.
   These results demonstrate a strong, constitutive re-programming of
   metabolism by Lr34. The resistant Lr34 allele (Lr34res) encodes a
   protein that differs by two amino acid polymorphisms from the
   susceptible Lr34sus allele. The deletion of a single phenylalanine
   residue in Lr34sus was sufficient to induce the characteristic
   Lr34-based responses. Combination of Lr34res and Lr34sus in the same
   plant resulted in a reduction of Lr34res expression by 8- to 20-fold
   when the low-expressing Lr34res line BG8 was used as a parent. Crosses
   with the high-expressing Lr34res line BG9 resulted in an increase of
   Lr34sus expression by 13- to 16-fold in progenies that inherited both
   alleles. These results indicate an interaction of the two Lr34 alleles
   on the transcriptional level. Reduction of Lr34res expression in BG8
   crosses reduced the negative pleiotropic effects of Lr34res on barley
   growth and vigor without compromising disease resistance, suggesting
   that transgenic combination of Lr34res and Lr34sus can result in
   agronomically useful resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Mutual learning is a fundamental element in transdisciplinary (Td)
   sustainability research. It allows for integrating knowledge and
   experiences gained in different contexts, including the building of
   consensus about necessary transformations to reach sustainability
   solutions. To successfully achieve mutual learning, appropriate
   conditions are required. These range from providing boundary objects
   that serve knowledge integration, the development of a common language
   and knowledge, and shared experiences to transparency concerning the
   objectives and motives of all those involved. Mutual learning is
   particularly challenging from an intercultural perspective in both local
   and global processes. Interaction among the participants is based on
   experiential, educational, and cultural dimensions that induce different
   types of knowledge and cognition, thought styles, socializations,
   constraints and preferences in socio-political structures and day-to-day
   practices. In this article, formats of case-based Mutual Learning
   Sessions (cbMLS) that organize mutual learning based on a single case or
   a set of cases are presented. The different formats have been developed
   and studied in the context of a global Td process on phosphorus
   management (i.e., the Global TraPs project). After presenting the
   formats of cbMLS, the paper presents the first results from an
   empirical, integrated qualitative study based on interviews and
   observations, and discusses potentials and limitations of cbMLS, in
   particular their application in an international context. We further
   highlight challenges and learning experiences that have to be met in Td
   mutual learning processes.}},

Title = {{The effects of foundation species on community assembly: a global study

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2064-2069}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Foundation species can change plant community structure by modulating
   important ecological processes such as community assembly, yet this
   topic is poorly understood. In alpine systems, cushion plants commonly
   act as foundation species by ameliorating local conditions. Here, we
   analyze diversity patterns of species' assembly within cushions and in
   adjacent surrounding open substrates (83 sites across five continents)
   calculating floristic dissimilarity between replicate plots, and using
   linear models to analyze relationships between microhabitats and species
   diversity. Floristic dissimilarity did not change across biogeographic
   regions, but was consistently lower in the cushions than in the open
   microhabitat. Cushion plants appear to enable recruitment of many
   relatively stress-intolerant species that otherwise would not establish
   in these communities, yet the niche space constructed by cushion plants
   supports a more homogeneous composition of species than the niche space
   beyond the cushion's influence. As a result, cushion plants support
   higher alpha-diversity and a larger species pool, but harbor assemblies
   with lower beta-diversity than open microhabitats. We conclude that
   habitats with and without dominant foundation species can strongly
   differ in the processes that drive species recruitment, and thus the
   relationship between local and regional species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Among saproxylic beetles, many early colonizers prefer particular host
   species. Ranking of preferred hosts of local saproxylic beetle
   communities is critical for effective dead-wood management in forests,
   but is rarely done because experiments with numerous tree species are
   labour and cost intensive. We analysed the host preference of local
   saproxylic beetle communities on logs of 13 tree species in relation to
   management (unmanaged and managed beech stands, conifer plantations on
   natural beech sites) in three regions of Germany during the most
   critical period for host specificity, that is the first two years after
   harvesting. Hosts were ranked quantitatively based on the ordinal
   ranking of hosts by single beetle species, which in turn was based on
   the variation in beetle abundance. First, we employed a Bradley-Terry
   model in which ranking was derived from paired comparisons of host
   trees. Then, a model-based recursive partitioning of the Bradley-Terry
   model tested whether host preference of beetle communities is affected
   by stand management, region and decay progress of dead wood. Our results
   indicated that beetle communities overall avoided logs of Fraxinus,
   Pseudotsuga, Larix and Tilia, and Carpinus ranked highest in preference.
   Carpinus also ranked highest for communities of broadleaf specialists;
   Picea abies ranked highest for communities of conifer specialists.
   Model-based recursive partitioning revealed that ranking of local hosts
   in conifer stands differed from that of broadleaf stands, and that
   ranking of hosts in broadleaf stands differed between regions, but only
   in the first year for both.Synthesis and applications. Early-colonizing
   saproxylic beetle communities vary locally in their choice of host
   trees. Therefore, forest managers should focus on the enrichment of dead
   wood of regional tree species and tree species of the local stand to
   successfully promote early-colonizing beetle.

Abstract = {{Holocene stromatolites characterized by unusually positive inorganic
   C-13(PDB) values (i.e. up to +16 parts per thousand) are present in
   Lagoa Salgada, a seasonally brackish to hypersaline lagoon near Rio de
   Janeiro (Brazil). Such positive values cannot be explained by
   phototrophic fixation of CO2 alone, and they suggest that methanogenesis
   was a dominating process during the growth of the stromatolites. Indeed,
   up to 5mm methane was measured in the porewater. The archaeal membrane
   lipid archaeol showing C-13 values between -15 and 0 parts per thousand
   suggests that archaea are present and producing methane in the modern
   lagoon sediment. Moreover, C-13-depleted hopanoids diplopterol and
   3-methylated C-32 17(H),21(H)-hopanoic acid (both -40 parts per
   thousand) are preserved in lagoon sediments and are most likely derived
   from aerobic methanotrophic bacteria thriving in the methane-enriched
   water column. Loss of isotopically light methane through the water
   column would explain the residual C-13-enriched pool of dissolved
   inorganic carbon from where the carbonate constituting the stromatolites
   precipitated. The predominance of methanogenic archaea in the lagoon is
   most likely a result of sulphate limitation, suppressing the activity of
   sulphate-reducing bacteria under brackish conditions in a seasonally
   humid tropical environment. Indeed, sulphate-reduction activity is very
   low in the modern sediments. In absence of an efficient
   carbonate-inducing metabolic process, we propose that stromatolite
   formation in Lagoa Salgada was abiotically induced, while the
   C-13-enriched organic and inorganic carbon pools are due to
   methanogenesis. Unusually, C-13-enriched stromatolitic deposits also
   appear in the geological record of prolonged periods in the Palaeo- and
   Neoproterozoic. Lagoa Salgada represents a possible modern analogue to
   conditions that may have been widespread in the Proterozoic, at times
   when low sulphate concentrations in sea water allowed methanogens to
   prevail over sulphate-reducing bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorophyllase (CLH) is a common plant enzyme that catalyzes the
   hydrolysis of chlorophyll to form chlorophyllide, a more hydrophilic
   derivative. For more than a century, the biological role of CLH has been
   controversial, although this enzyme has been often considered to
   catalyze chlorophyll catabolism during stress-induced chlorophyll
   breakdown. In this study, we found that the absence of CLH does not
   affect chlorophyll breakdown in intact leaf tissue in the absence or the
   presence of methyljasmonate, which is known to enhance stress-induced
   chlorophyll breakdown. Fractionation of cellular membranes shows that
   Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CLH is located in the endoplasmic
   reticulum and the tonoplast of intact plant cells. These results
   indicate that CLH is not involved in endogenous chlorophyll catabolism.
   Instead, we found that CLH promotes chlorophyllide formation upon
   disruption of leaf cells, or when it is artificially mistargeted to the
   chloroplast. These results indicate that CLH is responsible for
   chlorophyllide formation after the collapse of cells, which led us to
   hypothesize that chlorophyllide formation might be a process of defense
   against chewing herbivores. We found that Arabidopsis leaves with
   genetically enhanced CLH activity exhibit toxicity when fed to
   Spodoptera litura larvae, an insect herbivore. In addition, purified
   chlorophyllide partially suppresses the growth of the larvae. Taken
   together, these results support the presence of a unique binary defense
   system against insect herbivores involving chlorophyll and CLH.
   Potential mechanisms of chlorophyllide action for defense are discussed.}},

Title = {{Black Sea beaches vulnerability to sea level rise}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{95-109}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) aims to promote sustainable
   management of coastal zones based on ecosystem and holistic management
   approaches. In this context, policies have to consider the complex
   interactions that influence the fragile equilibrium of coastal
   ecosystems. Beaches represent both valuable and vulnerable natural
   resources because of the various ecosystem services they provide and
   their sensitivity to climate change and sea level rise.
   We present the first comprehensive digital record of all Black Sea
   beaches and provide a rapid assessment of their erosion risk under
   different scenarios of sea level rise. Through the digitisation of
   freely available remote-sensed images on the web, we provide broad
   information on the spatial characteristics and other attributes of all
   Black Sea beaches (e.g. photo-based visual estimation of the sediment
   type, presence of coastal defences, urban development). These data have
   been assembled and stored in full Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)
   allowing spatial queries, visualisation and data sharing and are
   therefore particularly interesting to feed/supply web-GIS portals
   (coastal atlases) for visualisation purpose, spatial queries or spatial
   indicators calculations.
   The resulting Black Sea beaches database contains 1228 beaches, with a
   total coastline length of 2042 km with an area of 224 km(2). The
   majority of the Black Sea beaches have been found to have small widths
   (61\% have maximum widths less than 50 m), whereas 47\% of all beaches
   presented coastal defence schemes, suggesting an already serious beach
   erosion problem.
   The erosion risk of the Black Sea beaches was assessed through the
   comparison of their maximum widths with estimations of the sea level
   rise-induced retreat by an ensemble of six 1-D analytical and numerical
   morphodynamic models. Following more than 17,000 experiments using
   different combinations of wave conditions, beach sediment textures and
   slopes and 11 scenarios of sea level rise (up to 2 m), the means (best
   fats) of the lowest and highest projections by the model ensemble were
   estimated; these were then compared to the maximum widths of the Black
   Sea beaches. The analysis showed that sea level rise will have highly
   significant impacts on the Black Sea beaches, as for a 0.5 m sea level
   rise 56\% of all beaches are projected to retreat by 50\% of their
   maximum width. For a 0.82 m sea level rise (the high IPCC estimate for
   the period 2081-2100) about 41\% are projected to retreat by their
   entire maximum width, whereas for 1 m sea level rise about 51\% of all
   Black Sea beaches are projected to retreat by (drowned or shifted
   landward by) their entire maximum width, if the high mean of the model
   ensemble projections is used.
   Results substantiate the risk of beach erosion as a major environmental
   problem along the Black Sea coast, which therefore needs to be taken
   into account in any future coastal management plans, as a matter of
   urgency. As these scenarios consider only sea level rise, they are
   considered to be conservative. Although the present results cannot
   replace detailed studies, the database and projections may assist Black
   Sea coastal managers and policy makers to rapidly identify beaches with
   increased risk of erosion, valuate accordingly coastal assets and
   infrastructure, estimate beach capacity for touristic development
   purposes, and rapidly assess direct and indirect costs and benefits of
   beach protection options. They also provide the necessary inputs to
   advance discussions relevant to the Black Sea ICZM. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{411-426}},
Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of land surface processes are important in order
   to perform landscape-scale assessments of earth systems. This task is
   problematic in complex terrain due to (i) high-resolution grids required
   to capture strong lateral variability, and (ii) lack of meteorological
   forcing data where they are required. In this study we test a topography
   and climate processor, which is designed for use with large-area land
   surface simulation, in complex and remote terrain. The scheme is driven
   entirely by globally available data sets. We simulate air temperature,
   ground surface temperature and snow depth and test the model with a
   large network of measurements in the Swiss Alps. We obtain
   root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values of 0.64 degrees C for air
   temperature, 0.67-1.34 degrees C for non-bedrock ground surface
   temperature, and 44.5 mm for snow depth, which is likely affected by
   poor input precipitation field. Due to this we trial a simple winter
   precipitation correction method based on melt dates of the snowpack. We
   present a test application of the scheme in the context of simulating
   mountain permafrost. The scheme produces a permafrost estimate of 2000
   km(2), which compares well to published estimates. We suggest that this
   scheme represents a useful step in application of numerical models over
   large areas in heterogeneous terrain.}},

Abstract = {{Resolving the spatial and temporal dynamics of gross primary
   productivity (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems across different scales
   remains a challenge. Remote sensing is regarded as the solution to
   upscale point observations conducted at the ecosystem level, using the
   eddy covariance (EC) technique, to the landscape and global levels. In
   addition to traditional vegetation indices, the photochemical
   reflectance index (PRI) and the emission of solar-induced chlorophyll
   fluorescence (SIF), now measurable from space, provide a new range of
   opportunities to monitor the global carbon cycle using remote sensing.
   However, the scale mismatch between EC observations and the much coarser
   satellite-derived data complicate the integration of the two sources of
   data. The solution is to establish a network of in situ spectral
   measurements that can act as a bridge between EC measurements and
   remote-sensing data. In situ spectral measurements have already been
   conducted for many years at EC sites, but using variable
   instrumentation, setups, and measurement standards. In Europe in
   particular, in situ spectral measurements remain highly heterogeneous.
   The goal of EUROSPEC Cost Action ES0930 was to promote the development
   of common measuring protocols and new instruments towards establishing
   best practices and standardization of these measurements. In this review
   we describe the background and main tradeoffs of in situ spectral
   measurements, review the main results of EUROSPEC Cost Action, and
   discuss the future challenges and opportunities of in situ spectral
   measurements for improved estimation of local and global estimates of
   GPP over terrestrial ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Angiosperm resurrection plants exhibit poikilo- or homoiochlorophylly as
   a response to water deficit. Both strategies are generally considered as
   effective mechanisms to reduce oxidative stress associated with
   photosynthetic activity under water deficiency. The mechanism of water
   deficit-induced chlorophyll (Chl) degradation in resurrection plants is
   unknown but has previously been suggested to occur as a result of
   non-enzymatic photooxidation. We investigated Chl degradation during
   dehydration in both poikilochlorophyllous (Xerophyta viscosa) and
   homoiochlorophyllous (Craterostigma pumilum) species. We demonstrate an
   increase in the abundance of PHEOPHORBIDE a OXYGENASE (PAO), a key
   enzyme of Chl breakdown, together with an accumulation of phyllobilins,
   that is, products of PAO-dependent Chl breakdown, in both species.
   Phyllobilins and PAO levels diminished again in leaves from rehydrated
   plants. We conclude that water deficit-induced poikilochlorophylly
   occurs via the well-characterized PAO/phyllobilin pathway of Chl
   breakdown and that this mechanism also appears conserved in a
   resurrection species displaying homoiochlorophylly. The roles of the
   PAO/phyllobilin pathway during different plant developmental processes
   that involve Chl breakdown, such as leaf senescence and desiccation,
   fruit ripening and seed maturation, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article attempts to disentangle the determinants of the adoption of
   renewable energy support policies in developing and emerging countries.
   By analyzing policies already implemented in industrialized countries,
   we focus on the diffusion but not the invention of climate-relevant
   policies. We look at four different types of policies (renewable energy
   targets, feed-in tariffs, other financial incentives and framework
   policies) and consider both domestic factors and international diffusion
   mechanisms utilizing a discrete-time events history model with a logit
   link on a self-compiled dataset of grid-based electricity policy
   adoption in 112 developing and emerging countries from 1998 to 2009. In
   general, we find stronger support for the domestic determinants of
   policy adoption, but also substantial influence of international
   factors. Countries with a larger population and more wealth have a
   higher probability of adopting renewable energy policies. Only in some
   specific cases do natural endowments for producing renewable energy
   encourage governments to adopt policies, and hydro power resources even
   correlate negatively with the adoption of targets. Among the
   international determinants, emulation from colonial peers and membership
   within the EU seem to facilitate policy adoption. International climate
   finance is less relevant, as the Global Environmental Facility and the
   Clean Development Mechanism may only increase the adoption of frameworks
   and targets, but they have no influence on tariffs and incentives. (C)

Abstract = {{Theory predicts the emergence of generalists in variable environments
   and antagonistic pleiotropy to favour specialists in constant
   environments, but empirical data seldom support such
   generalist-specialist trade-offs. We selected for generalists and
   specialists in the dung fly Sepsis punctum (Diptera: Sepsidae) under
   conditions that we predicted would reveal antagonistic pleiotropy and
   multivariate trade-offs underlying thermal reaction norms for juvenile
   development. We performed replicated laboratory evolution using four
   treatments: adaptation at a hot (31 degrees C) or a cold (15 degrees C)
   temperature, or under regimes fluctuating between these temperatures,
   either within or between generations. After 20 generations, we assessed
   parental effects and genetic responses of thermal reaction norms for
   three correlated life-history traits: size at maturity, juvenile growth
   rate and juvenile survival. We find evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy
   for performance at hot and cold temperatures, and a temperature-mediated
   trade-off between juvenile survival and size at maturity, suggesting
   that trade-offs associated with environmental tolerance can arise via
   intensified evolutionary compromises between genetically correlated
   traits. However, despite this antagonistic pleiotropy, we found no
   support for the evolution of increased thermal tolerance breadth at the
   expense of reduced maximal performance, suggesting low genetic variance
   in the generalist-specialist dimension.}},

Abstract = {{Topographic indices like the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) have been
   used to predict spatial patterns of average groundwater levels and to
   model the dynamics of the saturated zone during events (e. g.,
   TOPMODEL). However, the assumptions underlying the use of the TWI in
   hydrological models, of which the most important is that groundwater
   level variation can be approximated by a series of steady state
   situations, are rarely tested. It is also not clear how well findings
   from existing hillslope studies on sites with transmissive soil can be
   transferred to entire catchments with less permeable soils. This study,
   therefore, evaluated the suitability of selected topographic indices to
   describe spatial groundwater level variations based on time series from
   51 groundwater wells in a 20 ha catchment with low-permeability soils in
   Switzerland. Results showed that median groundwater levels were
   correlated to slope, curvature, and TWI, but the strength of correlation
   depended on whether the indices characterized the local topography or
   the topography of the upslope contributing area. The correlation between
   TWI and groundwater levels was not constant over time but decreased at
   the beginning of rainfall events, indicating large spatial differences
   in groundwater responses, and increased after peak flow, when
   groundwater levels could be considered to be spatially in a steady
   state. Our findings indicate that topographic indices are useful to
   predict median groundwater levels in catchments with low-permeability
   soils and that the TWI assumptions are best met when groundwater levels
   change slowly.}},

Abstract = {{Acanthostega is one of the earliest and most primitive limbed
   vertebrates. Its numerous fish-like features indicate a primarily
   aquatic lifestyle, yet cranial suture morphology suggests that its skull
   is more similar to those of terrestrial taxa. Here, we apply geometric
   morphometrics and two-dimensional finite-element analysis to the lower
   jaws of Acanthostega and 22 other tetrapodomorph taxa in order to
   quantify morphological and functional changes across the fish-tetrapod
   transition. The jaw of Acanthostega is similar to that of certain
   tetrapodomorph fish and transitional Devonian taxa both morphologically
   (as indicated by its proximity to those taxa in morphospace) and
   functionally (as indicated by the distribution of stress values and
   relative magnitude of bite force). Our results suggest a slow tempo of
   morphological and biomechanical changes in the transition from Devonian
   tetrapod jaws to aquatic/semi-aquatic Carboniferous tetrapod jaws. We
   conclude that Acanthostega retained a primitively aquatic lifestyle and
   did not possess cranial adaptations for terrestrial feeding.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most common trends in plant evolution, loss of
   self-incompatibility and ensuing increases in selfing, is generally
   assumed to be associated with a suite of phenotypic changes, notably a
   reduction of floral size, termed the selfing syndrome. We investigate
   whether floral morphological traits indeed decrease in a deterministic
   fashion after losses of self-incompatibility, as traditionally expected,
   using a phylogeny of 124 primrose species containing nine independent
   transitions from heterostyly (heteromorphic incompatibility) to
   homostyly (monomorphic self-compatibility), a classic system for
   evolution of selfing. We find similar overall variability of homostylous
   and heterostylous species, except for diminished herkogamy in
   homostyles. Bayesian mixed models demonstrate differences between
   homostylous and heterostylous species in all traits, but net effects
   across species are small (except herkogamy) and directionality differs
   among traits. Strongly drift-like evolutionary trajectories of corolla
   tube length and corolla diameter inferred by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models
   contrast with expected deterministic trajectories toward small floral
   size. Lineage-specific population genetic effects associated with
   evolution of selfing may explain that reductions of floral size
   represent one of several possible outcomes of floral evolution after
   loss of heterostyly in primroses. Contrary to the traditional paradigm,
   selfing syndromes may, but do not necessarily evolve in response to
   increased selfing.}},

Abstract = {{Egg components are important mediators of prenatal maternal effects in
   birds and other oviparous species. Because different egg components can
   have opposite effects on offspring phenotype, selection is expected to
   favour their mutual adjustment, resulting in a significant covariation
   between egg components within and/or among clutches. Here we tested for
   such correlations between maternally derived yolk immunoglobulins and
   yolk androgens in great tit (Parus major) eggs using a multivariate
   mixed-model approach. We found no association between yolk
   immunoglobulins and yolk androgens within clutches, indicating that
   within clutches the two egg components are deposited independently.
   Across clutches, however, there was a significant negative relationship
   between yolk immunoglobulins and yolk androgens, suggesting that
   selection has co-adjusted their deposition. Furthermore, an experimental
   manipulation of ectoparasite load affected patterns of covariance among
   egg components. Yolk immunoglobulins are known to play an important role
   in nestling immune defence shortly after hatching, whereas yolk
   androgens, although having growth-enhancing effects under many
   environmental conditions, can be immunosuppressive. We therefore
   speculate that variation in the risk of parasitism may play an important
   role in shaping optimal egg composition and may lead to the observed
   pattern of yolk immunoglobulin and yolk androgen deposition across
   clutches. More generally, our case study exemplifies how multivariate
   mixed-model methodology presents a flexible tool to not only quantify,
   but also test patterns of (co)variation across different organisational
   levels and environments, allowing for powerful hypothesis testing in
   ecophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{Precise information about the size and spatial distribution of glaciers
   is needed for many research applications, for example water resources
   evaluation, determination of glacier specific changes in area and
   volume, and for calculation of the past and future contribution of
   glaciers to sea-level change. However, mapping glacier outlines is
   challenging even under optimal conditions due to time consuming manual
   corrections of wrongly classified pixels. In the last decades,
   advantages in computer technologies have led to the development of
   object-based-image analysis (OBIA), an image classification technique
   that can be seen as an alternative to the common pixel-based image
   analysis (PBIA). In this study we compare the performance of OBIA with
   PBIA for glacier mapping in three test regions with challenging mapping
   conditions. In both approaches, a ratio image was created to map clean
   snow and ice while thermal and slope information was used to assist in
   the identification of debris-covered ice. The mapping results of OBIA
   have overall a similar to 3\% higher quality than PBIA, in particular in
   the processing of debris-covered glaciers where OBIA has a 12\% higher
   accuracy. The post-processing possibilities in OBIA (e. g., the
   application of a processing loop and neighborhood analysis) are
   especially powerful to improve the final classification. This leads also
   to a reduction of the workload for the manual corrections, which are
   still required to achieve a sufficient accuracy.}},

Title = {{DIVERSIFICATION OF C-4 GRASSES (POACEAE) DOES NOT COINCIDE WITH THEIR

Volume = {{101}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: The radiation of a lineage and its rise to
   ecological dominance are distinct phenomena and driven by different
   processes. For example, paleoecological data has been used to show that
   the Cretaceous angiosperm radiation did not coincide with their rise to
   dominance. Using a phylogenetic approach, we here explored the evolution
   of C-4 grasses and evaluated whether the diversification of this group
   and its rise to ecological dominance in the late Miocene were decoupled.
   Methods: We assembled a matrix including 675 grass species of the PACMAD
   clade and 2784 characters (ITS and ndhF) to run a molecular dating
   analysis using three fossils as reference calibrations. We coded species
   as C-3 vs. C-4 and reconstructed ancestral states under maximum
   likelihood. We used the program BiSSE to test whether rates of
   diversification are correlated with photosynthetic pathway and whether
   the radiation of C-4 lineages preceded or coincided with their rise to
   ecological dominance from similar to 10 Ma.
   Key results: C-4 grass lineages first originated around 35 Ma at the
   time of the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Accelerated diversification of
   C-4 lineages did not coincide with their rise to ecological dominance.
   Conclusions: C-4-dominated grasslands have expanded only since the Late
   Miocene and Pliocene. The initial diversification of their biotic
   elements can be tracked back as far as the Eocene-Oligocene transition.
   We suggest that shifts in taxonomic diversification and ecological
   dominance were stimulated by different factors, as in the case of the
   early angiosperms in the Cretaceous.}},

Abstract = {{Bryophyllum pinnatum is a succulent perennial plant native to Madagascar
   which is used in anthroposophical medicine to treat psychiatric
   disorders and as a tocolytic agent to prevent premature labour. We
   performed a metabolite profiling study in order to obtain a

   identify chromatographic markers for quality control and safety
   assessment of medicinal preparations. Preliminary HPLC-PDA-ESIMS
   analyses revealed that flavonoid glycosides were the main UV-absorbing
   constituents in the MeOH extract of B. pinnatum. Two phenolic
   glucosides, syringic acid -D-glucopyranosyl ester (1) and
   4-O--D-glucopyranosyl-cis-p-coumaric acid (2), as well as nine
   flavonoids (3-11) including kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, acacetin,
   and diosmetin glycosides were unambiguously identified by H-1 and 2DNMR
   analysis after isolation from a MeOH extract. The flavonol glycosides
   quercetin 3-O--L-arabinopyranosyl-(12)--L-rhamnopyranoside
   7-O--D-glucopyranoside (3) and myricetin
   3-O--L-arabinopyranosyl-(12)--L-rhamnopyranoside (4) were new natural

Abstract = {{It is widely acknowledged that private finance has a key role to play in
   achieving low-carbon development and resilience to climate change.
   However, while there have been several studies that have closely
   examined the data on public climate finance, there have been few such
   studies of the private climate-related finance data. There is a
   political dimension to accounting for private finance' given the
   commitment of industrialized countries - enshrined in the Copenhagen
   Accord and the Cancun Agreements - to mobilize US\$100 billion of public
   and private finance for developing countries by 2020, on an annual
   basis. The availability and quality of data for different types of
   private climate finance flows with climate benefits (investments, carbon
   market payments, and voluntary funding) are analysed, and these flows
   are assessed according to various criteria for inclusion in the \$100
   billion figure. While existing data suggest that private climate finance
   invested in developing countries and mobilized by industrialized
   countries might currently be in the range of \$27-123 billion per year,
   this number is a questionable point of reference. Existing data are
   limited and of very poor quality: definitions of private climate
   finance' are missing and data are hardly verified. Therefore, policy
   makers will first have to clearly define private climate finance' and
   develop systems for measuring, reporting, and verifying it, before using
   private finance numbers in international climate agreements.}},

Abstract = {{Starch is a water-insoluble, Glc-based biopolymer that is used for
   energy storage and is synthesized and degraded in a diurnal manner in
   plant leaves. Reversible phosphorylation is the only known natural
   starch modification and is required for starch degradation in planta.
   Critical to starch energy release is the activity of glucan
   phosphatases; however, the structural basis of dephosphorylation by
   glucan phosphatases is unknown. Here, we describe the structure of the
   Arabidopsis thaliana starch glucan phosphatase LIKE SEX FOUR2 (LSF2)
   both with and without phospho-glucan product bound at 2.3 angstrom and
   1.65 angstrom, respectively. LSF2 binds maltohexaose-phosphate using an
   aromatic channel within an extended phosphatase active site and
   positions maltohexaose in a C3-specific orientation, which we show is
   critical for the specific glucan phosphatase activity of LSF2 toward
   native Arabidopsis starch. However, unlike other starch binding enzymes,
   LSF2 does not possess a carbohydrate binding module domain. Instead we
   identify two additional glucan binding sites located within the core
   LSF2 phosphatase domain. This structure is the first of a glucan-bound
   glucan phosphatase and provides new insights into the molecular basis of
   this agriculturally and industrially relevant enzyme family as well as
   the unique mechanism of LSF2 catalysis, substrate specificity, and
   interaction with starch granules.}},

Abstract = {{Specialized trophic interactions in plantherbivoreparasitoid food webs
   can spur bottomup diversification if speciation in plants leads to
   host-shift driven divergence in insect herbivores, and if the effect
   then cascades up to the third trophic level. Conversely, parasitoids
   that search for victims on certain plant taxa may trigger topdown
   diversification by pushing herbivores into enemy-free space on novel
   hosts. We used phylogenetic regression methods to compare the relative
   importance of ecology versus phylogeny on associations between
   Heterarthrinae leafmining sawflies and their parasitoids. We found that:
   (1) the origin of leafmining led to escape from most parasitoids
   attacking external-feeding sawflies; (2) the current enemies mainly
   consist of generalists that are shared with other leafmining taxa, and
   of more specialized lineages that may have diversified by shifting among
   heterarthrines; and (3) parasitoidleafminer associations are influenced
   more by the phylogeny of the miners' host plants than by relationships
   among miner species. Our results suggest that vertical diversifying
   forces have a significantbut not ubiquitousrole in speciation: many of
   the parasitoids have remained polyphagous despite niche diversification
   in the miners, and heterarthrine host shifts also seem to be strongly
   affected by host availability.}},

Abstract = {{In most mammals, females pay for reproduction by dramatically increasing
   net energy intake from conception to mid- or late lactation. To do this,
   they time their reproductive events in relation to environmental cycles
   so that periods of peak food availability coincide with peak demand or
   are used to build energy stores. This timing is not possible in species
   with slow development in which lactation is prolonged over a multi-year
   period with fluctuating food availability. Here, mothers are expected to
   sustain a stable but generally lower level of nutrient transfer. In a
   sample of over 1,050 complete follow days of eight mother-infant pairs
   collected over 7 years, we document maternal effort for wild Bornean
   orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) over their average 6.5-year
   lactation period. As predicted, maternal feeding time was independent of
   the age of her growing offspring, indicating a stable sustained
   ``plateau{''} effort of a parts per thousand currency sign 25 \% above
   baseline level, instead of a short peak lactation as seen in seasonal
   breeders. Infant orangutans started to regularly supplement milk with
   self-harvested food when they were 1-1.5 years old, indicating milk
   intake was insufficient from this age onwards, even though maternal
   effort did not decrease. We expect the same regulation of sustained
   maternal effort in other large and large-brained mammals with slow
   infant development. We also predict that mother-infant conflict over
   suckling may show another peak at the onset of the milk + solid food
   phase, in addition to the well-known conflict around the endpoint of
   lactation (weaning), which is reached after a long and gradual increase
   in solid food intake by the infant.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a new algorithm for binary snow cover monitoring
   based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite
   images at 250 m resolution is validated using snow cover maps (SCA)
   based on Landsat 7 ETM+ images and in situ snow depth measurements from
   ground stations in selected test sites in Central Europe. The advantages
   of the proposed algorithm are the improved ground resolution of 250 m
   and the near real-time availability with respect to the 500 m standard
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) MODIS snow products
   (MOD10 and MYD10). It allows a more accurate snow cover monitoring at a
   local scale, especially in mountainous areas characterized by large
   landscape heterogeneity. The near real-time delivery makes the product
   valuable as input for hydrological models, e. g., for flood forecast. A
   comparison to sixteen snow cover maps derived from Landsat ETM/ETM+
   showed an overall accuracy of 88.1\%, which increases to 93.6\% in areas
   outside of forests. A comparison of the SCA derived from the proposed
   algorithm with standard MODIS products, MYD10 and MOD10, indicates an
   agreement of around 85.4\% with major discrepancies in forested areas.
   The validation of MODIS snow cover maps with 148 in situ snow depth
   measurements shows an accuracy ranging from 94\% to around 82\%, where
   the lowest accuracies is found in very rugged terrain restricted to in
   situ stations along north facing slopes, which lie in shadow in winter
   during the early morning acquisition.}},

Volume = {{243}},
Number = {{6, SI}},

Abstract = {{This review presents the role of strigolactone transport in regulating
   plant root and shoot architecture, plant-fungal symbiosis and the
   crosstalk with several phytohormone pathways. The authors, based on
   their data and recently published results, suggest that long-distance,
   as well local strigolactone transport might occur in a cell-to-cell
   manner rather than via the xylem stream.
   Strigolactones (SLs) are recently characterized carotenoid-derived
   phytohormones. They play multiple roles in plant architecture and, once
   exuded from roots to soil, in plant-rhizosphere interactions. Above
   ground SLs regulate plant developmental processes, such as lateral bud
   outgrowth, internode elongation and stem secondary growth. Below ground,
   SLs are involved in lateral root initiation, main root elongation and
   the establishment of the plant-fungal symbiosis known as mycorrhiza.
   Much has been discovered on players and patterns of SL biosynthesis and
   signaling and shown to be largely conserved among different plant
   species, however little is known about SL distribution in plants and its
   transport from the root to the soil. At present, the only characterized
   SL transporters are the ABCG protein PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE 1 from
   Petunia axillaris (PDR1) and, in less detail, its close homologue from
   Nicotiana tabacum PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE 6 (PDR6). PDR1 is a plasma
   membrane-localized SL cellular exporter, expressed in root cortex and
   shoot axils. Its expression level is regulated by its own substrate, but
   also by the phytohormone auxin, soil nutrient conditions (mainly
   phosphate availability) and mycorrhization levels. Hence, PDR1
   integrates information from nutrient availability and hormonal
   signaling, thus synchronizing plant growth with nutrient uptake. In this
   review we discuss the effects of PDR1 de-regulation on plant development
   and mycorrhization, the possible cross-talk between SLs and other
   phytohormone transporters and finally the need for SL transporters in
   different plant species.}},

Abstract = {{AimTo provide a mechanistic and probabilistic framework for defining the
   species pool based on species-specific probabilities of dispersal,
   environmental suitability and biotic interactions within a specific
   temporal extent, and to show how probabilistic species pools can help
   disentangle the geographical structure of different community assembly
   processes.
   InnovationProbabilistic species pools provide an improved species pool
   definition based on probabilities in conjunction with the associated
   species list, which explicitly recognize the indeterminate nature of
   species pool membership for a given focal unit of interest and better
   capture real-world complexity. Probabilistic species pools provide a
   quantitative assessment of how dispersal, environmental or biotic
   factors influence estimates of species pool composition and size for a
   given temporal extent.
   ConclusionsBased on one simulated and two empirical examples we
   demonstrate that probabilistic species pools allow us to disentangle the
   geographical variation in dispersal, environmental and biotic assembly
   processes for species assemblages in focal units. We also show that
   probabilistic species pools are fully compatible with traditional
   definitions of species pools and are applicable over a wide range of
   spatial and temporal extents. Additionally they are robust to missing
   data and provide a quantified and transparent approach to estimating the
   size and composition of species pools in a mechanistic way, providing a
   valuable tool for studies from community ecology to macroecology.}},

Abstract = {{A new high resolution biozonation based on the Unitary Association (UA)
   method is constructed for the Dienerian ammonoid succession of the
   Northern Indian Margin. It includes 12 UA-zones and leads to the
   subdivision of the Dienerian into three parts (early, middle and late).
   The corresponding diversity analyses, coupled with results previously
   obtained for the early Smithian ammonoids of the same regions, highlight
   the four following phases: (1) a first modest peak of diversity in the
   early Dienerian; (2) a very low diversity persisting throughout the
   middle Dienerian; (3) a slow increase of diversity during the late
   Dienerian, and (4) a marked diversification in the early Smithian.
   Turnover rates are very high during this entire time interval, and the
   boundaries between early-middle and middle-late Dienerian are emphasised
   by complete renewals of the ammonoid faunas. The low diversity values in
   the middle and early late Dienerian are concomitant with an anoxic event
   on outer continental shelves and coincide with warmer temperatures than
   those of the early Dienerian and early Smithian. This diversity pattern
   stands in strong contrast with the credo of a protracted or stepwise
   recovery following the end-Permian mass extinction. Together with the
   end-Smithian extinction, the middle and early late Dienerian diversity
   crises were likely both radical setbacks in the recovery of Early
   Triassic ammonoids. However, these two diversity crises do not
   necessarily imply identical environmental triggers that ultimately led
   to anoxic bottom waters on outer continental platforms in both cases.

Abstract = {{Estimation of survival rates is important for developing and evaluating
   conservation options for large carnivores. However, telemetry studies
   for large carnivores are often characterized by small sample sizes that
   limit meaningful conclusions. We used data from 10 published and 8
   unpublished studies of leopards Panthera pardus in southern Africa to
   estimate survival rates and investigate causes of leopard mortality.
   Mean survival rates were significantly lower in non-protected (0.55 +/-
   SE 0.08) compared to protected areas (0.88 +/- 0.03). Inside protected
   areas juveniles had significantly lower survival (0.39 +/- 0.10)
   compared to subadults (0.86 +/- 0.07) and adults (0.88 +/- 0.04). There
   was a greater difference in cause of death between protected and
   non-protected areas for females compared to males, with people being the
   dominant cause of mortality outside protected areas for both females and
   males. We suggest there is cause for concern regarding the
   sustainability of leopard populations in South Africa, as high female
   mortality may have severe demographic effects and a large proportion of
   suitable leopard habitat lies in non-protected areas. However, because a
   large proportion of deaths outside protected areas were attributed to
   deliberate killing by people, we suggest that management interventions
   may have the potential to increase leopard survival dramatically. We
   therefore stress the urgency to initiate actions, such as conflict
   mitigation programmes, to increase leopard survival in non-protected
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{While functional diversity (FD) has been shown to be positively related
   to a number of ecosystem functions including biomass production, it may
   have a much less pronounced effect than that of environmental factors or
   species-specific properties. Leaf and wood traits can be considered
   particularly relevant to tree growth, as they reflect a trade-off
   between resources invested into growth and persistence. Our study
   focussed on the degree to which early forest growth was driven by FD,
   the environment (11 variables characterizing abiotic habitat
   conditions), and community-weighted mean (CWM) values of species traits
   in the context of a large-scale tree diversity experiment (BEF-China).
   Growth rates of trees with respect to crown diameter were aggregated
   across 231 plots (hosting between one and 23 tree species) and related
   to environmental variables, FD, and CWM, the latter two of which were
   based on 41 plant functional traits. The effects of each of the three
   predictor groups were analyzed separately by mixed model optimization
   and jointly by variance partitioning. Numerous single traits predicted
   plot-level tree growth, both in the models based on CWMs and FD, but
   none of the environmental variables was able to predict tree growth. In
   the best models, environment and FD explained only 4 and 31\% of
   variation in crown growth rates, respectively, while CWM trait values
   explained 42\%. In total, the best models accounted for 51\% of crown
   growth. The marginal role of the selected environmental variables was
   unexpected, given the high topographic heterogeneity and large size of
   the experiment, as was the significant impact of FD, demonstrating that
   positive diversity effects already occur during the early stages in tree
   plantations.}},

Volume = {{282}},

Abstract = {{Female multiple mating (polyandry) is widespread across many animal taxa
   and indirect genetic benefits are a major evolutionary force favouring
   polyandry. An incentive for polyandry arises when multiple mating leads
   to sperm competition that disadvantages sperm from genetically inferior
   mates. A reduction in genetic quality is associated with costly selfish
   genetic elements (SGEs), and studies in invertebrates have shown that
   males bearing sex ratio distorting SGEs are worse sperm competitors than
   wild-type males. We used a vertebrate model species to test whether
   females can avoid an autosomal SGE, the t haplotype, through polyandry.
   The t haplotype in house mice exhibits strong drive in t heterozygous
   males by affecting spermatogenesis and is associated with homozygous in
   utero lethality. We used controlled matings to test the effect of the t
   haplotype on sperm competitiveness. Regardless of mating order, t
   heterozygous males sired only 11\% of zygotes when competing against
   wild-type males, suggesting a very strong effect of the t haplotype on
   sperm quality. We provide, to our knowledge, the first substantial
   evidence that polyandry ameliorates the harmful effects of an autosomal
   SGE arising through genetic incompatibility. We discuss potential
   mechanisms in our study species and the broader implications for the
   benefits of polyandry.}},

Abstract = {{DNA damage repair is an essential cellular mechanism that maintains
   genome stability. Here, we show that the nonmethylable cytidine analog
   zebularine induces a DNA damage response in Arabidopsis thaliana,
   independent of changes in DNA methylation. In contrast to genotoxic
   agents that induce damage in a cell cycle stage-independent manner,
   zebularine induces damage specifically during strand synthesis in DNA
   replication. The signaling of this damage is mediated by additive
   activity of ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED AND RAD3-RELATED and ATAXIA
   TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED kinases, which cause postreplicative cell cycle
   arrest and increased endoreplication. The repair requires a functional
   STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE OF CHROMOSOMES5 (SMC5)-SMC6 complex and is
   accomplished predominantly by synthesis-dependent strand-annealing
   homologous recombination. Here, we provide insight into the response
   mechanism for coping with the genotoxic effects of zebularine and
   identify several components of the zebularine-induced DNA damage repair
   pathway.}},

Title = {{Paleoceanographic changes during the Albian-Cenomanian in the Tethys and

Abstract = {{During the mid-Cretaceous the Earth was characterized by peculiar
   climatic and oceanographic features, such as very high temperatures,
   smooth thermal meridional gradient, long-term rising sea level, and
   formation of oceanic gateways and seaways. At that time widespread
   deposition of micritic pelagic limestones, generally called chalk,
   occurred in deep pelagic settings as well as in epeiric seas, both at
   tropical and at high latitudes. The origin of such extensive chalk
   deposition in the mid-Cretaceous is a complex and still controversial
   issue, which involves the interaction of several different factors. In
   this work we address this topic from the paleoceanographic perspective,
   by investigating the contribution of major oceanic circulation changes.
   We characterize several stratigraphic sections from the Tethys and North
   Atlantic with litho-, bio-, and carbon isotope stratigraphy. Our data
   show a change between two different oceanic circulation modes happening
   in the Late Albian. The first is an unstable mode, with oceanographic
   conditions fluctuating frequently in response to rapid environmental and
   climatic changes, such as those driven by orbital forcing. The second
   mode is more stable, with better connection between the different
   oceanic basins, a more stable thermocline, more persistent current flow,
   better defined upwelling and downwelling areas, and a more balanced
   oceanic carbon reservoir. We propose that under the mid-Cretaceous
   paleogeographic and paleodimatic conditions this change in oceanic

Abstract = {{Although animated images are very popular on the internet, they have so
   far found only limited use for glaciological applications. With long
   time series of satellite images becoming increasingly available and
   glaciers being well recognized for their rapid changes and variable flow
   dynamics, animated sequences of multiple satellite images reveal glacier
   dynamics in a time-lapse mode, making the otherwise slow changes of
   glacier movement visible and understandable to the wider public. For
   this study, animated image sequences were created for four regions in
   the central Karakoram mountain range over a 25-year time period
   (1990-2015) from freely available image quick-looks of orthorectified
   Landsat scenes. The animations play automatically in a web browser and
   reveal highly complex patterns of glacier flow and surge dynamics that
   are difficult to obtain by other methods. In contrast to other regions,
   surging glaciers in the Karakoram are often small (10 km(2) or less),
   steep, debris-free, and advance for several years to decades at
   relatively low annual rates (about 100ma(-1)). These characteristics
   overlap with those of non-surge-type glaciers, making a clear
   identification difficult. However, as in other regions, the surging
   glaciers in the central Karakoram also show sudden increases of flow
   velocity and mass waves travelling down glacier. The surges of
   individual glaciers are generally out of phase, indicating a limited
   climatic control on their dynamics. On the other hand, nearly all other
   glaciers in the region are either stable or slightly advancing,
   indicating balanced or even positive mass budgets over the past few
   decades.}},

Abstract = {{Public goods cooperation is common in microbes, and there is much
   interest in understanding how such traits evolve. Research in recent
   years has identified several important factors that shape the
   evolutionary dynamics of such systems, yet few studies have investigated
   scenarios involving interactions between multiple public goods. Here, we
   offer general predictions about the evolutionary trajectories of two
   public goods traits having positive, negative or neutral regulatory
   influence on one another's expression, and we report on a test of some
   of our predictions in the context of Pseudomonas aeruginosa's production
   of two interlinked iron-scavenging siderophores. First, we confirmed
   that both pyoverdine and pyochelin siderophores do operate as public
   goods under appropriate environmental conditions. We then tracked their
   production in lines experimentally evolved under different
   iron-limitation regimes known to favour different siderophore expression
   profiles. Under strong iron limitation, where pyoverdine represses
   pyochelin, we saw a decline in pyoverdine and a concomitant increase in
   pyochelin - consistent with expansion of pyoverdine-defective cheats
   derepressed for pyochelin. Under moderate iron limitation, pyochelin
   declined - again consistent with an expected cheat invasion scenario -
   but there was no concomitant shift in pyoverdine because
   cross-suppression between the traits is unidirectional only. Alternating
   exposure to strong and moderate iron limitation caused qualitatively
   similar though lesser shifts compared to the constant-environment
   regimes. Our results confirm that the regulatory interconnections
   between public goods traits can significantly modulate the course of
   evolution, yet also suggest how we can start to predict the impacts such
   complexities will have on phenotypic divergence and community stability.}},

Title = {{Arctic shrub effects on NDVI, summer albedo and soil shading}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{79-89}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The influence of Arctic vegetation on albedo, latent and sensible heat
   fluxes, and active layer thickness is a crucial link between boundary
   layer climate and permafrost in the context of climate change. Shrubs
   have been observed to lower the albedo as compared to lichen or
   graminoid-tundra. Despite its importance, the quantification of the
   effect of shrubification on summer albedo has not been addressed in much
   detail. We manipulated shrub density and height in an Arctic dwarf birch
   (Betula nana) shrub canopy to test the effect on shortwave radiative
   fluxes and on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a proxy
   for vegetation productivity used in satellite-based studies.
   Additionally, we parametrised and validated the 3D radiative transfer
   model DART to simulate the amount of solar radiation reflected and
   transmitted by an Arctic shrub canopy. We compared results of model runs
   of different complexities to measured data from North-East Siberia. We
   achieved comparably good results with simple turbid medium approaches,
   including both leaf and branch optical property media, and detailed
   object based model parameterisations. It was important to explicitly
   parameterise branches as they accounted for up to 71\% of the total
   canopy absorption and thus contributed significantly to soil shading.
   Increasing leaf biomass resulted in a significant increase of the NDVI,
   decrease of transmitted photosynthetically active radiation, and
   repartitioning of the absorption of shortwave radiation by the canopy
   components. However, experimental and modelling results show that canopy
   broadband nadir reflectance and albedo are not significantly decreasing
   with increasing shrub biomass. We conclude that the leaf to branch
   ratio, canopy background, and vegetation type replaced by shrubs need to
   be considered when predicting feedbacks of shrubification to summer
   albedo, permafrost thaw, and climate warming. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Although rapid phenotypic evolution during range expansion associated
   with colonization of contrasting habitats has been documented in several
   taxa, the evolutionary mechanisms that underlie such phenotypic
   divergence have less often been investigated. A strong candidate for
   rapid ecotype formation within an invaded range is the three-spine
   stickleback in the Lake Geneva region of central Europe. Since its
   introduction only about 140years ago, it has undergone a significant
   expansion of its range and its niche, now forming phenotypically
   differentiated parapatric ecotypes that occupy either the pelagic zone
   of the large lake or small inlet streams, respectively. By comparing
   museum collections from different times with contemporary population
   samples, we here reconstruct the evolution of parapatric phenotypic
   divergence through time. Using genetic data from modern samples, we
   infer the underlying invasion history. We find that parapatric
   habitat-dependent phenotypic divergence between the lake and stream was
   already present in the first half of the twentieth century, but the
   magnitude of differentiation increased through time, particularly in
   antipredator defence traits. This suggests that divergent selection
   between the habitats occurred and was stable through much of the time
   since colonization. Recently, increased phenotypic differentiation in
   antipredator defence traits likely results from habitat-dependent
   selection on alleles that arrived through introgression from a distantly
   related lineage from outside the Lake Geneva region. This illustrates
   how hybridization can quickly promote phenotypic divergence in a system
   where adaptation from standing genetic variation was constrained.}},

Journal = {{ECOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{930-938}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Senescence, the process of physiological deterioration associated with
   growing old, is a shared characteristic of a wide range of animals. Yet,
   lifespan varies dramatically among species. To explain this variation,
   the evolutionary theory of ageing has been proposed more than 50 yr ago.
   Although the theory has been tested experimentally and through
   comparative analyses, there remains debate whether its fundamental
   prediction is empirically supported. Here, we use a comprehensive
   database on avian life history traits to test the evolutionary theory of
   ageing at a global scale. We show that pronounced geographical gradients
   of maximum longevity exist, that they are predicted by measures of
   predator diversity and only partly depend on correlated life-history
   traits. The results are consistent with species-level analyses and can
   be replicated across bio-geographical regions. Our analyses suggest that
   stochastic predation is an important driver of the evolution of
   lifespan, at least in birds.}},

Abstract = {{To test whether camelids, as an artiodactyl family, are characterised by
   comparatively low energy expenditure, we collated literature data from
   experiments where at least one camelid and one ruminant species received
   the same diet, and literature data on camelid metabolism and energy
   requirements. Additionally, we measured the maintenance and resting
   metabolism in five alpacas, six llamas and five Bactrian camels by
   chamber respirometry. Irrespective of whether dry matter intake was
   expressed as g kg(-0.75) g kg(-0.9) day(-1), or g kg(-0.9) day(-1),
   camelids ingested significantly less food than domestic ruminants (data
   available for sheep and goats). Although metabolic rates and energy
   requirements reported for camelids vary over a large range, they are
   generally below the `average' basal mammal metabolism, and below
   published energy requirements for ruminants. The mean metabolic rates
   measured in this study were 215 +/- 68, 261 +/- 33 and 248 +/- 51 kJ

   +/- 38 and 192 +/- 48 kJ kg(-0.75) day(-1). These findings confirm that
   camelids in general are characterised by relatively low metabolism and
   food intake, which might explain why this previously diverse group is
   currently limited to arid environments with low food resources where a
   reduced metabolism represents an advantage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Smart technologies provide diverse and promising opportunities to reduce
   energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions; they are increasingly
   expected to shift modern societies' patterns of production and
   consumption towards sustainability. However, the existence of a
   theoretical potential does not imply that every smart solution
   (application of a smart technology) will contribute to sustainability.
   Policy-makers are therefore in need of methodologies to evaluate the
   sustainability of smart solutions. This paper gives an overview of the
   current discussion in the field and the emerging methodological
   challenges. The challenges of assessing the direct impact of the ICT
   components and infrastructures are special cases of known issues in life
   cycle assessment methodology. The challenges of assessing indirect
   impacts are inherently interdisciplinary and call for integrated
   modelling approaches. The last two sections provide an overview of the
   papers assembled in this thematic issue that treat specific cases and
   general principles of modeling and evaluating the sustainability of
   smart solutions. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims at improving the mapping of major mineral variability at
   regional scale using scale-dependent spatial variability observed in
   remote sensing data. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
   Radiometer (ASTER) data and statistical methods were combined with
   laboratory-based mineral characterization of field samples to create
   maps of the distributions of clay, mica and carbonate minerals and their
   abundances. The Material Identification and Characterization Algorithm
   (MICA) was used to identify the spectrally-dominant minerals in field
   samples; these results were combined with ASTER data using multinomial
   logistic regression to map mineral distributions. X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) was used to quantify mineral composition in field samples. XRD
   results were combined with ASTER data using multiple linear regression
   to map mineral abundances. We tested whether smoothing of the ASTER data
   to match the scale of variability of the target sample would improve
   model correlations. Smoothing was done with Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK) to
   represent the medium and long-range spatial variability in the ASTER
   data. Stronger correlations resulted using the smoothed data compared to
   results obtained with the original data. Highest model accuracies came
   from using both medium and long-range scaled ASTER data as input to the
   statistical models. High correlation coefficients were obtained for the
   abundances of calcite and mica (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.70, respectively).
   Moderately-high correlation coefficients were found for smectite and
   kaolinite (R-2 = 0.57 and 0.45, respectively). Maps of mineral
   distributions, obtained by relating ASTER data to MICA analysis of field
   samples, were found to characterize major soil mineral variability
   (overall accuracies for mica, smectite and kaolinite were 76\%, 89\% and
   86\% respectively). The results of this study suggest that the
   distributions of minerals and their abundances derived using
   FRK-smoothed ASTER data more closely match the spatial variability of
   soil and environmental properties at regional scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{89}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Caesalpinia sensu lato, in its broadest circumscription, is a
   pantropical group of c.150 species of trees, shrubs and lianas many of
   which grow in arid habitats of the Succulent Biome (sensu Schrire et
   al., 2005), and especially in the seasonally dry tropical forests of
   Central and South America and the Caribbean. As traditionally
   circumscribed, Caesalpinia s.l. was one of the largest genera in tribe
   Caesalpinieae, but seven generic segregates, namely Coulteria,
   Erythrostemon, Guilandina, Libidibia, Mezoneuron, Poincianella and Tara
   were reinstated by Lewis (2005), greatly reducing the number of species
   remaining in Caesalpinia sensu stricto. Nevertheless, doubts remain
   regarding the monophyly and delimitation of some of these segregate
   genera, which have not been thoroughly tested using molecular data, and
   this has hindered the establishment of a comprehensive generic
   classification of the broader Caesalpinia Group as a whole. Here we
   present a new phylogeny of the Caesalpinia Group, based on plastid rps16
   sequences and dense taxon sampling including 18 of the 21 genera of the
   Caesalpinia Group and 98 of the c.150 species of Caesalpinia s.l. Our
   results support the monophyly of five of the genera reinstated by Lewis,
   but the three other genera (including Caesalpinia s.s.) are
   non-monophyletic and need to be re-evaluated. Furthermore, three
   robustly supported newly discovered clades within Caesalpinia s.l.
   potentially merit recognition as distinct genera pending complete
   investigation of diagnostic morphological characters. Uncertainties
   concerning the delimitation of some clades are discussed especially in
   relation to the extensive morphological variation found within
   Caesalpinia s.l. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{122}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Canopy structural parameters are often used to give adequate
   representation of vegetated ecosystems for various purposes including
   primary productivity, climate system, water and carbon gas exchanges,
   and radiation extinction. Canopy structural parameters are usually
   described using several pseudo-synonymous terms, often measuring
   different components of vegetation canopies. Standardization in the
   definitions has fallen short, leading to confusion of terms even in
   standard text books making the comparison of historic measures futile.
   Here we clarify concepts that have been used for fractional canopy
   element cover and openness measures. The fractional canopy element cover
   and openness concepts considered are canopy closure, canopy cover,
   canopy openness, crown closure, crown completeness, crown cover, crown
   porosity, site openness and tilt openness. New methodologies are
   presented to obtain large scale fractional canopy element cover and
   openness measures using hemispherical photography. The new methodologies
   and variations in definitions of fractional canopy element cover and
   openness concepts are demonstrated using photographic measurements in
   complex topography. The results indicate that both fractional canopy
   element cover and openness parameters can be estimated with a few
   point-based measurements using hemispherical photography. Hemispherical
   photography is therefore less time, labour and resource intensive, as
   compared to point based measuring techniques of canopy element cover and
   openness. Most of the commonly and interchangeably used concepts of
   fractional canopy element cover and openness measures represent
   physically different structural properties of a vegetated ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The extinction of large herbivores, often keystone species, can
   dramatically modify plant communities and impose key biotic thresholds
   that may prevent an ecosystem returning to its previous state and
   threaten native biodiversity. A potentially innovative, yet
   controversial, landscape-based long-term restoration approach is to
   replace missing plant-herbivore interactions with non-native herbivores.
   Aldabran giant (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and Madagascan radiated
   (Astrochelys radiata) tortoises, taxonomically and functionally similar
   to the extinct Mauritian giant tortoises (Cylindraspis spp.), were
   introduced to Round Island, Mauritius, in 2007 to control the non-native
   plants that were threatening persistence of native species. We monitored
   the response of the plant community to tortoise grazing for 11 months in
   enclosures before the tortoises were released and, compared the cost of
   using tortoises as weeders with the cost of using manual labor. At the
   end of this period, plant biomass; vegetation height and cover; and
   adult, seedling, flower, and seed abundance were 3-136 times greater in
   adjacent control plots than in the tortoise enclosures. After their
   release, the free-roaming tortoises grazed on most non-native plants and
   significantly reduced vegetation cover, height, and seed production,
   reflecting findings from the enclosure study. The tortoises generally
   did not eat native species, although they consumed those native species
   that increased in abundance following the eradication of mammalian
   herbivores. Our results suggest that introduced non-native tortoises are
   a more cost-effective approach to control non-native vegetation than
   manual weeding. Numerous long-term outcomes (e.g., change in species
   composition and soil seed bank) are possible following tortoise
   releases. Monitoring and adaptive management are needed to ensure that
   the replacement herbivores promote the recovery of native plants.}},

Abstract = {{Veterinary pharmaceuticals excreted in the dung of treated livestock can
   have strong non-target effects on the dung organism community. We report
   results of ecotoxicological tests with ivermectin for 21 species of
   temperate (Europe, North America) and tropical (Asia, Central America)
   black scavenger flies (Diptera: Sepsidae), using standardized methods
   developed previously for the yellow dung fly and the face fly. Our study
   documents great variation in ivermectin sensitivity of more than two
   orders of magnitude among species and even populations within species:
   estimated lethal effect concentrations LC50 (at which 50\% of the flies
   died) ranged from 0.05 to 18.55 mu g/kg dung fresh weight (equivalent to
   0.33-132.22 mu g/kg dung dry weight). We also show that controlled
   laboratory tests can-within reasonable limits-be extended to the field
   or to laboratory settings without climate control, as obtained LC50 were
   roughly similar. In addition to lethal effects, our study revealed
   relevant sub-lethal effects at lower ivermectin concentrations in terms
   of prolonged development, smaller body size and reduced juvenile growth
   rate. Finally, oviposition choice experiments showed that females
   generally do not discriminate against dung containing ivermectin
   residues. We conclude that sepsid flies are well suited test organisms

Abstract = {{The ubiquitin-26S proteasome degradation system (UPS) in plants is
   involved in the signal transduction of many cellular processes,
   including host immune responses triggered by pathogen attack. Attacking
   pathogens produce effectors that are translocated into host cells, where
   they interfere with the host's defense signaling in very specific ways.
   Perhaps not surprising in view of the broad involvement of the host
   proteasome in plant immunity, certain bacterial effectors exploit or
   require the host UPS for their action, as currently best studied in
   Pseudomonas syringae. Intriguingly, some P. syringae strains also
   secrete the virulence factor syringolin A, which irreversibly inhibits
   the proteasome by a novel mechanism. Here, the role of the UPS in plant
   defense and its exploitation by effectors are summarized, and the
   biology, taxonomic distribution, and emerging implications for virulence
   strategies of syringolin A and similar compounds are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Although observations of species-rich communities have long served as a
   primary motivation for research on the coexistence of competitors, the
   majority of our empirical and theoretical understanding comes from
   two-species systems. How much of the coexistence observed in
   species-rich communities results from indirect effects among competitors
   that only emerge in diverse systems remains poorly understood. Resolving
   this issue requires simple, scalable, and intuitive metrics for
   quantifying the conditions for coexistence in multispecies systems, and
   how these conditions differ from those expected based solely on pairwise
   interactions. To achieve these aims, we develop a structural approach
   for studying the set of parameter values compatible with n-species
   coexistence given the geometric constraints imposed by the matrix of
   competition coefficients. We derive novel mathematical metrics analogous
   to stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences that measure
   the range of conditions compatible with multispecies coexistence,
   incorporating the effects of indirect interactions emerging in diverse
   systems. We show how our measures can be used to quantify the extent to
   which the conditions for coexistence in multispecies systems differ from
   those that allow pairwise coexistence, and apply the method to a field
   system of annual plants. We conclude by presenting new challenges and
   empirical opportunities emerging from our structural metrics of
   multispecies coexistence.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate three-dimensional information on canopy structure contributes
   to better understanding of radiation fluxes within the canopy and the
   physiological processes associated with them. Small-footprint airborne
   laser scanning (ALS) data proved valuable for characterising the
   three-dimensional structure of forest canopies and the retrieval of
   biophysical parameters such as plant and leaf area index (PAI and LAI),
   fractional cover or canopy layering. Nevertheless, few studies analysed
   combined occluded and observed canopy elements in dense vegetation as a
   result of airborne laser scanning geometries. The occluded space
   contains a substantial amount of vegetation elements (i.e. leaf, needle
   and wood material), which are missing in the analysis of the
   three-dimensional canopy structure. Consequently, this will lead to
   erroneous retrieval of biophysical parameters. In this study, we
   introduce a voxel traversal algorithm to characterise ALS observation
   patterns inside a voxel grid. We analyse the dependence of occluded and
   unobserved canopy volume on pulse density, flight strip overlap and
   season of overflight in a temperate mixed forest. ALS measurements under
   leaf-on and leaf-off conditions were used. For cross-comparison
   purposes, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measurements on a 50x50 m(2)
   subplot under leaf-on conditions were used. TLS acquisitions were able
   to depict the three-dimensional structure of the forest plot in high
   detail, ranging up to the top-most canopy layer.
   Our results at 1 m voxel size show that even with the highest average
   pulse density of 11 pulses/m(2), at least 25\% of the forest canopy
   volume remains occluded in the ALS acquisition under leaf-on conditions.
   Comparison with TLS acquisitions further showed that roughly 28\% of the
   vegetation elements detected by the TLS acquisitions were not detected
   by the ALS system due to occlusion effects. By combining leaf-on and
   leaf-off acquisitions, we were able to recover roughly 7\% of the
   occluded vegetation elements from the leaf-on acquisition. We find that
   larger flight strip overlap can significantly increase the amount of
   observed canopy volume due to the added observation angles and increased
   pulse density. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{1. Current approaches to conservation may be inadequate to maintain
   ecosystem integrity because they are mostly based on rarity status of
   organisms rather than functional significance. Alternatively, approaches
   focusing on the protection of ecological networks lead to more
   appropriate conservation targets to maintain ecosystem integrity.
   2. We propose that a shift in focus from species to interaction networks
   is necessary to achieve pressing conservation management and restoration
   ecology goals of conserving biodiversity, ecosystem processes and
   ultimately landscape-scale delivery of ecosystem services.
   3. Using topical examples from the literature, we discuss historical and
   conceptual advances, current challenges and ways to move forward. We
   also propose a road map to ecological network conservation, providing a
   novel ready to use approach to identify clear conservation targets with
   flexible data requirements.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Integration of how environmental and
   spatial constraints affect the nature and strength of local interaction
   networks will improve our ability to predict their response to change
   and to conserve them. This will better protect species, ecosystem
   processes, and the resulting ecosystem services we depend on.}},

Title = {{The origin of species richness patterns along environmental gradients:
   uniting explanations based on time, diversification rate and carrying

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aims Patterns of species richness, such as the remarkable biodiversity
   of tropical regions, have been documented and studied for centuries.
   However, their underlying evolutionary and ecological causes are still
   incompletely understood. A commonly stated paradigm in the literature is
   that high richness in some habitats is directly caused by one of three
   competing explanations: (1) greater time-for-speciation (earlier
   colonization), (2) more rapid diversification rates (faster speciation
   relative to extinction) or (3) higher carrying capacity. However, these
   three explanations have been relatively little studied using theoretical
   approaches (especially in terms of comparing all three). Furthermore,
   empirical studies give conflicting results about their relative
   importance. Here, we use simulations to study the processes that drive
   richness patterns along environmental gradients.
   Location Globally applicable.
   Methods We use individual-based and trait-based modelling of
   eco-evolutionary dynamics to simulate the evolutionary radiation of a
   clade across five habitats with differing ecological conditions, and
   track patterns of species richness within and between habitats over
   time. We specifically address the roles of time and diversification
   rates in explaining richness patterns and the potential impact of
   carrying capacity.
   Main results and conclusions Contrary to the widespread paradigm, we
   find that variation in carrying capacity can underlie differences in
   diversification rates and time-for-speciation among habitats. Therefore,
   carrying capacity is not a competing, alternative explanation for
   richness patterns. We also find that the time-for-speciation effect
   dominates richness patterns over short time-scales, whereas
   diversification rates dominate over longer time-scales. These latter
   observations can help reconcile the seemingly conflicting results of
   many empirical studies, which find that some patterns are explained by
   time and others by differences in diversification rates.}},

Abstract = {{To estimate drug consumption more reliably, waste water-based
   epidemiology would benefit from a better understanding of drug residue
   stability during in-sewer transport. We conducted batch experiments with
   real, fresh wastewater and sewer biofilms. Experimental conditions mimic
   small to medium-sized gravity sewers with a relevant ratio of biofilm
   surface area to wastewater volume (33 m(2) m(-3)). The influences of
   biological, chemical, and physical processes on the transformation of 30
   illicit drug and pharmaceutical residues were quantified. Rates varied
   among locations and over time. Three substances were not stable-that is,
   >20\% transformation, mainly due to biological processes-at least for
   one type of tested biofilm for a residence time <= 2 h: amphetamine,
   6-acetylcodeine, and 6-monoacetylmorphine. Cocaine, ecgonine methyl
   ester, norcocaine, cocaethylene, and mephedrone were mainly transformed
   by chemical hydrolysis and, hence, also unstable in sewers. In contrast,
   ketamine, norketamine, O-desmethyltramadol, diclofenac, carbamazepine,
   and methoxetamine were not substantially affected by in-sewer processes
   under all tested conditions and residence times up to 12 h. Our
   transformation rates include careful quantification of uncertainty and
   can be used to identify situations in which specific compounds are not
   stable. This will improve accuracy and uncertainty estimates of drug
   consumption when applied to the back calculation.}},

   fusion contest organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical
   Committee (IADF TC) of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society
   (IEEE GRSS). As for previous years, the IADF TC organized a data fusion
   contest aiming at fostering new ideas and solutions for multisource
   studies. The 2015 edition of the contest proposed a multiresolution and
   multisensorial challenge involving extremely high-resolution RGB images
   and a three-dimensional (3-D) LiDAR point cloud. The competition was
   framed in two parallel tracks, considering 2-D and 3-D products,
   respectively. In this paper, we discuss the scientific results obtained
   by the winners of the 2-D contest, which studied either the
   complementarity of RGB and LiDAR with deep neural networks (winning
   team) or provided a comprehensive benchmarking evaluation of new
   classification strategies for extremely high-resolution multimodal data
   (runner-up team). The data and the previously undisclosed ground truth
   will remain available for the community and can be obtained at

Abstract = {{Life cycle assessments (LCA) of an early research state reaction process
   only have laboratory experiments data available. While this is helpful
   in understanding the laboratory process from an environmental
   perspective, it gives only limited indication on the possible
   environmental impact of that same material or process at industrial
   production. Therefore, a comparative LCA study with materials that are
   already produced at industrial scales is not very meaningful. The
   scale-up of chemical processes is not such a trivial process and
   requires a certain understanding of the involved steps. In this paper,
   we elaborated a framework that helps to scale up chemical production
   processes for LCA studies when only data from laboratory experiments are
   available. Focusing on heated liquid phase batch reactions, we
   identified and simplified the most important calculations for the
   reaction step's energy use as well as for certain purification and
   isolation steps. For other LCA in- and output values, we provide
   estimations and important qualitative considerations to be able to
   perform such a scale-up study. Being an engineering-based approach
   mainly, it does not include systematically collected empirical data
   which would give a better picture about the uncertainty. However, it is
   a first approach to predict the environmental impact for certain
   chemical processes at an industrial production already during early
   laboratory research stage. It is designed to be used by LCA
   practitioners with limited knowledge in the field of chemistry or
   chemical engineering and help to perform such a scale-up based on a
   logical and systematic procedure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Passive detection of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) using
   spectroscopy has been proposed as a proxy to quantify changes in
   photochemical efficiency at canopy level under natural light conditions.
   In this study, we explored the use of imaging spectroscopy to quantify
   spatio-temporal dynamics of SW within crop canopies and its sensitivity
   to track patterns of photosynthetic activity originating from the
   interaction between vegetation structure and incoming radiation as well
   as variations in plant function. SIF was retrieved using the Fraunhofer
   Line Depth (FLD) principle from imaging spectroscopy data acquired at
   different time scales a few metres above several crop canopies growing
   under natural illumination. We report the first maps of canopy SIF in
   high spatial resolution. Changes of SW were monitored at different time
   scales ranging from quick variations under induced stress conditions to
   seasonal dynamics. Natural changes were primarily determined by varying
   levels and distribution of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR).
   However, this relationship changed throughout the day demonstrating an
   additional physiological component modulating spatio-temporal patterns
   of SIF emission. We successfully used detailed SW maps to track changes
   in the canopy's photochemical activity under field conditions, providing
   a new tool to evaluate complex patterns of photosynthesis within the
   canopy.}},

Title = {{Avirulence Genes in Cereal Powdery Mildews: The Gene-for-Gene Hypothesis
   2.0}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The gene-for-gene hypothesis states that for each gene controlling
   resistance in the host, there is a corresponding, specific gene
   controlling avirulence in the pathogen. Allelic series of the cereal
   mildew resistance genes Pm3 and Mia provide an excellent system for
   genetic and molecular analysis of resistance specificity. Despite this
   opportunity for molecular research, avirulence genes in mildews remain
   underexplored. Earlier work in barley powdery mildew (B.g, hordei) has
   shown that the reaction to some Mla resistance alleles is controlled by
   multiple genes. Similarly, several genes are involved in the specific
   interaction of wheat mildew (B.g. trifler) with the Pm3 allelic series.
   We found that two mildew genes control avirulence on Pm3f: one gene is
   involved in recognition by the resistance protein as demonstrated by
   functional studies in wheat and the heterologous host Nicotiana
   benthamiana. A second gene is a suppressor, and resistance is only
   observed in mildew genotypes combining the inactive suppressor and the
   recognized Avr. We propose that such suppressor/avirulence gene
   combinations provide the basis of specificity in mildews. Depending on
   the particular gene combinations in a mildew race, different genes will
   be genetically identified as the ``avirulence{''} gene. Additionally,
   the observation of two LINE retrotransposon-encoded avirulence genes in
   B.g, hordei further suggests that the control of avirulence in mildew is
   more complex than a canonical gene-for-gene interaction. To fully
   understand the mildew cereal interactions, more knowledge on avirulence
   determinants is needed and we propose ways how this can be achieved
   based on recent advances in the field.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{617-624}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Searching for mates is a critical stage in the life cycle of most
   internally, and many externally, fertilizing species. Males usually
   invest more in this costly activity than females, but the reasons for
   this are poorly understood. Previous models have shown that
   female-biased parental investment, including anisogamy, does not by
   itself select for male-biased mate searching, so it requires additional
   explanations. Here, we correct and expand upon earlier models, and
   present two novel hypotheses that might explain the evolution of
   male-biased mate searching. The ``carry-over hypothesis{''} states that
   females benefit less from searching if the associated costs affect other
   stages of the life cycle, rather than arising only while searching. It
   is relevant to the evolution of morphological traits that improve
   searching efficiency but are also expressed in other contexts. The
   ``mating window hypothesis{''} states that females benefit less from
   searching if their life cycle includes intervals during which the exact
   timing of mating does not matter for the appropriate timing of
   reproduction (e.g., due to sperm storage or delayed embryo
   implantation). Such intervals are more likely to exist for females given
   the general pattern of greater female parental investment. Our models
   shed new light on classic arguments about sex role evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The foundational concepts behind the persistence of ecological
   communities have been based on two ecological properties: dynamical
   stability and feasibility. The former is typically regarded as the
   capacity of a community to return to an original equilibrium state after
   a perturbation in species abundances and is usually linked to the
   strength of interspecific interactions. The latter is the capacity to
   sustain positive abundances on all its constituent species and is linked
   to both interspecific interactions and species demographic
   characteristics. Over the last 40years, theoretical research in ecology
   has emphasized the search for conditions leading to the dynamical
   stability of ecological communities, while the conditions leading to
   feasibility have been overlooked. However, thus far, we have no evidence
   of whether species interactions are more conditioned by the community's
   need to be stable or feasible. Here, we introduce novel quantitative
   methods and use empirical data to investigate the consequences of
   species interactions on the dynamical stability and feasibility of
   mutualistic communities. First, we demonstrate that the more nested the
   species interactions in a community are, the lower the mutualistic
   strength that the community can tolerate without losing dynamical
   stability. Second, we show that high feasibility in a community can be
   reached either with high mutualistic strength or with highly nested
   species interactions. Third, we find that during the assembly process of
   a seasonal pollinator community located at The Zackenberg Research
   Station (northeastern Greenland), a high feasibility is reached through
   the nested species interactions established between newcomer and
   resident species. Our findings imply that nested mutualistic communities
   promote feasibility over stability, which may suggest that the former
   can be key for community persistence.}},

Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Grasses, by their high productivity even under very low pCO(2), their
   ability to survive repeated burning and to tolerate long dry seasons,
   have transformed the terrestrial biomes in the Neogene and Quaternary.
   The expansion of grasslands at the cost of biodiverse forest biomes in
   Madagascar is often postulated as a consequence of the Holocene
   settlement of the island by humans. However, we show that the Malagasy
   grass flora has many indications of being ancient with a long local
   evolutionary history, much predating the Holocene arrival of humans.
   First, the level of endemism in the Madagascar grass flora is well above
   the global average for large islands. Second, a survey of many of the
   more diverse areas indicates that there is a very high spatial and
   ecological turnover in the grass flora, indicating a high degree of
   niche specialization. We also find some evidence that there are both
   recently disturbed and natural stable grasslands: phylogenetic community
   assembly indicates that recently severely disturbed grasslands are
   phylogenetically clustered, whereas more undisturbed grasslands tend to
   be phylogenetically more evenly distributed. From this evidence, it is
   likely that grass communities existed in Madagascar long before human
   arrival and so were determined by climate, natural grazing and other
   natural factors. Humans introduced zebu cattle farming and increased
   fire frequency, and may have triggered an expansion of the grasslands.
   Grasses probably played the same role in the modification of the
   Malagasy environments as elsewhere in the tropics.}},

   DNA-Based Detection of Macroinvertebrates}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{305-312}},
Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{Accurate detection of organisms is crucial for the effective management
   of threatened and invasive species because false detections directly
   affect the implementation of management actions. The use of
   environmental DNA (eDNA) as a species detection tool is in a rapid
   development stage; however, concerns about accurate detections using
   eDNA have been raised. We evaluated the effect of sampled water volume
   (0.25 to 2 L) on the detection rate for three macroinvertebrate species.
   Additionally, we tested (depending on the sampled water volume) what
   amount of total extracted DNA should be screened to reduce uncertainty
   in detections. We found that all three species were detected in all
   volumes of water. Surprisingly, however, only one species had a positive
   relationship between an increased sample volume and an increase in the
   detection rate. We conclude that the optimal sample volume might depend
   on the species habitat combination and should be tested for the system
   where management actions are warranted. Nevertheless, we minimally
   recommend sampling water volumes of 1 L and screening at least 14 mu L
   of extracted eDNA for each sample to reduce uncertainty in detections
   when studying macroinvertebrates in rivers and using our molecular
   workflow.}},

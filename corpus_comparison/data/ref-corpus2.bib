Abstract = {{Water resources in high mountains play a fundamental role for societies
   and ecosystems both locally and downstream. Impacts of global change,
   including climate change, glacier shrinkage, and socioeconomic forces
   related to demographics, agroindustrial development, and
   hydroelectricity generation; pose new hydrological risks for human
   livelihoods. However, these hydroclimatic and socioeconomic drivers of
   water resource change are often poorly quantified and interconnected,
   while data scarcity poses challenges in these regions. Here we review
   the state of knowledge for two major catchments in the Peruvian Andes,
   which hold the largest tropical glacier mass worldwide: the Santa River
   (Cordillera Blanca) and Vilcanota River (Cordillera Vilcanota). Our
   integrative review of water resource change and comparative discharge
   analysis of two gauging stations in the Santa and Vilcanota River
   catchments show that the future provision of water resources is a
   concern to regional societies and must be factored more carefully into
   water management policies. In this context, observed hydroclimatic and
   socioeconomic changes represent important drivers of water availability,
   allocation, and conflicts over water resources. The legal framework and
   decentralized institutional architecture in Peru could potentially
   provide a basis for participatory integrative water management; however,
   unequal power relations, institutional fragility and increasing
   competition over water resources hamper these efforts. We identify
   several research gaps, including the need for more in situ data,
   cultural analyses, and a risk-based framework that combines
   climate-related hazards with human and natural vulnerabilities. Finally,
   this review suggests that future adaptation plans for water management
   should better link science, society, and policy. (C) 2015 Wiley

Volume = {{186}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{50-58}},

Abstract = {{The recent description of potentially generic early warning signals is a
   promising development that may help conservationists to anticipate a
   population's collapse prior to its occurrence. So far, the majority of
   such warning signals documented have been in highly controlled
   laboratory systems or in theoretical models. Data from wild populations,
   however, are typically restricted both temporally and spatially due to
   limited monitoring resources and intrinsic ecological
   heterogeneity-limitations that may affect the detectability of generic
   early warning signals, as they add additional stochasticity to
   population abundance estimates. Consequently, spatial and temporal
   subsampling may serve to either muffle or magnify early warning signals.
   Using a combination of theoretical models and analysis of experimental
   data, we evaluate the extent to which statistical warning signs are
   robust to data corruption.}},

Abstract = {{Self-incompatibility (SI) systems in flowering plants distinguish self-
   and non-self pollen to prevent inbreeding. While other SI systems rely
   on the self- recognition between specific male- and female-determinants,
   the Solanaceae family has a non-self recognition system resulting in the
   detoxification of female-determinants of S-ribonucleases (S-RNases),
   expressed in pistils, by multiple male- determinants of S-locus F-box
   proteins (SLFs), expressed in pollen. It is not known how many SLF
   components of this non-self recognition system there are in Solanaceae
   species, or how they evolved. We identified 16-20 SLFs in each
   S-haplotype in SI Petunia, from a total of 168 SLF sequences using
   large-scale next-generation sequencing and genomic polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) techniques. We predicted the target S-RNases of SLFs by
   assuming that a particular S-allele must not have a conserved SLF that
   recognizes its own S-RNase, and validated these predictions by
   transformation experiments. A simple mathematical model confirmed that
   16-20 SLF sequences would be adequate to recognize the vast majority of
   target S-RNases. We found evidence of gene conversion events, which we
   suggest are essential to the constitution of a non-self recognition
   system and also contribute to self- compatible mutations.}},

Title = {{Female house mice avoid fertilization by t haplotype incompatible males

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{54-64}},

Abstract = {{The t haplotype in house mice is a well-known selfish genetic element
   with detrimental, nonadditive fitness consequences to its carriers:
   recessive lethal mutations cause t/t homozygotes to perish in utero.
   Given the severe genetic incompatibility imposed by the t haplotype, we
   predict females to avoid fertilization by t haplotype incompatible
   males. Indeed, some of the strongest evidence for compatibility mate
   choice is related to the t haplotype in house mice. However, all
   previous evidence for compatibility mate choice in this system is based
   on olfactory preference. It is so far unknown how general these
   preferences are and whether they are relevant in an actual mating
   context. Here, we assess female compatibility mate choice related to t
   haplotypes in a setting that - for the first time - allowed females to
   directly interact and mate with males. This approach enabled us to
   analyse female behaviour during the testing period, and the resulting
   paternity success and fitness consequences of a given choice. We show
   that genetic incompatibilities arising from the t haplotype had severe
   indirect fitness consequences and t females avoided fertilization by t
   incompatible males. The results are inconclusive whether this avoidance
   of t fertilization by t females was caused by pre- or post-copulatory
   processes.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{310-327}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Investigating how different evolutionary forces have shaped patterns of
   DNA variation within and among species requires detailed knowledge of
   their demographic history. Orang-utans, whose distribution is currently
   restricted to the South-East Asian islands of Borneo (Pongo pygmaeus)
   and Sumatra (Pongo abelii), have likely experienced a complex
   demographic history, influenced by recurrent changes in climate and sea
   levels, volcanic activities and anthropogenic pressures. Using the most
   extensive sample set of wild orang-utans to date, we employed an
   Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach to test the fit of 12
   different demographic scenarios to the observed patterns of variation in
   autosomal, X-chromosomal, mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal markers. In
   the best-fitting model, Sumatran orang-utans exhibit a deep split of
   populations north and south of Lake Toba, probably caused by multiple
   eruptions of the Toba volcano. In addition, we found signals for a
   strong decline in all Sumatran populations similar to 24ka, probably
   associated with hunting by human colonizers. In contrast, Bornean
   orang-utans experienced a severe bottleneck similar to 135ka, followed
   by a population expansion and substructuring starting similar to 82ka,
   which we link to an expansion from a glacial refugium. We showed that
   orang-utans went through drastic changes in population size and
   connectedness, caused by recurrent contraction and expansion of
   rainforest habitat during Pleistocene glaciations and probably hunting
   by early humans. Our findings emphasize the fact that important aspects
   of the evolutionary past of species with complex demographic histories
   might remain obscured when applying overly simplified models.}},

Title = {{Using imaging spectroscopy to predict above-ground plant biomass in

Abstract = {{AimsImaging spectroscopy enables measurement of vegetation optical
   properties to predict vegetation characteristics that are important for
   a wide range of ecological applications. Our aim was to predict fresh
   above-ground biomass of heterogeneous alpine grasslands in two areas and
   at two ecological scales. We assessed model plausibility for an
   intensively studied alpine grassland site (plant community scale) having
   distinct biomass and ungulate grazing patterns.
   LocationAlpine grasslands in the Swiss National Park.
   MethodsBiomass data were collected in 51 plots and combined with imaging
   spectroscopy data to establish simple ratio models. We analysed the
   predictive power and transferability of models developed in two areas
   (Val Trupchun, Il Fuorn) and at two ecological scales (regional, local).
   In a next step, we compared our results to the broadband normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI). Finally, we assessed the
   correlations between model predictions and plant biomass distribution at
   the plant community scale.
   ResultsThe best local simple ratio models yielded a model fit of
   R-2=0.60 and R-2=0.30, respectively, the best regional model a fit of
   R-2=0.44. NDVI model performance was weaker for the regional and one
   local area, but slightly better for the other local area. However, at
   the plant community scale only the local model showed a significant
   positive correlation (R-S=0.39) with the known biomass distribution.
   Further, predictive power decreased when models were transferred from
   one local area to another or from one ecological scale to another.
   ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that imaging spectroscopy is generally
   useful to predict above-ground plant biomass in alpine grasslands with
   distinct grazing patterns. Site-specific local models based on simple
   ratio indices performed better than the NDVI or regional models,
   suggesting that standardized approaches might not be adequate,
   particularly in heterogeneous grasslands inhabited by large ungulates.
   We emphasize the importance of collecting ground reference data covering
   the expected range of productivity and plant species composition.
   Moreover, plant community-scale data from a previous study proved to be
   extremely valuable to test model plausibility.}},

Abstract = {{The bryophytes are a morphologically and ecologically diverse group of
   plants that have recently emerged as major model systems for a variety
   of biological processes. In particular, the genome sequence of the moss,
   Physcomitrella patens, has significantly enhanced our understanding of
   the evolution of developmental processes in land plants. However, to
   fully explore the diversity within bryophytes, we need additional
   genomic resources. Here, we describe analyses of the transcriptomes of a
   male and a female isolate of the moss, Ceratodon purpureus, generated
   using the 454 FLX technology. Comparative analyses between C.purpureus
   and P.patens indicated that this strategy generated nearly complete
   coverage of the protonemal transcriptome. An analysis of the overlap in
   gene sets between C.purpureus and P.patens provides new insights into
   the evolution of gene family composition across the land plants. In
   spite of the overall transcriptomic similarity between the two species,
   K-a/K-s analysis of P.patens and C.purpureus suggests considerable
   physiological and developmental divergence. Additionally, while the
   codon usage was very similar between these two mosses, C.purpureus genes
   showed a slightly greater codon usage bias than P.patens genes
   potentially because of the contrasting mating system of the two species.
   Finally, we found evidence of a genome doubling similar to 65-76MYA that
   likely coincided with the contemporaneous polyploidy event inferred for
   P.patens but postdates the divergence of P.patens and C.purpureus. The
   powerful laboratory tools now available for C.purpureus will enable the
   research community to fully exploit these genomic resources.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) generated by airborne
   remote sensing are frequently used to analyze landform structures
   (monotemporal) and geomorphological processes (multitemporal) in remote
   areas or areas of extreme terrain. In order to assess and quantify such
   structures and processes it is necessary to know the absolute accuracy
   of the available DEMs. This study assesses the absolute vertical
   accuracy of DEMs generated by the High Resolution Stereo Camera-Airborne
   (HRSC-A), the Leica Airborne Digital Sensors 40/80 (ADS40 and ADS80) and
   the analogue camera system RC30. The study area is located in the
   Turtmann valley, Valais, Switzerland, a glacially and periglacially
   formed hanging valley stretching from 2400 m to 3300 m a.s.l. The
   photogrammetrically derived DEMs are evaluated against geodetic field
   measurements and an airborne laser scan (ALS). Traditional and robust
   global and local accuracy measurements are used to describe the vertical
   quality of the DEMs, which show a non Gaussian distribution of errors.
   The results show that all four sensor systems produce DEMs with similar
   accuracy despite their different setups and generations. The ADS40 and
   ADS80 (both with a ground sampling distance of 0.50 m) generate the most
   accurate DEMs in complex high mountain areas with a RMSE of 0.8 m and
   NMAD of 0.6 m They also show the highest accuracy relating to flying
   height (0.14\%0). The pushbroom scanning system HRSC-A produces a RMSE
   of 1.03 m and a NMAD of 0.83 m (0.21\%0 accuracy of the flying height
   and 10 times the ground sampling distance). The analogue camera system
   RC30 produces DEMs with a vertical accuracy of 1.30 m RMSE and 0.83 m
   NMAD (0.17\%0 accuracy of the flying height and two times the ground
   sampling distance). It is also shown that the performance of the DEMs
   strongly depends on the inclination of the terrain. The RMSE of areas up
   to an inclination <40 is better than 1 m. In more inclined areas the
   error and outlier occurrence increase for all DEMs. This study shows the
   level of detail to which airborne stereoscopically derived DEMs can
   reliably be used in high mountain environments. All four sensor systems
   perform similarly in flat terrain. 2014 International Society for

Abstract = {{Facilitative effects of some species on others are a major driver of
   biodiversity. These positive effects of a benefactor on its beneficiary
   can result in negative feedback effects of the beneficiary on the
   benefactor and reduced fitness of the benefactor. However, in contrast
   to the wealth of studies on facilitative effects in different
   environments, we know little about whether the feedback effects show
   predictable patterns of context dependence. We reanalyzed a global data
   set on alpine cushion plants, previously used to assess their positive
   effects on biodiversity and the nature of the beneficiary feedback
   effects, to specifically assess the context dependence of how small- and
   large-scale drivers alter the feedback effects of cushion-associated
   (beneficiary) species on their cushion benefactors using structural
   equation modelling. The effect of beneficiaries on cushions became
   negative when beneficiary diversity increased and facilitation was more
   intense. Local-scale biotic and climatic conditions mediated these
   community-scale processes, having indirect effects on the feedback
   effect. High-productivity sites demonstrated weaker negative feedback
   effects of beneficiaries on the benefactor. Our results indicate a
   limited impact of the beneficiary feedback effects on benefactor
   cushions, but strong context dependence. This context dependence may
   help to explain the ecological and evolutionary persistence of this
   widespread facilitative system.}},

Abstract = {{Humans form agonistic coalitions and alliances in many contexts, but
   this behavior is thought to be rare in other species. A prominent
   hypothesis states that coalitions may be under cognitive constraints,
   but this idea is debated and remains to be tested empirically. In this
   study, we evaluate the cognitive constraint hypothesis against 3
   alternative hypotheses that stress the role of demography, substrate
   use, and resource competition, for the evolution of male coalitions. A
   comparative analysis of a unique data set of 86 multimale multifemale
   groups of 38 nonhuman primate species from all major radiations revealed
   no evolutionary association of male coalition frequency with cognitive
   capacity (as indexed by neocortex ratio and endocranial volume). The
   observed variation was best explained by demography and resource
   competition in that male coalitions were more likely to occur in species
   characterized by larger male groups and reduced levels of contest
   competition (after controlling for phylogeny). These findings suggest
   that constraints imposed by the socioecological setting, rather than
   cognition, explain best why some primate species evolved customary
   coalitionary behavior while others did not. This study presents the
   first empirical evidence against the long-standing view that cognitive
   abilities may impose a limit on the use of coalitions in animals.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzed the extent to which root exudates diffuse from the
   root surface towards the soil depending on topsoil and subsoil
   properties and the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae on
   root-derived C distribution in the rhizosphere.
   Alfalfa was grown in three-compartment pots. Nylon gauze prevented
   either roots alone or roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae
   from penetrating into the rhizosphere compartments. (CO2)-C-14 pulse
   labeling enabled the measurement of C-14-labeled exudates in dissolved
   (DOC) and total organic carbon (TOC) in the rhizosphere, distributed
   either by diffusion alone or by diffusion, root hair and hyphal
   transport.
   Root exudation and microbial decomposition of exudates was higher in the
   rhizosphere with topsoil compared to subsoil properties. Exudates
   extended over 28 mm (DOC) and 20 mm (TOC). Different soil properties and
   mycorrhization, likely caused by the low arbuscular mycorrhizal
   colonization of roots (13 +/- 4 \% (topsoil properties) and 18 +/- 5 \%
   (subsoil properties)), had no effect.
   Higher microbial decomposition compensated for higher root exudation
   into the rhizosphere with topsoil properties, which resulted in equal
   exudate extent when compared to the rhizosphere with subsoil properties.
   Higher C-14 activity used for labeling compared with previous studies
   enabled the detection of low exudate concentrations at longer distances
   from the root surface.}},

Abstract = {{Climate is one of the most important drivers for adaptive evolution in
   forest trees. Climatic selection contributes greatly to local adaptation
   and intraspecific differentiation, but this kind of selection could also
   have promoted interspecific divergence through ecological speciation. To
   test this hypothesis, we examined intra-and interspecific genetic
   variation at 25 climate-related candidate genes and 12 reference loci in
   two closely related pine species, Pinus massoniana Lamb. and Pinus
   hwangshanensis Hisa, using population genetic and landscape genetic
   approaches. These two species occur in Southeast China but have
   contrasting ecological preferences in terms of several environmental
   variables, notably altitude, although hybrids form where their
   distributions overlap. One or more robust tests detected signals of
   recent and/or ancient selection at two-thirds (17) of the 25 candidate
   genes, at varying evolutionary timescales, but only three of the 12
   reference loci. The signals of recent selection were species specific,
   but signals of ancient selection were mostly shared by the two species
   likely because of the shared evolutionary history. F-ST outlier analysis
   identified six SNPs in five climate-related candidate genes under
   divergent selection between the two species. In addition, a total of 24
   candidate SNPs representing nine candidate genes showed significant
   correlation with altitudinal divergence in the two species based on the
   covariance matrix of population history derived from reference SNPs.
   Genetic differentiation between these two species was higher at the
   candidate genes than at the reference loci. Moreover, analysis using the
   isolation-with-migration model indicated that gene flow between the
   species has been more restricted for climate-related candidate genes
   than the reference loci, in both directions. Taken together, our results
   suggest that species-specific and divergent climatic selection at the
   candidate genes might have counteracted interspecific gene flow and
   played a key role in the ecological divergence of these two closely
   related pine species.}},

Abstract = {{Much attention has been paid to the effects of climate change on
   species' range reductions and extinctions. There is however surprisingly
   little information on how climate change driven threat may impact the
   tree of life and result in loss of phylogenetic diversity (PD). Some
   plant families and mammalian orders reveal nonrandom extinction
   patterns, but many other plant families do not. Do these discrepancies
   reflect different speciation histories and does climate induced
   extinction result in the same discrepancies among different groups?
   Answers to these questions require representative taxon sampling. Here,
   we combine phylogenetic analyses, species distribution modeling, and
   climate change projections on two of the largest plant families in the
   Cape Floristic Region (Proteaceae and Restionaceae), as well as the
   second most diverse mammalian order in Southern Africa (Chiroptera), and
   an herbivorous insect genus (Platypleura) in the family Cicadidae to
   answer this question. We model current and future species distributions
   to assess species threat levels over the next 70years, and then compare
   projected with random PD survival. Results for these animal and plant
   clades reveal congruence. PD losses are not significantly higher under
   predicted extinction than under random extinction simulations. So far
   the evidence suggests that focusing resources on climate threatened
   species alone may not result in disproportionate benefits for the
   preservation of evolutionary history.}},

Abstract = {{The omasum of pecoran ruminants (which is absent in tragulids) and
   shorter gestation periods in non-giraffid crown pecorans (as opposed to
   giraffids) could represent cases of key innovations that caused
   disparity in species diversity in extant ruminants. Literature suggests
   that the different ruminant groups inhabited similar niche spectra at
   different times, supporting the `increased fitness' interpretation where
   a key innovation does not mainly open new niches, but allows more
   efficient use of existing ones. In this respect, we explored data on
   fossil species diversity of Afro-Eurasian ruminants from the Neogene and
   Quaternary. Tragulid and giraffid diversity first increased during the
   Early/Middle Miocene with subsequent declines, whereas bovid and cervid
   diversity increased distinctively. Our resulting narrative, combining
   digestive physiology, life history and the fossil record, thus provides
   an explanation for the sequence of diversity patterns in Old-World

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{392-401}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Breeding vocalizations can provide up-to-date information about callers.
   During the rut, fallow buck calling rates vary in response to their
   nearest neighbors, and vocal fatigue is linked to body condition loss.
   We found that fallow bucks perceive higher calling rates as a greater
   threat and that bucks were sensitive to declines in the quality of the
   calls of other males. Over the breeding season, fallow bucks gain
   information from changing calls to continually assess the condition and
   motivation of conspecifics.Vocalizations encode a range of information
   about the caller, and variation in calling behavior and vocal structure
   may provide listeners with information about the motivation and
   condition of the caller. Fallow bucks only vocalize during the breeding
   season and can produce more than 3000 groans per hour. Males modulate
   their calling rates, calling faster when other calling males and/or
   females are nearby. Groans also reveal caller fatigue, becoming shorter
   and higher pitched toward the end of the rut. Thus, fallow deer groans
   vary both over very short (minute to minute) and longer timescales (the
   rut). However, no studies have investigated how intraindividual acoustic
   variation in fallow deer groans is perceived and how the information is
   utilized. Using playback experiments, we examined if fallow bucks can
   extract information about callers from groans and how groaning rate and
   fatigue affect the perceived competition posed by a caller. Males became
   attentive sooner and remained attentive for longer during high-rate
   playbacks than low-rate playbacks. Furthermore, males were attentive for
   longer during playback of early rut groans that are indicative of males
   in better condition. Over short timescales, fallow bucks gain
   information about the motivation of callers through groaning rates.
   While over longer timescales, males can detect declines in call quality,
   corresponding to the loss of condition in callers. Thus, over the course
   of the rut, fallow bucks can extract honest information from dynamic
   vocalizations to continually assess the current state of conspecifics.}},

Abstract = {{The important role of roots and rhizosphere processes is accepted for
   the top soil, but still under debate for the deep subsoil including soil
   parent material. Especially for terrestrial sediments like loess and
   dune sands, roots and root traces are mostly recognized in profile
   descriptions, but not interpreted in the paleoenvironmental context.
   Further, synchrony of sediment deposition and root trace formation is
   commonly assumed. This is challenged by partially large maximum rooting
   depths of plants, exceeding the soil depth, and by frequent occurrence
   of secondary carbonates and biopores of potential root origin below
   recent soil and paleosols. To improve understanding of
   paleoenvironmental records in terrestrial sediment-paleosol sequences,
   recent roots and root traces, including calcified roots and root-derived
   biopores, were investigated in six soil, loess and dune sand profiles
   across Central and SE Europe. Visualization of small carbonate
   accumulations (diameter <= 1mm), frequently called `pseudomycelia', by
   X-ray microtomographic scanning, and morphologic comparison with
   rhizoliths (calcified roots; diameter mostly 3-20 mm, up to 100 mm
   possible) indicate root origin of the former, therefore requiring
   renaming to microrhizoliths. Quantification of roots, biopores,
   rhizoliths and microrhizoliths on horizontal levels yielded maximum
   frequencies of 2100 m(-2), 4100 m(-2), 196 m(-2) and 12,800 m(-2),
   respectively. Considering the pore volume remaining from former root
   growth this indicates their significant contribution to structural
   properties of the sediments and paleosols. Depth distribution of roots
   and root traces was frequently related to soil and paleosols,
   respectively, and mostly showed maximum frequencies within or
   immediately below these units. Root traces are therefore not necessarily
   of similar age like the surrounding sediment, but are typically of
   younger age. The time lag between root traces and the surrounding
   stratigraphic unit can vary between small time periods (likely decades
   to centuries) in case of microrhizoliths and several millenia in case of
   larger rhizoliths penetrating several stratigraphic units. With assumed
   radii of former rhizosphere extension of 5 mm for microrhizoliths, a
   frequency of 12,500 m(-2) corresponded to 100\% rhizosphere area in the
   respective depth interval. These findings emphasize the meaning of root
   traces in sediment-paleosol sequences. Potential temporal and spatial
   inhomogeneity of root growth on the one hand, especially for shrub and
   tree vegetation, and occurrence of root remains of different age and
   origin in identical depth intervals on the other hand, hamper the
   assessment of the chronologic context of these with the surrounding
   sediment or paleosol. Nevertheless, root traces in terrestrial archives
   provide valuable information with respect to paleovegetation and
   paleoenvironmental conditions, if their chronological context is known.

Abstract = {{This article explores youth drinking in Zurich, Switzerland, on both
   public squares away from nightlife areas, referred to as square street
   drinking' and on the street within the vicinity of nightclubs, defined
   as club street drinking'. Taking a relational space approach, the
   analysis adds a social perspective to the dominant economic-political
   perspective to drinking in urban nightlife zones. The results suggest
   that the normative landscapes of drinking are constructed differently:
   the same regulation by police and social workers works differently
   between the two areas both in terms of inclusion and exclusion as well
   as in terms of how the material and social dimensions interact.
   Production and regulation are dependent on how young people participate
   in these processes. This finding suggests that it would be fruitful to
   develop a regulation approach on drinking in the post-industrial city
   that is sensitive to young people as co-producers of space.}},

Title = {{From text to landscape: locating, identifying and mapping the use of
   landscape features in a Swiss Alpine corpus}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{1272-1293}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate how a large corpus, consisting of about 10
   000 articles describing Swiss alpine landscapes and activities and
   dating back to 1864, can be used to explore the use of language in
   space. In a first step, we link landscape descriptions to geospatial
   footprints, which requires new methods to disambiguating toponyms
   referring to natural features. Secondly, we identify natural features
   used to describe landscapes, which are compared and discussed in the
   light of previous work based on controlled participant experiments in
   laboratory settings and more exploratory ethnographic studies. Finally,
   we use natural features in combination with geospatial footprints to
   investigate variations in landscape descriptions across space.
   Our contributions are threefold. Firstly, we show how a corpus composed
   of detailed descriptions of natural landscapes can be georeferenced and
   mapped using density surfaces and an adaptive grid linking footprints to
   articles. Secondly, 95 natural features are identified in the corpus,
   forming a vocabulary of terms reflecting known basic levels and their
   relationships to other more specific landscape features. Thirdly, we can
   explore the use of natural features in broader spatial and temporal
   contexts than is possible in typical ethnographic work, by exploring
   when and where particular terms are used within Switzerland with respect
   to our corpus. On the one hand, this enables us to characterize
   individual regions and, on the other hand, to measure similarity between
   regions, on the basis of associated natural features.
   Our methods could be adapted to different types of corpus, for instance,
   referring to fine granularity entities in urban landscapes. Our results
   are potential building blocks for attaching place-related descriptions
   to automatically generated sensor data such as photographs or satellite
   images.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{98-115}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Mammals display a broad spectrum of limb specializations coupled with
   different locomotor strategies and habitat occupation. This anatomical
   diversity reflects different patterns of development and growth,
   including the timing of epiphyseal growth plate closure in the long
   bones of the skeleton. We investigated the sequence of union in 15
   growth plates in the limbs of about 400 specimens, representing 58
   mammalian species: 34 placentals, 23 marsupials and one monotreme. We
   found a common general pattern of growth plate closure sequence, but one
   that is universal neither between species nor in higher-order taxa.
   Locomotor habitat has no detectable correlation with the growth plate
   closure sequence, but observed patterns indicate that growth plate
   closure sequence is determined more strongly through phylogenetic
   factors. For example, the girdle elements (acetabulum and coracoid
   process) always ossify first in marsupials, whereas the distal humerus
   is fused before the girdle elements in some placentals. We also found
   that heterochronic shifts (changes in timing) in the growth plate
   closure sequence of marsupials occur with a higher rate than in
   placentals. This presents a contrast with the more limited variation in
   timing and morphospace occupation typical for marsupial development.
   Moreover, unlike placentals, marsupials maintain many epiphyses
   separated throughout life. However, as complete union of all epiphyseal
   growth plates is recorded in monotremes, the marsupial condition might
   represent the derived state.}},

Abstract = {{Species diversity patterns are the product of diversification rate
   variation, but the factors influencing changes in diversification rates
   are poorly known. Radiation is thought to be the result of ecological
   opportunity: the right traits in the right environment at the right
   time. We test this in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa,
   in which pyrophytic heathland (fynbos) and non-pyrophytic Afromontane
   forest occur interdigitated. We infer transitions from forest to fynbos
   in three Cape clades (Penaeaceae, Phyliceae and Diosmeae) and test if
   they are associated with diversification rate shifts and the evolution
   of functional traits linked to fire, high insolation and seasonal
   drought. We estimate diversification rate shifts using maximum
   likelihood and use phylogenetic comparative methods to show that forest
   to fynbos shifts were associated with decreases in leaf area and
   specific leaf area and preceded or coincided with increases in
   diversification rates. Furthermore, we show that Penaeaceae, Phyliceae
   and Diosmeae species are typical members of their vegetation types in
   terms of their traits. The diversification rate shifts of Penaeaceae and
   Phyliceae are dated to the Miocene, when postulated aridification-driven
   changes in the CFR fire regimes may have triggered expansion of the
   fynbos at the cost of forest, providing an ecological opportunity for
   the diversification of fynbos lineages. (C) 2014 Geobotanisches Institut

Title = {{Field-based observations of regional-scale, temporal variation in net
   primary production in Tibetan alpine grasslands}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2003-2016}},
Abstract = {{Net primary production (NPP) is a fundamental process of natural
   ecosystems. Temporal variation of NPP not only reflects how communities
   respond to environmental fluctuations, but it also has important
   implications for regional carbon assessment. Unfortunately, studies
   based on field measurements to directly address this issue in the
   extreme environment of alpine grasslands are rare. In this study, we
   measured aboveground NPP (ANPP) and species richness in 40 sites across
   the Tibetan alpine grasslands from 2006 to 2009 to investigate the
   regional pattern of temporal variation in ANPP and to quantify the
   effects of climate fluctuation and biodiversity on this variation. The
   results showed that, during the 4-year period, the average ANPP varied
   1.5-fold, from 83.9 to 125.7 gm(-2), with a mean coefficient of
   variation of temporal variation of 36.6\% across the 40 sites. Compared
   with other studies, alpine grasslands are not more sensitive to climate
   fluctuations than other grassland types. Aboveground NPP exhibited
   synchronous temporal variation and consistent spatial patterns over the
   4-year period due to the regionally similar climatic fluctuations caused
   by monsoon-dominated plateau climate. Surprisingly, rainfall fluctuation
   had a more profound effect on the ANPP dynamics than temperature
   variation, which suggests that production in the Tibetan alpine
   grasslands is primarily driven by precipitation. Therefore, ANPP in the
   Tibetan alpine grasslands are mainly constrained by water availability.
   Finally, we found a reduction in interannual variation (i.e., CV) in
   ANPP with increasing species richness of plant communities, suggesting
   that diversity can stabilize community production in high-altitude
   grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are essential in atmospheric
   chemistry because of their chemical reactions that produce and destroy
   tropospheric ozone, their effects on aerosol formation and growth, and
   their potential influence on global warming. As one of the important
   BVOC groups, monoterpenes have been a focus of scientific attention in
   atmospheric research. Detailed regional measurements and model estimates
   are needed to study emission potential and the monoterpene budget on a
   global scale. Since the use of empirical measurements for upscaling is
   limited by many physical and biological factors, such as genetic
   variation, temperature and light, water availability, seasonal changes,
   and environmental stresses, comprehensive inventories over larger areas
   are difficult to obtain. We applied the
   boundary-layer-chemistry-transport model SOSA (model to Simulate the
   concentrations of Organic vapours and Sulphuric Acid) to investigate
   Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) monoterpene emissions in a boreal
   coniferous forest at the SMEAR (Station for Measuring forest
   Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations) II site, southern Finland. SOSA was
   applied to simulate monoterpene emissions with three different emission
   modules: the semiempirical G95, MEGAN (Model of Emissions of Gases and
   Aerosols from Nature) 2.04 with improved descriptions of temperature and
   light responses and including also carbonyl emissions, and a
   process-based model SIM-BIM (Seasonal Isoprenoid synthase Model
   -Biochemical Isoprenoid biosynthesis Model). For the first time, the
   emission models included seasonal and diurnal variations in both
   quantity and chemical species of emitted monoterpenes, based on
   parameterizations obtained from field measurements. Results indicate
   that modelling and observations agreed reasonably well and that the
   model can be used for investigating regional air chemistry questions
   related to monoterpenes. The predominant modelled monoterpene
   concentrations, alpha-pinene and Delta(3)-carene, are consistent with
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Using an ongoing land conflict in Ciudad Juarez as a case study, I seek
   to show how maquiladora decision makers stabilize a regional development
   model even at times of extreme social and economic crisis. I argue that
   the current killings associated with drug trafficking play an ambivalent
   role in the reproduction of order in Juarez. At first sight, the
   violence is represented as a threat, unmasking as it does a regional
   development model as failure. Decision makers accordingly respond by
   doing everything possible to distance the maquiladora industry from the
   violence. On the one hand, this is being done by familiar means, not
   unlike in previous moments of crises. But on the other hand the events
   around Lomas del Poleo additionally assume a new quality, as
   maquiladorization goes hand in hand with an explicit strategy of spatial
   distanciation, integrating places and people that have hitherto been
   linked only marginally to the industry. And it is here that the
   narco-related violence plays different roles: as a convenient veil that
   allows what might be termed `ordinary' assertions of brute force to be
   used under the cover of extraordinary, excessive, violence; and as a
   welcome excuse in moments of emergency that legitimize violent measures
   for the sake of a greater good.}},

Title = {{Towards a new classification system for legumes: Progress report from

Abstract = {{Legume systematists have been making great progress in understanding
   evolutionary relationships within the Leguminosae (Fabaceae), the third
   largest family of flowering plants. As the phylogenetic picture has
   become clearer, so too has the need for a revised classification of the
   family. The organization of the family into three subfamilies and 42
   tribes is outdated and evolutionarily misleading. The three
   traditionally recognized subfamilies, Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae, and
   Papilionoideae, do not adequately represent relationships within the
   family. The occasion of the Sixth International Legume Conference in
   Johannesburg, South Africa in January 2013, with its theme ``Towards a
   new classification system for legumes,{''} provided the impetus to move
   forward with developing a new classification. A draft classification,
   based on current phylogenetic results and a set of principles and
   guidelines, was prepared in advance of the conference as the basis for
   discussion. The principles, guidelines, and draft classification were
   presented and debated at the conference. The objectives of the
   discussion were to develop consensus on the principles that should guide
   the development of the classification, to discuss the draft
   classification's strengths and weaknesses and make proposals for its
   revision, and identify and prioritize phylogenetic deficiencies that
   must be resolved before the classification could be published. This
   paper describes the collaborative process by a large group of legume
   systematists, publishing under the name Legume Phylogeny Working Group,
   to develop a new phylogenetic classification system for the Leguminosae.
   The goals of this paper are to inform the broader legume community, and
   others, of the need for a revised classification, and spell out clearly
   what the alternatives and challenges are for a new classification system
   for the family. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The calibration of remote sensing instruments is a crucial step in the
   generation of products tied to international reference standards.
   Calibrating imaging spectrometers is particularly demanding due to the
   high number of spatiospectral pixels and, consequently, the large amount
   of data acquired during calibration sequences. Storage of these data and
   associated meta-data in an organized manner, as well as the provision of
   efficient tools for the data analysis and fast and repeatable
   calibration coefficient generation with provenance information, is key
   to the provision of traceable measurements. The airborne prism
   experiment (APEX) calibration information system is a multilayered
   information technology solution comprising a database based on the
   entity-attribute-value (EAV) paradigm and software written in Java and
   MATLAB, providing data access, visualization and processing, and
   handling the data volumes over the expected lifetime of the system.
   Although developed in the context of APEX, the system is rather generic
   and may be adapted to other pushbroom-based imagers with little effort.}},

Abstract = {{The maximum temperature experienced by biomass during combustion has a
   strong effect on chemical properties of the resulting charcoal, such as
   sorption capacity (water and nonpolar materials) and microbial
   degradability. However, information about the formation temperature of
   natural charcoal can be difficult to obtain in ecosystems that are not
   instrumented prior to fires. Benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) are
   molecular markers specific for pyrogenic carbon (PyC) which can provide
   information on the degree of aromatic condensation in charcoals. Here we
   apply the BPCA molecular marker method to a set of 10 charcoals produced
   during an experimental fire in a Pitch pine-scrub oak forest from litter
   and bark of pitch pine and inkberry plants in the Pine lands National
   Reserve in New Jersey, USA. We deployed temperature-sensitive crayons
   throughout the burn site, which recorded the maximum air temperature and
   made comparisons to the degree of thermal alteration recorded by BPCA
   molecular markers. Our results show an increase of the degree of
   aromatic condensation with monitored temperatures for bark biomass,
   while for needles no clear trend could be observed. For leaf-derived
   charcoals at increasing monitored fire temperatures, decreasing degree
   of aromatic condensation was obtained. This suggests that molecular
   markers can be used to roughly estimate the maximum fire temperatures
   experienced by bark and wood materials, but not based on leaf- and
   needle-derived materials. Possible applications include verifying
   declared pyrolysis temperatures of biochars and evaluating ecosystem
   fire temperature postburn.}},

Abstract = {{Local adaptation to different pollinators is considered one of the
   possible initial stages of ecological speciation as reproductive
   isolation is a by-product of the divergence in pollination systems.
   However, pollinator-mediated divergent selection will not necessarily
   result in complete reproductive isolation, because incipient speciation
   is often overcome by gene flow. We investigated the potential of
   pollinator shift in the sexually deceptive orchids Ophrys sphegodes and
   Ophrys exaltata and compared the levels of floral isolation vs. genetic
   distance among populations with contrasting predominant pollinators. We
   analysed floral hydrocarbons as a proxy for floral divergence between
   populations. Floral adoption of pollinators and their fidelity was
   tested using pollinator choice experiments. Interpopulation gene flow
   and population differentiation levels were estimated using AFLP markers.
   The Tyrrhenian O.sphegodes population preferentially attracted the
   pollinator bee Andrena bimaculata, whereas the Adriatic O.sphegodes
   population exclusively attracted A.nigroaenea. Significant differences
   in scent component proportions were identified in O.sphegodes
   populations that attracted different preferred pollinators. High
   interpopulation gene flow was detected, but populations were genetically
   structured at species level. The high interpopulation gene flow levels
   independent of preferred pollinators suggest that local adaptation to
   different pollinators has not (yet) generated detectable genome-wide
   separation. Alternatively, despite extensive gene flow, few genes
   underlying floral isolation remain differentiated as a consequence of
   divergent selection. Different pollination ecotypes in O.sphegodes might
   represent a local selective response imposed by temporal variation in a
   geographical mosaic of pollinators as a consequence of the frequent
   disturbance regimes typical of Ophrys habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The threat of punishment usually promotes cooperation. However,
   punishing itself is costly, rare in nonhuman animals, and humans who
   punish often finish with low payoffs in economic experiments. The
   evolution of punishment has therefore been unclear. Recent theoretical
   developments suggest that punishment has evolved in the context of
   reputation games. We tested this idea in a simple helping game with
   observers and with punishment and punishment reputation (experimentally
   controlling for other possible reputational effects). We show that
   punishers fully compensate their costs as they receive help more often.
   The more likely defection is punished within a group, the higher the
   level of within-group cooperation. These beneficial effects perish if
   the punishment reputation is removed. We conclude that reputation is key
   to the evolution of punishment.}},

Abstract = {{DNA accessibility is an important layer of regulation of DNA-dependent
   processes. Methods that measure DNA accessibility at local and
   genome-wide scales have facilitated a rapid increase in the knowledge of
   chromatin architecture in animal and yeast systems. In contrast, much
   less is known about chromatin organization in plants. We developed a
   robust DNase I-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol for the model
   plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). DNA accessibility is probed by
   digesting nuclei with a gradient of DNase I followed by locus-specific
   PCR. The reduction in PCR product formation along the gradient of
   increasing DNase I concentrations is used to determine the accessibility
   of the chromatin DNA. We explain a strategy to calculate the decay
   constant of such signal reduction as a function of increasing DNase I
   concentration. This allows describing DNA accessibility using a single
   variable: the decay constant. We also used the protocol together with
   AGRONOMICS1 DNA tiling microarrays to establish genome-wide DNase I
   sensitivity landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Quercus praedelavayi Xing Y.W. et Zhou Z.K. sp. nov. is reported from
   the upper Miocene of the Xianfeng flora in central Yunnan, southwestern
   China. The fossil species is identified based on the detailed leaf
   morphological and cuticular examinations. The primary venation is
   pinnate and the major secondary venation is craspedodromous with regular
   spacing. Stomata are anomocytic and occur on abaxial epidermis. Trichome
   bases are unicellular and multicellular. The new fossil species shows
   the closest affinity with Quercus delavayi, an extant species
   distributing in southwestern China. The responses of the functional leaf
   traits to the climate change were studied by comparing the leaf
   characters of fossil species and its nearest living relative. The
   stomatal density of Q. praedelavayi is higher than Q. delavayi, which
   suggests a lower palaeoatmospheric CO2 concentration during the late
   Miocene. The trichome base density of Q. praedelavayi is higher than the
   extant Q delavayi. Considering the palaeoclimatic reconstruction of
   Xianfeng flora, it rejected the hypothesis that increase in trichome
   density is an adaptation to the drier environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent progress of CO2 eddy covariance (EC) technique and accumulation
   of measurements offer an unprecedented perspective to study the land
   surface phenology (LSP) in a more objective way than previously possible
   by allowing the actual photosynthesis measurement - gross primary
   productivity (GPP). Because of the spatial, temporal, and ecological
   complexity of processes controlling GPP time series, the extraction of
   important LSP dates from GPP has been elusive. Here, we present
   objective measures of several LSP metrics from GPP time series data. A
   case study based on long term GPP measurements over a mature boreal
   deciduous forest is provided together with LSP estimates from remote
   sensing data. Results show that most LSP metrics are interrelated within
   each season (spring and autumn) both from GPP and remote sensing based
   estimates. We provide simple mathematical derivatives of GPP time series
   to objectively estimate key LSP metrics such as: the start, end and
   length of growing season; end of greenup; start of browndown; length of
   canopy closure; start, end and length of peak; and peak of season. These
   key LSP metrics indicate the collective ecological responses to
   environmental changes over space and time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Temperature is considered an important determinant of biodiversity
   distribution patterns. Grasses (Poaceae) occupy among the warmest and
   coldest environments on earth but the role of cold tolerance evolution
   in generating this distribution is understudied. We studied cold
   tolerance of Danthonioideae (c. 280 species), a major constituent of the
   austral temperate grass flora. We determined differences in cold
   tolerance among species from different continents grown in a common
   winter garden and assessed the relationship between measured cold
   tolerance and that predicted by species ranges. We then used
   temperatures in current ranges and a phylogeny of 81\% of the species to
   study the timing and mode of cold tolerance evolution across the
   subfamily. Species ranges generally underestimate cold tolerance but are
   still a meaningful representation of differences in cold tolerance among
   species. We infer cold tolerance evolution to have commenced at the
   onset of danthonioid diversification, subsequently increasing in both
   pace and extent in certain lineages. Interspecific variation in cold
   tolerance is better accounted for by spatial than phylogenetic distance.
   Contrary to expectations, temperature low temperature in particular
   appears not to limit the distribution of this temperate clade.
   Competition, time or dispersal limitation could explain its relative
   absence from northern temperate regions.}},

Abstract = {{Many plant species combine sexual and clonal reproduction. Clonal
   propagation has ecological costs mainly related to inbreeding depression
   and pollen discounting; at the same time, species able to reproduce
   clonally have ecological and evolutionary advantages being able to
   persist when conditions are not favorable for sexual reproduction. The
   presence of clonality has profound consequences on the genetic structure
   of populations, especially when it represents the predominant
   reproductive strategy in a population. Theoretical studies suggest that
   high rate of clonal propagation should increase the effective number of
   alleles and heterozygosity in a population, while an opposite effect is
   expected on genetic differentiation among populations and on genotypic
   diversity. In this study, we ask how clonal propagation affects the
   genetic diversity of rare insular species, which are often characterized
   by low levels of genetic diversity, hence at risk of extinction. We used
   eight polymorphic microsatellite markers to study the genetic structure
   of the critically endangered insular endemic Ruta microcarpa. We found
   that clonality appears to positively affect the genetic diversity of R.
   microcarpa by increasing allelic diversity, polymorphism, and
   heterozygosity. Moreover, clonal propagation seems to be a more
   successful reproductive strategy in small, isolated population subjected
   to environmental stress. Our results suggest that clonal propagation may
   benefit rare species. However, the advantage of clonal growth may be
   only short-lived for prolonged clonal growth could ultimately lead to
   monoclonal populations. Some degree of sexual reproduction may be needed
   in a predominantly clonal species to ensure long-term viability.}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The adaptive landscape is an iconic metaphor that pervades evolutionary
   biology. It was mostly applied in theoretical models until recent years,
   when empirical data began to allow partial landscape reconstructions.
   Here, we exhaustively analyse 1,137 complete landscapes from 129
   eukaryotic species, each describing the binding affinity of a
   transcription factor to all possible short DNA sequences. We find that
   the navigability of these landscapes through single mutations is
   intermediate to that of additive and shuffled null models, suggesting
   that binding affinity-and thereby gene expression-is readily fine-tuned
   via mutations in transcription factor binding sites. The landscapes have
   few peaks that vary in their accessibility and in the number of
   sequences they contain. Binding sites in the mouse genome are enriched
   in sequences found in the peaks of especially navigable landscapes and
   the genetic diversity of binding sites in yeast increases with the
   number of sequences in a peak. Our findings suggest that landscape
   navigability may have contributed to the enormous success of
   transcriptional regulation as a source of evolutionary adaptations and
   innovations.}},

Title = {{Leaf area increases with species richness in young experimental stands
   of subtropical trees}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   Most biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research has been carried out in
   grassland ecosystems, and little is known about whether forest
   ecosystems, in particular outside the temperate zone, respond similarly.
   Here, we tested whether productivity, assessed as leaf area index (LAI),
   increases with species richness in young experimental stands of
   subtropical trees, whether this response is similar for early-season
   leaf area (which is dominated by evergreens) and seasonal leaf area
   increase (which is dominated by deciduous species), and whether
   responses saturate at high species richness.
   Methods
   We used a planted tree biodiversity experiment in south-east China to
   test our hypotheses. LAI was determined three times by digital
   hemispheric photography in 144 plots that had been planted with 400
   trees each, forming communities with 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 tree species.
   Important Findings
   LAI increased significantly with tree species richness in the fifth year
   of stand establishment. Similar, but weaker, statistically
   non-significant trends were observed 1 year before. We did not observe
   leaf area over-yielding and the presence of particularly productive and
   unproductive species explained large amounts of variation in leaf area,
   suggesting that selection-type effects contributed substantially to the
   biodiversity effects we found in this early phase of stand
   establishment. Effects sizes were moderate to large and comparable in
   magnitude to the ones reported for grassland ecosystems. Subtropical
   (and tropical) forests harbor substantial parts of global net primary
   production and are critical for the Earth's carbon and hydrological
   cycle, and our results suggest that tree diversity critically supports
   these ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{The PREDICTS project-Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In
   Changing Terrestrial Systems (www.predicts.org.uk)-has collated from
   published studies a large, reasonably representative database of
   comparable samples of biodiversity from multiple sites that differ in
   the nature or intensity of human impacts relating to land use. We have
   used this evidence base to develop global and regional statistical
   models of how local biodiversity responds to these measures. We describe
   and make freely available this 2016 release of the database, containing
   more than 3.2 million records sampled at over 26,000 locations and
   representing over 47,000 species. We outline how the database can help
   in answering a range of questions in ecology and conservation biology.
   To our knowledge, this is the largest and most geographically and
   taxonomically representative database of spatial comparisons of
   biodiversity that has been collated to date; it will be useful to
   researchers and international efforts wishing to model and understand
   the global status of biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{The habitats of polyploid species are generally distinct from their
   parental species. Stebbins described polyploids as ` general purpose
   genotypes', which can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.
   However, little is known about its molecular basis because of the
   complexity of polyploid genomes. We hypothesized that allopolyploid
   species might utilize the expression patterns of both parents depending
   on environments (polyploid plasticity hypothesis). We focused on
   hydrological niche segregation along fine-scale soil moisture and
   waterlogging gradients. Two diploid species, Cardamine amara and
   Cardamine hirsuta, grew best in submerged and unsubmerged conditions,
   respectively, consistent with their natural habitats. Interestingly, the
   allotetraploid Cardamine flexuosa derived from them grew similarly in
   fluctuating as well as submerged and unsubmerged conditions, consistent
   with its wide environmental tolerance. A similar pattern was found in
   another species trio: allotetraploid Cardamine scutata and its parents.
   Using the close relatedness of Cardamine and Arabidopsis, we quantified
   genomewide expression patterns following dry and wet treatments using an
   Arabidopsis microarray. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that
   the expression pattern of C. flexuosa clustered with C. hirsuta in the
   dry condition and with C. amara in the wet condition, supporting our
   hypothesis. Furthermore, the induction levels of most genes in the
   allopolyploid were lower than in a specialist diploid species. This
   reflects a disadvantage of being allopolyploid arising from fixed
   heterozygosity. We propose that recurrent allopolyploid speciation along
   soil moisture and waterlogging gradients confers niche differentiation
   and reproductive isolation simultaneously and serves as a model for
   studying the molecular basis of ecological speciation and adaptive
   radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Finding causal relationships between genotypic and phenotypic variation
   is a key focus of evolutionary biology, human genetics and plant
   breeding. To identify genome-wide patterns underlying trait diversity,
   we assembled a high-quality reference genome of Cardamine hirsuta, a
   close relative of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We combined
   comparative genome and transcriptome analyses with the experimental
   tools available in C. hirsuta to investigate gene function and
   phenotypic diversification. Our findings highlight the prevalent role of
   transcription factors and tandem gene duplications in morphological
   evolution. We identified a specific role for the transcriptional
   regulators PLETHORA5/7 in shaping leaf diversity and link tandem gene
   duplication with differential gene expression in the explosive seed pod
   of C. hirsuta. Our work highlights the value of comparative approaches
   in genetically tractable species to understand the genetic basis for
   evolutionary change.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorophyll degradation is the most obvious hallmark of leaf senescence.
   Phyllobilins, linear tetrapyrroles that are derived from opening of the
   chlorin macrocycle by the Rieske-type oxygenase PHEOPHORBIDE a OXYGENASE
   (PAO), are the end products of chlorophyll degradation. Phyllobilins
   carry defined modifications at several peripheral positions within the
   tetrapyrrole backbone. While most of these modifications are
   species-specific, hydroxylation at the C3(2) position is commonly found
   in all species analyzed to date. We demonstrate that this hydroxylation
   occurs in senescent chloroplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana. Using bell
   pepper (Capsicum annuum) chromoplasts, we establish that phyllobilin
   hydroxylation is catalyzed by a membrane-bound, molecular
   oxygen-dependent, and ferredoxin-dependent activity. As these features
   resemble the requirements of PAO, we considered membrane-bound
   Rieske-type oxygenases as potential candidates. Analysis of mutants of
   the two Arabidopsis Rieske-type oxygenases (besides PAO) uncovered that
   phyllobilin hydroxylation depends on TRANSLOCON AT THE INNER CHLOROPLAST
   ENVELOPE55 (TIC55). Our work demonstrates a catalytic activity for
   TIC55, which in the past has been considered as a redox sensor of
   protein import into plastids. Given the wide evolutionary distribution
   of both PAO and TIC55, we consider that chlorophyll degradation likely
   coevolved with land plants.}},

Abstract = {{Registration of veterinary medical products includes the provision that
   field tests may be required to assess potential nontarget effects
   associated with the excretion of product residues in dung of treated
   livestock (phase II, tier B testing). However, regulatory agencies
   provide no guidance on the format of these tests. In the present study,
   the authors report on the development of a standardized field test
   method designed to serve as a tier B test. Dung was collected from
   cattle before and up to 2 mo after treatment with a topical application
   of a test compound (ivermectin). Pats formed of dung from the different
   treatments were placed concurrently in the field to be colonized by
   insects. The abundance, richness, and diversity of insects developing
   from egg to adult in these pats were compared across treatments using
   analysis of variance tests. Regression analyses were used to regress
   abundance, richness, and diversity against residue concentrations in
   each treatment. Results of the regression were used to estimate mean
   lethal concentration (LC50) values. The robustness of the method and the
   repeatability of its findings were assessed concurrently in 4 countries
   (Canada, France, Switzerland, and The Netherlands) in climatically
   diverse ecoregions. Results were generally consistent across countries,
   and support the method's formal adoption by the European Union to assess
   the effects of veterinary medical product residues on the composition

Abstract = {{Improving the understanding of how stream flow dynamics are influenced
   by landscape characteristics, such as soils, vegetation and terrain, is
   a central endeavor of catchment hydrology. Here we investigate how
   spatial variability in stream flow is related to landscape
   characteristics using specific discharge time series from 14 partly
   nested subcatchments in the Krycklan basin (0.12 - 68 km(2)).
   Multivariate principal component analyses combined with univariate
   analyses showed that while variability in landscape characteristics and
   specific discharge were strongly related, the spatial patterns varied
   with season and wetness conditions. During spring snowmelt and at the
   annual scale, specific discharge was positively related to the sum of
   wetland and lake area. During summer, when flows are lowest, specific
   discharge was negatively related to catchment tree volume, but
   positively related to deeper sediment deposits and catchment area. The
   results indicate how more densely forested areas on till soils become
   relatively drier during summer months, while wet areas and deeper
   sediment soils maintain a higher summer base flow. Annual and seasonal
   differences in specific discharge can therefore be explained to a large
   extent by expected variability in evapotranspiration fluxes and snow
   accumulation. These analyses provide an organizing principle for how
   specific discharge varies spatially across the boreal landscape, and how
   this variation is manifested for different wetness conditions, seasons
   and time scales.}},

Title = {{The relative importance of reproduction and survival for the

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that in slow-growing vertebrate populations
   survival generally has a greater influence on population growth than
   reproduction. Despite many studies cautioning against such
   generalizations for conservation, wildlife management for slow-growing
   populations still often focuses on perturbing survival without careful
   evaluation as to whether those changes are likely or feasible. Here, we
   evaluate the relative importance of reproduction and survival for the
   conservation of two bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops cf aduncus)
   populations: a large, apparently stable population and a smaller one
   that is forecast to decline. We also assessed the feasibility and
   effectiveness of wildlife management objectives aimed at boosting either
   reproduction or survival. Consistent with other analytically based
   elasticity studies, survival had the greatest effect on population
   trajectories when altering vital rates by equal proportions. However,
   the findings of our alternative analytical approaches are in stark
   contrast to commonly used proportional sensitivity analyses and suggest
   that reproduction is considerably more important. We show that
   1 in the stable population reproductive output is higher, and adult
   survival is lower;
   2 the difference in viability between the two populations is due to the
   difference in reproduction;
   3 reproductive rates are variable, whereas survival rates are relatively
   constant over time;
   4 perturbations on the basis of observed, temporal variation indicate
   that population dynamics are much more influenced by reproduction than
   by adult survival;
   5 for the apparently declining population, raising reproductive rates
   would be an effective and feasible tool to reverse the forecast
   population decline; increasing survival would be ineffective.
   Our findings highlight the importance of reproduction - even in
   slow-growing populations - and the need to assess the effect of natural
   variation in vital rates on population viability. We echo others in
   cautioning against generalizations based on life-history traits and
   recommend that population modeling for conservation should also take
   into account the magnitude of vital rate changes that could be attained
   under alternative management scenarios.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The fast penetration of nanoproducts on the market under conditions of
   significant uncertainty of their environmental properties and risks to
   humans creates a need for companies to assess sustainability of their
   products. Evaluation of the potential benefits and risks to build a
   coherent story for communication with clients, authorities, consumers,
   and other stakeholders is getting to be increasingly important, but SMEs
   often lack the knowledge and expertise to assess risks and communicate
   them appropriately. This paper introduces LICARA nanoSCAN, a modular web
   based tool that supports SMEs in assessing benefits and risks associated
   with new or existing nanoproducts. This tool is unique because it is
   scanning both the benefits and risks over the nanoproducts life cycle in
   comparison to a reference product with a similar functionality in order
   to enable the development of sustainable and competitive nanoproducts.
   SMEs can use data and expert judgment to answer mainly qualitative and
   semi-quantitative questions as a part of tool application. Risks to
   public, workers and consumers are assessed, while the benefits are
   evaluated for economic, environmental and societal opportunities
   associated with the product use. The tool provides an easy way to
   visualize results as well as to identify gaps, missing data and
   associated uncertainties. The LICARA nanoSCAN has been positively
   evaluated by several companies and was tested in a number of case
   studies. The tool helps to develop a consistent and comprehensive
   argument on the weaknesses and strengths of a nanoproduct that may be
   valuable for the communication with authorities, clients and among
   stakeholders in the value chain. LICARA nanoSCAN identifies areas for
   more detailed assessments, product design improvement or application of
   risk mitigation measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{Many of the observed species interactions embedded in ecological
   communities are not permanent, but are characterized by temporal changes
   that are observed along with abiotic and biotic variations. While work
   has been done describing and quantifying these changes, little is known
   about their consequences for species coexistence. Here, we investigate
   the extent to which changes of species composition impact the likelihood
   of persistence of the predator-prey community in the highly seasonal
   Bialowieza Primeval Forest (northeast Poland), and the extent to which
   seasonal changes of species interactions (predator diet) modulate the
   expected impact. This likelihood is estimated extending recent
   developments on the study of structural stability in ecological
   communities. We find that the observed species turnover strongly varies
   the likelihood of community persistence between summer and winter.
   Importantly, we demonstrate that the observed seasonal interaction
   changes minimize the variation in the likelihood of persistence
   associated with species turnover across the year. We find that these
   community dynamics can be explained as the coupling of individual
   species to their environment by minimizing both the variation in
   persistence conditions and the interaction changes between seasons. Our
   results provide a homeostatic explanation for seasonal species
   interactions and suggest that monitoring the association of interactions
   changes with the level of variation in community dynamics can provide a
   good indicator of the response of species to environmental pressures.}},

Title = {{Allopatric speciation with little niche divergence is common among

Abstract = {{AimDespite the accumulation of cases describing fast radiations of
   alpine plants, we still have limited understanding of the drivers of
   speciation in alpine floras and of the precise the timing of their
   diversification. Here, we investigated spatial and temporal patterns of
   speciation in three groups of alpine Primulaceae.
   LocationMountains of the European Alpine System.
   MethodsWe built a new phylogeny of Primulaceae including all species in
   three focal groups: Androsace sect. Aretia, Primula sect. Auricula and
   Soldanella. Combining phylogenetic information with a detailed climatic
   data set, we investigated patterns of range and ecological overlap
   between sister-species using an approach that takes phylogenetic
   uncertainty into account. Finally, we investigated temporal trajectories
   of diversification in the three focal groups.
   ResultsWe found that a large majority of sister-species pairs in the
   three groups are strictly allopatric and show little differences in
   substrate and climatic preferences, a result that was robust to
   phylogenetic uncertainty. While rates of diversification have remained
   constant in Soldanella, both Androsace sect. Aretia and Primula sect.
   Auricula showed decreased diversification rates in the Pleistocene
   compared to previous geological epochs.
   Main conclusionsAllopatric speciation with little niche divergence
   appears to have been by far the most common mode of speciation across
   the three groups studied. A few examples, however, suggest that
   ecological and polyploid speciation might also have played a role in the
   diversification of these three groups. Finally, extensive
   diversification likely occurred in the late Miocene and Pliocene
   coinciding with the later phases of the Alpine uplift, while
   diversification slowed down during subsequent glacial cycles of the
   Pleistocene.}},

Title = {{Does sexual selection shape sex differences in longevity and senescence

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},

Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{In most mammals, both sexes display different survival patterns, often
   involving faster senescence in males. Being under intense sexual
   competition to secure mating opportunities, males of polygynous species
   allocate resources to costly behaviors and conspicuous sexual traits,
   which might explain these observed differences in longevity and
   senescence patterns. However, comparative studies performed to date have
   led to conflicting results. We aimed to resolve this problem by first
   reviewing case studies of the relationship between the strength of
   sexual selection and age-specific survival metrics. Then, we performed a
   comprehensive comparative analysis to test whether such relationships
   exist among species of captive ruminants. We found that the strength of
   sexual selection negatively influenced the onset of actuarial senescence
   in males, with males senescing earlier in polygynous than in monogamous
   species, which led to reduced male longevity in polygynous species.
   Moreover, males of territorial species senesced earlier but slower, and
   have a shorter longevity than males of species displaying other mating
   tactics. We detected little influence of the strength of sexual
   selection on the rate of actuarial senescence. Our findings demonstrate
   that the onset of actuarial senescence, rather than its rate, is a side
   effect of physiological mechanisms linked to sexual selection, and
   potentially accounts for observed differences in longevity.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear response of vegetation green-up to local temperature
   variations in temperate and boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{100-108}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The annual cycle of vegetation growth may be altered in response to
   climate changes affecting ecosystem dynamics. However, our understanding
   of vegetation seasonality is mostly limited to the mechanisms and
   attributes of phenological events, such as spring emergence and fall
   senescence. Here we have investigated the seasonal evolution of
   vegetation growth from winter dormancy to summer maturity of four forest
   types in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperate and boreal forests for
   1982-2011. The present study assesses large-scale variations in the
   vegetation green-up rate (VG(rate)) and its connection to temperature
   variability using remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) and surface air temperature. The average of the VG(ate) of the
   analysis period increases with latitude, which indicates that the canopy
   develops more rapidly from dormancy to maturity for vegetation in
   higher-latitude or colder climate zones. VG(rate) and precedent
   temperature also show a positive correlation (r) over temperate and
   boreal forests (67\% of the forest area in the NH), indicating that
   increased temperatures lead to faster canopy development within the same
   climate zone or latitude band. Responsiveness of VG(rate) to temperature
   variability shows that despite the same magnitude of local temperature
   variability during extremely cold and warm years, the magnitude of
   VG(rate) acceleration in warm years (0.07 (15-day)(-1)) is larger than
   the VG(rate) deceleration in cold years (-0.03 (15-day)(-1)), suggesting
   that the response of VG(rate) to temperature variability is nonlinear.
   Among the four forest types examined in this study, the nonlinear
   responses are most clearly observed in deciduous broadleaf forests
   indicating that forest composition may regulate the large-scale response
   of canopy development to temperature variability. Overall, our results
   suggest that anomalous seasonal warming will significantly affect canopy
   developments over wide deciduous forest areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Unveiling the mechanisms that promote coexistence in biological
   communities is a fundamental problem in ecology. Stable coexistence of
   many species is commonly observed in natural communities. Most of these
   natural communities, however, are composed of species from multiple
   trophic and functional groups, while theory and experiments on
   coexistence have been focusing on functionally similar species. Here, we
   investigated how functional diversity affects the stability of species
   coexistence and productivity in multispecies communities by
   characterizing experimentally all pairwise species interactions in a
   pool of 11 species of eukaryotes (10 protists and one rotifer) belonging
   to three different functional groups. Species within the same functional
   group showed stronger competitive interactions compared to
   among-functional group interactions. This often led to competitive
   exclusion between species that had higher functional relatedness, but
   only at low levels of species richness. Communities with higher
   functional diversity resulted in increased species coexistence and
   community biomass production. Our experimental findings and the results
   of a stochastic model tailored to the experimental interaction matrix
   suggest the emergence of strong stabilizing forces when species from
   different functional groups interact in a homogeneous environment. By
   combining theoretical analysis with experiments we could also
   disentangle the relationship between species richness and functional
   diversity, showing that functional diversity per se is a crucial driver
   of productivity and stability in multispecies community.}},

Abstract = {{Movement and dispersal are critical processes for almost all organisms
   in natural populations. Understanding their causes and consequences is
   therefore of high interest. While both theoretical and empirical work
   suggest that dispersal, more exactly emigration, is plastic and may be a
   function of local population density, the functional relationship
   between the underlying movement strategies and population density has
   received less attention. We here present evidence for the shape of this
   reaction norm and are able to differentiate between three possible cues:
   the relative number of individuals, the presence of metabolites
   (chemical cues) and resource availability. We performed microcosm
   experiments with the ciliate model organism Tetrahymena in order to
   understand the plasticity of movement strategies with respect to local
   density while controlling for possible confounding effects mediated by
   the availability of different cues. In addition, we investigated how an
   Allee effect can influence movement and dispersal plasticity. Our
   findings suggest that movement strategies in Tetrahymena are plastic and
   density-dependent. The observed movement reaction norm was U-shaped.
   This may be due to an Allee effect which led to negative density
   dependence at low population densities and generally positive density
   dependence at high population densities due to local competition. This
   possibly adaptive density-dependent movement strategy was likely
   mediated by chemical cues. Our experimental work in highly controlled
   conditions indicates that both environmental cues as well as inherent
   population dynamics must be considered to understand movement and
   dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress has been suggested as a mechanism underlying the costs
   of reproduction and life history trade-offs. Reproductive activities may
   lead to high production of pro-oxidants, whose activity can generate
   oxidative damage when not countered by adequate antioxidant defenses.
   Because inter-individual differences in the efficiency of the
   antioxidant system are influenced by an individual's diet, food
   availability experienced during reproduction may affect the females'
   antioxidant status and, in birds, their ability to transfer antioxidants
   into their eggs. Moreover, a female's ability to cope with oxidative
   stress has been suggested to influence pigment deposition in the
   eggshell, suggesting a possible signaling function of eggshell
   maculation. Here we performed a food supplementation experiment in a
   natural population of great tits (Parus major) in order to investigate
   how nutritional conditions experienced during the egg laying period
   affect the female's oxidative status and egg investment and how maternal
   oxidative status and egg antioxidant protection relate to eggshell
   pigmentation. We show that food-supplemented females had lower oxidative
   damage levels (ROMs) than non-food-supplemented females. Furthermore, a
   female's ROMs levels were negatively associated with the levels of yolk
   antioxidant protection in her eggs, but this negative association was
   only significant in non-food-supplemented females. This suggests that
   oxidative stress experienced during reproduction influences the
   allocation of antioxidants into the eggs. Moreover, we observed a
   positive relationship between eggshell pigment distribution and maternal
   and yolk antioxidant protection, suggesting that eggshell pigmentation
   is a cue of female (and offspring) quality.}},

Title = {{Establishment of Anthoceros agrestis as a model species for studying the
   biology of hornworts}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Plants colonized terrestrial environments approximately 480
   million years ago and have contributed significantly to the
   diversification of life on Earth. Phylogenetic analyses position a
   subset of charophyte algae as the sister group to land plants, and
   distinguish two land plant groups that diverged around 450 million years
   ago - the bryophytes and the vascular plants. Relationships between
   liverworts, mosses hornworts and vascular plants have proven difficult
   to resolve, and as such it is not clear which bryophyte lineage is the
   sister group to all other land plants and which is the sister to
   vascular plants. The lack of comparative molecular studies in
   representatives of all three lineages exacerbates this uncertainty. Such
   comparisons can be made between mosses and liverworts because
   representative model organisms are well established in these two
   bryophyte lineages. To date, however, a model hornwort species has not
   been available.
   Results: Here we report the establishment of Anthoceros agrestis as a
   model hornwort species for laboratory experiments. Axenic culture
   conditions for maintenance and vegetative propagation have been
   determined, and treatments for the induction of sexual reproduction and
   sporophyte development have been established. In addition, protocols
   have been developed for the extraction of DNA and RNA that is of a
   quality suitable for molecular analyses. Analysis of haploid-derived
   genome sequence data of two A. agrestis isolates revealed single
   nucleotide polymorphisms at multiple loci, and thus these two strains
   are suitable starting material for classical genetic and mapping
   experiments.
   Conclusions: Methods and resources have been developed to enable A.
   agrestis to be used as a model species for developmental, molecular,
   genomic, and genetic studies. This advance provides an unprecedented
   opportunity to investigate the biology of hornworts.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, there has been enormous interest in understanding
   the great diversity of microbial cooperative behaviors, including
   communication, group-based swarming, fruiting-body formation, and the
   secretion of group-beneficial enzymes and food-scavenging molecules.
   Zhang and Rainey, henceforth Z\&R, recently contended that
   sociomicrobiologists have been overzealous in their casting of microbes
   as inherently social organisms, and too hasty in interpreting microbial
   behaviors in a social evolutionary framework. This challenge accompanied
   a set of experiments in which they revisited one of the best-studied
   social behaviors in bacteria-the production of diffusible, sharable
   iron-scavenging siderophore molecules. Z\&R posit that their findings
   challenge the view that siderophore production is a cooperative trait.
   Here, we demonstrate that their arguments are flawed, and stem from both
   technical mistakes and misunderstandings of social evolution theory.}},

Abstract = {{Social and environmental factors influence key life-history processes
   and population dynamics by affecting fitness-related phenotypic traits
   such as body mass. The role of body mass is particularly pronounced in
   cooperative breeders due to variation in social status and consequent
   variation in access to resources. Investigating the mechanisms
   underlying variation in body mass and its demographic consequences can
   help elucidate how social and environmental factors affect the dynamics
   of cooperatively breeding populations. In this study, we present an
   analysis of the effect of individual variation in body mass on the
   temporal dynamics of group size and structure of a cooperatively
   breeding mongoose, the Kalahari meerkat, Suricata suricatta. First, we
   investigate how body mass interacts with social (dominance status and
   number of helpers) and environmental (rainfall and season) factors to
   influence key life-history processes (survival, growth, emigration and
   reproduction) in female meerkats. Next, using an individual-based
   population model, we show that the models explicitly including
   individual variation in body mass predict group dynamics better than
   those ignoring this morphological trait. Body mass influences group
   dynamics mainly through its effects on helper emigration and dominant
   reproduction. Rainfall has a trait-mediated, destabilizing effect on
   group dynamics, whereas the number of helpers has a direct and
   stabilizing effect. Counteracting effects of number of helpers on
   different demographic rates, despite generating temporal fluctuations,
   stabilizes group dynamics in the long term. Our study demonstrates that
   social and environmental factors interact to produce individual
   variation in body mass and accounting for this variation helps to
   explain group dynamics in this cooperatively breeding population.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{171-182}},

Abstract = {{Global change is predicted to cause non-random species loss in plant
   communities, with consequences for ecosystem functioning. However,
   beyond the simple effects of plant species richness, little is known
   about how plant diversity and its loss influence higher trophic levels,
   which are crucial to the functioning of many species-rich ecosystems. We
   analyzed to what extent woody plant phylogenetic diversity and species
   richness contribute to explaining the biomass and abundance of
   herbivorous and predatory arthropods in a species-rich forest in
   subtropical China. The biomass and abundance of leaf-chewing herbivores,
   and the biomass dispersion of herbivores within plots, increased with
   woody plant phylogenetic diversity. Woody plant species richness had
   much weaker effects on arthropods, but interacted with plant
   phylogenetic diversity to negatively affect the ratio of predator to
   herbivore biomass. Overall, our results point to a strong bottom-up
   control of functionally important herbivores mediated particularly by
   plant phylogenetic diversity, but do not support the general expectation
   that top-down predator effects increase with plant diversity. The
   observed effects appear to be driven primarily by increasing resource
   diversity rather than diversity-dependent primary productivity, as the
   latter did not affect arthropods. The strong effects of plant
   phylogenetic diversity and the overall weaker effects of plant species
   richness show that the diversity-dependence of ecosystem processes and
   interactions across trophic levels can depend fundamentally on
   non-random species associations. This has important implications for the
   regulation of ecosystem functions via trophic interaction pathways and
   for the way species loss may impact these pathways in species-rich
   forests.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Have millennia of human land use fundamentally altered the
   vegetation of a large proportion of the high Andean puna biome, with
   natural vegetation now restricted to inaccessible areas? Can
   inaccessible ledges be used as surrogates to infer the potential natural
   vegetation (PNV) in heavily impacted areas of the puna ecosystem of the
   high Andes? Is there a difference in plant community composition and
   diversity between the potential natural puna vegetation, represented by
   areas inaccessible to grazing and burning, and the anthropogenically
   disturbed vegetation found on nearby, but accessible, slopes?
   Location: Abra Maalaga Private Conservation Area, Cusco, southern
   Peruvian Andes.
   Methods: Four study habitats were chosen that comprised ledges and
   slopes from within and outside of the conservation area. For each
   habitat, vegetation composition was recorded using eight to twelve 2 x
   2-m(2) plots studied for species cover and abiotic variables.
   Results: Analysis of species richness using two-way ANOVAs with Tukey
   test found that plots from the three habitats inaccessible to
   anthropogenic disturbance exhibited similar richness levels, whereas
   plots accessible to grazing and anthropogenic burning had significantly
   higher species richness. Likewise, CCA separated out plots of the three
   habitats inaccessible to anthropogenic disturbance from the unconserved
   slope plots. Species indicator analyses found the three inaccessible
   habitats to share the largest number of indicator species, with none
   being shared by the accessible, unconserved slope habitat. The PNV,
   inferred from the inaccessible vegetation, comprises a mosaic of
   Polylepis pepei woodland and tussock grassland, dominated by Festuca
   aff. procera, Luzula gigantea, Valeriana mandoniana and Carex
   pichinchensis.
   Conclusions: As both the conserved and unconserved ledge habitats
   contain a vegetation that approaches that of the conserved slope, ledges
   can be taken as a surrogate to infer the PNV in heavily impacted areas
   where no conserved slopes are available. From preliminary data, the
   presumed PNV of the study area corresponds to a distinct vegetation
   assemblage including species previously unknown to science. Adjacent
   disturbed, accessible land contained a higher species diversity, with a
   flora that may have originated from localized, disturbed natural
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is an early and critical step in plant reproduction, leading
   to successful fertilization. It consists of many sequential processes,
   including adhesion of pollen grains onto the surface of stigmatic
   papilla cells, foot formation to strengthen pollen-stigma interaction,
   pollen hydration and germination, and pollen tube elongation and
   penetration. We have focused on an examination of the expressed genes in
   papilla cells, to increase understanding of the molecular systems of
   pollination. From three representative species of Brassicaceae
   (Arabidopsis thaliana, A. halleri and Brassica rapa), stigmatic papilla
   cells were isolated precisely by laser microdissection, and cell
   type-specific gene expression in papilla cells was determined by RNA
   sequencing. As a result, 17,240, 19,260 and 21,026 unigenes were defined
   in papilla cells of A. thaliana, A. halleri and B. rapa, respectively,
   and, among these, 12,311 genes were common to all three species. Among
   the17,240 genes predicted in A. thaliana, one-third were papilla
   specific while approximately half of the genes were detected in all
   tissues examined. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that genes related to
   a wide range of reproduction and development functions are expressed in
   papilla cells, particularly metabolism, transcription and
   membrane-mediated information exchange. These results reflect the
   conserved features of general cellular function and also the specific
   reproductive role of papilla cells, highlighting a complex cellular
   system regulated by a diverse range of molecules in these cells. This
   study provides fundamental biological knowledge to dissect the molecular
   mechanisms of pollination in papilla cells and will shed light on our
   understanding of plant reproduction mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) form an important family
   of anion channels involved in fundamental physiological processes in
   plants. Because of their importance, the role of ALMTs in plant
   physiology is studied extensively. In contrast, the structural basis of
   their functional properties is largely unknown. This lack of information
   limits the understanding of the functional and physiological differences
   between ALMTs and their impact on anion transport in plants. This study
   aimed at investigating the structural organization of the transmembrane
   domain of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) vacuolar channel
   AtALMT9. For that purpose, we performed a large-scale mutagenesis
   analysis and found two residues that form a salt bridge between the
   first and second putative transmembrane alpha-helices (TM alpha 1 and TM
   alpha 2). Furthermore, using a combination of pharmacological and
   mutagenesis approaches, we identified citrate as an ``open channel
   blocker{''} of AtALMT9 and used this tool to examine the inhibition
   sensitivity of different point mutants of highly conserved amino acid
   residues. By this means, we found a stretch within the cytosolic moiety
   of the TM alpha 5 that is a probable pore-forming domain. Moreover,
   using a citrate-insensitive AtALMT9 mutant and biochemical approaches,
   we could demonstrate that AtALMT9 forms a multimeric complex that is
   supposedly composed of four subunits. In summary, our data provide, to
   our knowledge, the first evidence about the structural organization of
   an ion channel of the ALMT family. We suggest that AtALMT9 is a tetramer
   and that the TMa5 domains of the subunits contribute to form the pore of
   this anion channel.}},

Abstract = {{The connection between religion, nature and conservation has become a
   prominent topic among scholars and conservation practitioners. Numerous
   studies have shown that spiritual beliefs have contributed to preserving
   important biodiversity in sacred areas around the world. In Western
   contexts, however, that link has been underexplored, perhaps due to a
   common view of Christianity as anti-naturalistic. Here, I rely on a
   literature review and first-hand observations to identify patterns and
   trends characterizing Catholic sacred sites in Central Italy. I show
   that a high proportion of the sites are located in natural areas, and
   that some types of sites and strands of Catholicism are associated with
   natural settings more frequently than others. Further, these natural
   sacred sites often display ecological features that highlight their
   important conservation role. Greater awareness and consideration of
   local spiritual heritages are recommended to guarantee more effective
   and integrated management of the sites.}},

Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The potential contribution of glaciers and ice caps to sea level rise is
   usually calculated by comparing the estimated total ice volume with the
   surface area of the ocean. Part of this total ice volume, however, does
   not contribute to sea level rise because it is below the surface of the
   ocean or below the levels of future lakes on land. The present
   communication points to this so far overlooked phenomenon and provides a
   first order-of-magnitude estimate. It is shown that the effect is small
   (most likely about 1 to 6 cm sea level equivalent) but systematic, could
   primarily affect earlier stages of global glacier vanishing, and should
   therefore be adequately considered. Now-available techniques of
   slope-related high-resolution glacier bed modelling have the potential
   to provide more detailed assessments in the future.}},

Title = {{Climate warming shifts carbon allocation from stemwood to roots in

Journal = {{GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{101-107}},
Abstract = {{Increased greening of northern forests, measured by the Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), has been presented as evidence that
   a warmer climate has increased both net primary productivity (NPP) and
   the carbon sink in boreal forests. However, higher production and
   greener canopies may accompany changes in carbon allocation that favor
   foliage or fine roots over less decomposable woody biomass. Furthermore,
   tree core data throughout mid- and northern latitudes have revealed a
   divergence problem (DP), a weakening in tree ring responses to warming
   over the past half century that is receiving increasing attention, but
   remains poorly understood. Often, the same sites exhibit trend
   inconsistency phenomenon (TIP), namely positive, or no trends in growing
   season NDVI where negative trends in tree ring indexes are observed.
   Here we studied growth of two Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands in
   western Russia that exhibited both the DP and TIP but were subject to
   soil acidification and calcium depletion of differing timing and
   severity. Our results link the decline in radial growth starting in 1980
   to a shift in carbon allocation from wood to roots driven by a
   combination of two factors: (a) soil acidification that depleted calcium
   and impaired root function and (b) earlier onset of the growing season
   that further taxed the root system. The latter change in phenology
   appears to act as a trigger at both sites to push trees into nutrient
   limitation as the demand for Ca increased with the longer growing
   season, thereby causing the shift in carbon allocation.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative genetic theory provides a means of estimating the
   evolutionary potential of natural populations. However, this approach
   was previously only feasible in systems where the genetic relatedness
   between individuals could be inferred from pedigrees or experimental
   crosses. The genomic revolution opened up the possibility of obtaining
   the realized proportion of genome shared among individuals in natural
   populations of virtually any species, which could promise (more)
   accurate estimates of quantitative genetic parameters in virtually any
   species. Such a `genomic' quantitative genetics approach relies on fewer
   assumptions, offers a greater methodological flexibility, and is thus
   expected to greatly enhance our understanding of evolution in natural

Abstract = {{A simplistic view of the adaptive process pictures a hillside along
   which a population can climb: when ecological `demands' change,
   evolution `supplies' the variation needed for the population to climb to
   a new peak. Evolutionary ecologists point out that this simplistic view
   can be incomplete because the fitness landscape changes dynamically as
   the population evolves. Geneticists meanwhile have identified
   complexities relating to the nature of genetic varia-tion and its
   architecture, and the importance of epigenetic variation is under
   debate. In this review, we highlight how complexity in both ecological
   `demands' and the evolutionary `supply' influences organisms' ability to
   climb fitness landscapes that themselves change dynamically as evolution
   proceeds, and encourage new synthetic effort across research disciplines
   towards eco-logically realistic studies of adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Most experimental evidence on the relationship between biodiversity and
   ecosystem functioning comes from ecosystems with fast-growing plants,
   such as grasslands. Although forests provide essential ecological
   services, they have been less well investigated. We used
   dendrochronology to compare the tree radial growth rates of four
   important timber species in replicated, spatially mapped stands that
   differed in tree composition and diversity within a central European
   managed forest. Growth rates differed among species but were largely
   unaffected by the density of neighbouring trees. Increasing stand
   diversity enhanced individual growth rates, after accounting for the
   effects of tree density and size. These increases were statistically
   indistinguishable among the four species. In contrast, the effects of
   stand and neighbourhood species composition on growth rates were
   non-significant.Policy implications. Our study of long-established
   central European forest stands revealed levels of tree diversity can be
   increased in managed forests, with the potential for modest increases in
   tree growth rates. These results suggest that in addition to the
   biodiversity and risk mitigation benefits associated with shifting
   practices away from monoculture management, increased carbon
   sequestration and yields in mature forests are likely to be realized.
   Our results suggest that it is possible to increase forest diversity
   with little or no costs to production and even with the potential for
   modest increases in tree growth rates.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Aims Litterfall, as an important link between aboveground and
   below-ground processes, plays a key role in forest ecosystems. Here, we
   test for effects of tree species richness on litter production and
   litter quality in subtropical forest. The study further encompasses a
   factorial gradient of secondary succession that resulted from human
   exploitation. Given that a large percentage of subtropical forests are
   in secondary successional stages, understanding the role of biodiversity
   on forest re-growth after disturbance appears critical.
   Methods From January 2009 to December 2014, we monitored forest
   litterfall in 27 Comparative Study Plots that spanned a gradient of tree
   species richness (3-20 species) and secondary successional ages (similar
   to 20 to 120 years) in Gutianshan Natural Nature Reserve, Zhejiang
   Province, China. The experiment is part of the biodiversity-ecosystem
   functioning research platform `BEF-China'. Tree litterfall was collected
   in monthly intervals using litter traps. Samples were separated into
   leaf and non-leaf components. Leaf litter was further sorted into
   dominant and other species. Community level monthly leaf litter C and N
   contents were analysed through a full year. General linear mixed-effects
   models were applied to test for effects of tree species richness and
   successional age on litter quantity and leaf litter C/N.
   Important Findings Litterfall increased with species richness among and
   within successional age and this effect was consistent across years.
   Successionally older stands had higher litterfall and this effect was
   related to increased tree species richness. However, species richness
   did not change the intra-and inter-annual temporal stability of
   litterfall. Increasing tree species richness increased leaf litter
   quality (decreased C/N), while successional age had no effect. Our study
   indicates that more diverse forest stands produce more leaf litter and
   that this litter has higher N concentrations, which could promote forest
   growth through accelerated nutrient re-cycling.}},

Abstract = {{There is a large diversity of genetically defined resistance genes in
   bread wheat against the powdery mildew pathogen Blumeria graminis (B.g.)
   f. sp.tritici. Many confer race-specific resistance to this pathogen,
   but until now only the mildew avirulence gene AvrPm3(a2/f2) that is
   recognized by Pm3a/f was known molecularly. We performed map-based
   cloning and genome-wide association studies to isolate a candidate for
   the mildew avirulence gene AvrPm2. We then used transient expression
   assays in Nicotiana benthamiana to demonstrate specific and strong
   recognition of AvrPm2 by Pm2. The virulent AvrPm2 allele arose from a
   conserved 12kb deletion, while there is no protein sequence diversity in
   the gene pool of avirulent B.g.tritici isolates. We found one
   polymorphic AvrPm2 allele in B.g.triticale and one orthologue in
   B.g.secalis and both are recognized by Pm2. AvrPm2 belongs to a small
   gene family encoding structurally conserved RNase-like effectors,
   including Avr(a13) from B.g.hordei, the cognate Avr of the barley
   resistance gene Mla13. These results demonstrate the conservation of
   functional avirulence genes in two cereal powdery mildews specialized on
   different hosts, thus providing a possible explanation for successful
   introgression of resistance genes from rye or other grass relatives to
   wheat.}},

Abstract = {{Emphasizing the physical intricacies of integrated hydrology and
   feedbacks in simulating connected, variably saturated
   groundwater-surface water systems, the Integrated Hydrologic Model
   Intercomparison Project initiated a second phase (IH-MIP2), increasing
   the complexity of the benchmarks of the first phase. The models that
   took part in the intercomparison were ATS, Cast3M, CATHY, GEOtop,
   HydroGeoSphere, MIKE-SHE, and ParFlow. IH-MIP2 benchmarks included a
   tilted v-catchment with 3-D subsurface; a superslab case expanding the
   slab case of the first phase with an additional horizontal subsurface
   heterogeneity; and the Borden field rainfall-runoff experiment. The
   analyses encompassed time series of saturated, unsaturated, and ponded
   storages, as well as discharge. Vertical cross sections and profiles
   were also inspected in the superslab and Borden benchmarks. An analysis
   of agreement was performed including systematic and unsystematic
   deviations between the different models. Results show generally good
   agreement between the different models, which lends confidence in the
   fundamental physical and numerical implementation of the governing
   equations in the different models. Differences can be attributed to the
   varying level of detail in the mathematical and numerical representation
   or in the parameterization of physical processes, in particular with
   regard to ponded storage and friction slope in the calculation of
   overland flow. These differences may become important for specific
   applications such as detailed inundation modeling or when strong
   inhomogeneities are present in the simulation domain.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely recognized that ecological dynamics influence evolutionary
   dynamics, and conversely that evolutionary changes alter ecological
   processes. Because fragmentation impacts all biological levels (from
   individuals to ecosystems) through isolation and reduced habitat size,
   it strongly affects the links among evolutionary and ecological
   processes such as population dynamics, local adaptation, dispersal and
   speciation. Here, we review our current knowledge of the
   eco-evolutionary dynamics in fragmented landscapes, focusing on both
   theory and experimental studies. We then suggest future experimental
   directions to study eco-evolutionary dynamics and/or feedbacks in
   fragmented landscapes, especially to bridge the gap between theoretical
   predictions and experimental validations.}},

Title = {{High-Throughput Non-destructive Phenotyping of Traits that Contribute to
   Salinity Tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Reproducible and efficient high-throughput phenotyping approaches,
   combined with advances in genome sequencing, are facilitating the
   discovery of genes affecting plant performance. Salinity tolerance is a
   desirable trait that can be achieved through breeding, where most have
   aimed at selecting for plants that perform effective ion exclusion from
   the shoots. To determine overall plant performance under salt stress, it
   is helpful to investigate several plant traits collectively in one
   experimental setup. Hence, we developed a quantitative phenotyping
   protocol using a high-throughput phenotyping system, with RGB and
   chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) imaging, which captures the growth,
   morphology, color and photosynthetic performance of Arabidopsis thaliana
   plants in response to salt stress. We optimized our salt treatment by
   controlling the soil-water content prior to introducing salt stress. We
   investigated these traits over time in two accessions in soil at 150,
   100, or 50 mM NaCl to find that the plants subjected to 100 mM NaCl
   showed the most prominent responses in the absence of symptoms of severe
   stress. In these plants, salt stress induced significant changes in
   rosette area and morphology, but less prominent changes in rosette
   coloring and photosystem II efficiency. Clustering of ChIF traits with
   plant growth of nine accessions maintained at 100 mM NaCl revealed that
   in the early stage of salt stress, salinity tolerance correlated with
   non-photochemical quenching processes and during the later stage, plant
   performance correlated with quantum yield. This integrative approach
   allows the simultaneous analysis of several phenotypic traits. In
   combination with various genetic resources, the phenotyping protocol
   described here is expected to increase our understanding of plant
   performance and stress responses, ultimately identifying genes that
   improve plant performance in salt stress conditions.}},

   exposure to glacial lake outburst floods}},
Journal = {{Environmental Research Letters}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Himalayan water resources attract a rapidly growing number of
   hydroelectric power projects (HPP) to satisfy Asia's soaring energy
   demands. Yet HPP operating or planned in steep, glacier-fed mountain
   rivers face hazards of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) that can
   damage hydropower infrastructure, alter water and sediment yields, and
   compromise livelihoods downstream. Detailed appraisals of such GLOF
   hazards are limited to case studies, however, and a more comprehensive,
   systematic analysis remains elusive. To this end we estimate the
   regional exposure of 257 Himalayan HPP to GLOFs, using a flood-wave
   propagation model fed by Monte Carlo-derived outburst volumes of >2300
   glacial lakes. We interpret the spread of thus modeled peak discharges
   as a predictive uncertainty that arises mainly from outburst volumes and
   dam-breach rates that are difficult to assess before dams fail. With
   66\% of sampled HPP are on potential GLOF tracks, up to one third of
   these HPP could experience GLOF discharges well above local design
   floods, as hydropower development continues to seek higher sites closer
   to glacial lakes. We compute that this systematic push of HPP into
   headwaters effectively doubles the uncertainty about GLOF peak discharge
   in these locations. Peak discharges farther downstream, in contrast, are
   easier to predict because GLOF waves attenuate rapidly. Considering this
   systematic pattern of regional GLOF exposure might aid the site
   selection of future Himalayan HPP. Our method can augment, and help to
   regularly update, current hazard assessments, given that global warming
   is likely changing the number and size of Himalayan meltwater lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The mutualism between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is
   widespread and has persisted for over 400 million years. Although this
   mutualism depends on fair resource exchange between plants and fungi,
   inequality exists among partners despite mechanisms that regulate trade.
   Here, we use P-33 and C-14 isotopes and a split-root system to test for
   preferential allocation and reciprocal rewards in the plant-AMF
   symbiosis by presenting a plant with two AMF that differ in
   cooperativeness. We found that plants received more P-33 from less
   cooperative AMF in the presence of another AMF species. This increase in
   P-33 resulted in a reduced C-14 cost per unit of P-33 from less
   cooperative AMF when alternative options were available. Our results
   indicate that AMF diversity promotes cooperation between plants and AMF,
   which may be an important mechanism maintaining the evolutionary
   persistence of and diversity within the plant-AMF mutualism.}},

Abstract = {{Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) SPINDLY (SPY) is a putative serine
   and threonine O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT). While SPY
   has been shown to suppress gibberellin signaling and to promote
   cytokinin (CK) responses, its catalytic OGT activity was never
   demonstrated and its effect on protein fate is not known. We previously
   showed that SPY interacts physically and functionally with TCP14 and
   TCP15 to promote CK responses. Here, we aimed to identify how SPY
   regulates TCP14/15 activities and how these TCPs promote CK responses.
   We show that SPY activity is required for TCP14 stability. Mutation in
   the putative OGT domain of SPY (spy-3) stimulated TCP14 proteolysis by
   the 26S proteasome, which was reversed by mutation in CULLIN1 (CUL1),
   suggesting a role for SKP, CUL1, F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase in TCP14
   proteolysis. TCP14 proteolysis in spy-3 suppressed all TCP14
   misexpression phenotypes, including the enhanced CK responses. The
   increased CK activity in TCP14/15-overexpressing flowers resulted from
   increased sensitivity to the hormone and not from higher CK levels.
   TCP15 overexpression enhanced the response of the CK-induced synthetic
   promoter pTCS to CK, suggesting that TCP14/15 affect early steps in CK
   signaling. We propose that posttranslational modification of TCP14/15 by
   SPY inhibits their proteolysis and that the accumulated proteins promote
   the activity of the CK phosphorelay cascade in developing Arabidopsis
   leaves and flowers.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Apocynaceae and Orchidaceae are two angiosperm
   families with extreme flower synorganization. They are unrelated, the
   former in eudicots, the latter in monocots, but they converge in the
   formation of pollinia and pollinaria, which do not occur in any other
   angiosperm family, and for which extreme synorganization of floral
   organs is a precondition. In each family extensive studies on flower
   development and evolution have been performed; however, newer
   comparative studies focusing on flower synorganization and involving
   both families together are lacking.
   Scope For this study an extensive search through the morphological
   literature has been conducted. Based on this and my own studies on
   flowers in various Apocynaceae and Orchidaceae and complex flowers in
   other angiosperms with scanning electron microscopy and with microtome
   section series, a review on convergent floral traits in flower
   development and architecture in the two families is presented.
   Key Findings There is a tendency of protracted development of
   synorganized parts in Apocynaceae and Orchidaceae (development of
   synorganization of two or more organs begins earlier the more
   accentuated it is at anthesis). Synorganization (or complexity) also
   paves the way for novel structures. One of the most conspicuous such
   novel structures in Apocynaceae is the corona, which is not the product
   of synorganization of existing organs; however, it is probably enhanced
   by synorganization of other, existing, floral parts. In contrast to
   synorganized parts, the corona appears developmentally late.
   Conclusions Synorganization of floral organs may lead to a large number
   of convergences in clades that are only very distantly related. The
   convergences that have been highlighted in this comparative study should
   be developmentally investigated directly in parallel in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{In alpine environments facilitator species buffer environmental extremes
   while building up soil resources above that of open areas. These
   modulating effects are critical for the persistence of species out of
   their optimal range and contribute to increase community-level plant
   species richness and phylogenetic diversity. We analyzed the effects of
   seven potential facilitator species with contrasting morphologies on
   subordinate plant species along a crossed environmental gradient,
   linking such effects to canopy effects. We also used these patches
   consisting of multiple shrub species to evaluate the effects of the
   whole shrub community on species richness and phylogenetic diversity,
   and whether such shrub community effects differed along the gradient. We
   used ecological and phylogenetic data of alpine plant communities along
   two altitudinal gradients on opposing aspects of the Sierra Nevada
   Mountains (Spain). As expected, shrubs buffered harsh abiotic conditions
   by decreasing mean temperatures and increasing relative humidity with
   regard to open areas. Composition of subordinate plant communities
   differed among shrubs and among sites, and correlated with relative
   humidity along the gradient pointing to the dependence of subordinate
   species on micro-environments created by shrubs. There were a variety of
   shrub effects on overall plant abundance and richness depending on shrub
   identity. In the most extreme sites we recorded generally positive
   effects of the shrub community, which promoted whole-community species
   richness and phylogenetic diversity despite species-specific effects
   ranging from clearly negative to positive. Our data therefore show that
   the effect of different shrub species on plant community richness and
   phylogenetic diversity is not redundant, as every shrub species may host
   unique communities, thereby affecting the structure and composition of
   the whole community. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

   Primary Production and NDVI: A Model-Data Comparison}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The net primary productivity (NPP) is commonly used for understanding
   the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems and their role in carbon cycle.
   We used a combination of the most recent NDVI and model-based NPP
   estimates (from five models of the TRENDY project) for the period
   1982-2012, to study the role of terrestrial ecosystems in carbon cycle
   under the prevailing climate conditions. We found that 80\% and 67\% of
   the global land area showed positive NPP and NDVI values, respectively,
   for this period. The global NPP was estimated to be about 63 Pg C center
   dot y(-1), with an increase of 0.214 Pg C center dot y(-1)center dot
   y(-1). Similarly, the global mean NDVI was estimated to be 0.33, with an
   increasing trend of 0.00041 y(-1). The spatial patterns of NPP and NDVI
   demonstrated substantial variability, especially at the regional level,
   for most part of the globe. However, on temporal scale, both global NPP
   and NDVI showed a corresponding pattern of increase (decrease) for the
   duration of this study except for few years (e.g., 1990 and 1995-1998).
   Generally, the Northern Hemisphere showed stronger NDVI and NPP
   increasing trends over time compared to the Southern Hemisphere;
   however, NDVI showed larger trends in Temperate regions while NPP showed
   larger trends in Boreal regions. Among the five models, the maximum and
   minimum NPP were produced by JULES (72.4 Pg C center dot y(-1)) and LPJ
   (53.72 Pg C center dot y(-1)) models, respectively. At latitudinal
   level, the NDVI and NPP ranges were similar to 0.035 y(-1) to similar
   to-0.016 y(-1) and similar to 0.10 Pg C center dot y(-1)center dot y(-1)
   to similar to-0.047 Pg C center dot y(-1)center dot y(-1), respectively.
   Overall, the results of this study suggest that the modeled NPP
   generally correspond to the NDVI trends in the temporal dimension. The
   significant variability in spatial patterns of NPP and NDVI trends
   points to a need for research to understand the causes of these
   discrepancies between molded and observed ecosystem dynamics, and the
   carbon cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity in fitness components consists of fixed heterogeneity due
   to latent differences fixed throughout life (e.g., genetic variation)
   and dynamic heterogeneity generated by stochastic variation. Their
   relative magnitude is crucial for evolutionary processes, as only the
   former may allow for adaptation. However, the importance of fixed
   heterogeneity in small populations has recently been questioned. Using
   neutral simulations (NS), several studies failed to detect fixed
   heterogeneity, thus challenging previous results from mixed models (MM).
   To understand the causes of this discrepancy, we estimate the
   statistical power and false positive rate of both methods and apply them
   to empirical data from a wild rodent population. While MM show high
   false-positive rates if confounding factors are not accounted for, they
   have high statistical power to detect real fixed heterogeneity. In
   contrast, NS are also subject to high false-positive rates but always
   have low power. Indeed, MM analyses of the rodent population data show
   significant fixed heterogeneity in reproductive success, whereas NS
   analyses do not. We suggest that fixed heterogeneity may be more common
   than is suggested by NS and that NS are useful only if more powerful
   methods are not applicable and if they are complemented by a power
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of genetic diversity in fitness-related traits remains a
   central topic in evolutionary biology, for example, in the context of
   sexual selection for genetic benefits. Among the solutions that have
   been proposed is directional sexual selection for heterozygosity. The
   importance of such selection is highly debated. However, a critical
   evaluation requires knowledge of the heritability of heterozygosity, a
   quantity that is rarely estimated in this context, and often assumed to
   be zero. This is at least partly the result of the lack of a general
   framework that allows for its quantitative prediction in small and
   inbred populations, which are the focus of most empirical studies.
   Moreover, while current predictors are applicable only to biallelic
   loci, fitness-relevant loci are often multiallelic, as are the neutral
   markers typically used to estimate genome-wide heterozygosity. To this
   end, we first review previous, but little-known, work showing that under
   most circumstances, heterozygosity at biallelic loci and in the absence
   of inbreeding is heritable. We then derive the heritability of
   heterozygosity and the underlying variances for multiple alleles and any
   inbreeding level. We also show that heterozygosity at multiallelic loci
   can be highly heritable when allele frequencies are unequal, and that
   this heritability is reduced by inbreeding. Our quantitative genetic
   framework can provide new insights into the evolutionary dynamics of
   heterozygosity in inbred and outbred populations.}},

Abstract = {{New morphological and phylogenetic data prompt us to present an updated
   review of floral morphology and its evolution in the basal ANITA grade
   of living angiosperms, Chloranthaceae, and Ceratophyllum. Floral
   phyllotaxis is complex whorled in Nymphaeales and spiral in Amborella
   and Austrobaileyales. It is unresolved whether phyllotaxis was
   ancestrally whorled or spiral, but if it was whorled, the whorls were
   trimerous. The flowers are probably ancestrally bisexual because in most
   families with unisexual flowers these flowers exhibit rudiments of the
   opposite sex. Carpels are largely ascidiate and the closure line is
   short, either transverse or longitudinal. A style is usually absent or,
   if present, generally short and not plicate. Angiospermy (carpel
   sealing) is by secretion, rather than postgenital fusion, except in
   large-flowered Nymphaeales and in Illicium, correlated with unusual
   fruits. Carpels with a single, median, pendent ovule are probably
   plesiomorphic. Chloranthaceae and Ceratophyllaceae have an unsettled
   phylogenetic position, but in some phylogenetic analyses they form a
   clade, which may be sister to the remaining mesangiosperms (Magnoliidae,
   monocots, eudicots). This position is supported by their carpel
   characters, which are similar to those of the ANITA grade and different
   from those of most other mesangiosperms.}},

Title = {{Losses and use efficiencies along the phosphorus cycle - Part 2:
   Understanding the concept of efficiency}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{Part 1 of this paper showed that losses and efficiencies are highly
   similar concepts used to valuate the quality of a production process
   from an input-output economics perspective. Both concepts are useful in
   methods that aim to reduce the amount of input (money, material, labor,
   etc.) needed to get a certain desired output. Yet, from a
   decision-theoretic perspective, both concepts are secondary. They are
   subordinate to the desired goal, product, or service, i.e., the
   efficacy, and the overall impacts on a tangible system, i.e.,
   effectiveness (which we consider as an overall utility) and are of
   superior importance to an action or a decision.
   Part 2 provides an in-depth discussion of efficiency. We show that we
   need an overall objective (a kind of total utility), such as
   effectiveness or resilience, as a target variable for sustainable
   resource use. Efficiency is a valuation function that assesses how much
   we have to invest in order to receive a certain quantity and/or quality
   of a desired outcome or product. We conceive of effectiveness as the
   capability of an action, decision, or technology to attain a meaningful
   and satisfying overall result (with respect to a specific
   perspective/interest or overall objective). We further shed light on
   several misperceived relationships between efficacy and efficiency. Both
   material/technical and economic efficiency can be defined as a fraction
   of two variables, i.e., the ratio between input and output. Here, the
   nominator (i.e., the output) is usually what we consider as efficacy.
   For the agro-use of P (and many organismic systems), the
   material-biophysical output is not linearly related to the input, but we
   are facing the Law of Marginal Diminishing Returns (which contrasts with
   the Tayloristic idea that increasing throughput increases efficiency).
   Thus, unrealistic expectations and misperceptions may emerge. We
   exemplarily discuss and substantiate by theoretical and data-based
   arguments why the objective to ``increase global P nutrient use
   efficiency by 30\% and the outcome of yield by 30\%{''} is not possible
   in the next decades as the antagonistic relationship between efficacy
   and efficiency and the diverging options in different countries and
   world regions are ignored. Finally, we briefly illuminate in what way
   the evaluation of phosphorus management may be considered sustainable
   and what rebound effects may be mastered. This is done by discussing
   system boundaries, evaluation perspectives, and the factors discussed in
   the context of efficacy, efficiency, and effectiveness. (C) 2015

Title = {{Imaging spectroscopy to assess the composition of ice surface materials

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{388-402}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Glacier surfaces are not only composed of ice or snow but are
   heterogeneous mixtures of different materials. The occurrence and
   dynamics of light-absorbing impurities affect ice surface
   characteristics and strongly influence glacier melt processes. However,
   our understanding of the spatial distribution of impurities and their
   impact on ice surface characteristics and the glacier's energy budget is
   still limited. We use imaging spectroscopy in combination with in-situ
   experiments to assess the composition of ice surface materials and their
   respective impact on surface albedo and glacier melt rates. Spectroscopy
   data were acquired in August 2013 using the Airborne Prism EXperiment
   (APEX) imaging spectrometer and were used to map the abundances of six
   predominant surface materials on Glacier de la Plaine Morte, Swiss Alps.
   A pixel-based classification revealed that about 10\% of the ice surface
   is covered with snow, water or debris. The remaining 90\% of the surface
   can be divided into three types of glacier ice, namely similar to 7\%
   dirty ice, similar to 43\% pure ice and similar to 39\% bright ice.
   Spatially distributed spectral albedo derived from APEX reflectance data
   in combination with in-situ multi-angular spectroscopic measurements was
   used to analyse albedo patterns present on the glacier surface. About
   85\% of all pixels exhibit a low albedo between 0.1 and 0.4 (mean albedo
   029 +/- 0.12), indicating that Glacier de la Plaine Morte is covered
   with a significant amount of light-absorbing impurities, resulting in a
   strong ice-albedo feedback during the ablation season. Using a
   pixel-based albedo map instead of a constant albedo for ice (0.34) as
   input for a mass balance model revealed that the glacier-wide total
   ablation remained similar (10\% difference). However, the large local
   variations in mass balance can only be reproduced using the pixel-based
   albedo derived from APEX, emphasizing the need to quantify spatial
   albedo differences as an important input for glacier mass balance
   models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Floods are governed by largely varying processes and thus exhibit
   various behaviors. Classification of flood events into flood types and
   the determination of their respective frequency is therefore important
   for a better understanding and prediction of floods. This study presents
   a flood classification for identifying flood patterns at a catchment
   scale by means of a fuzzy decision tree. Hence, events are represented
   as a spectrum of six main possible flood types that are attributed with
   their degree of acceptance. Considered types are flash, short rainfall,
   long rainfall, snow-melt, rainfall on snow and, in high alpine
   catchments, glacier-melt floods. The fuzzy decision tree also makes it
   possible to acknowledge the uncertainty present in the identification of
   flood processes and thus allows for more reliable flood class estimates
   than using a crisp decision tree, which identifies one flood type per
   event. Based on the data set in nine Swiss mountainous catchments, it
   was demonstrated that this approach is less sensitive to uncertainties
   in the classification attributes than the classical crisp approach.
   These results show that the fuzzy approach bears additional potential
   for analyses of flood patterns at a catchment scale and thereby it
   provides more realistic representation of flood processes.}},

Abstract = {{Polyploidization is a rare yet sometimes successful way for animals to
   rapidly create geno- and phenotypes that may colonize new habitats and
   quickly adapt to environmental changes. In this study, we use water
   frogs of the Pelophylax esculentus complex, comprising two species
   (Pelophylax lessonae, genotype LL; Pelophylax ridibundus, RR) and
   various diploid (LR) and triploid (LLR, LRR) hybrid forms, summarized as
   P.esculentus, as a model for studying recent hybridization and
   polyploidization in the context of speciation. Specifically, we compared
   the geographic distribution and genetic diversity of diploid and
   triploid hybrids across Europe to understand their origin, maintenance
   and potential role in hybrid speciation. We found that different hybrid
   and parental genotypes are not evenly distributed across Europe. Rather,
   their genetic diversity is structured by latitude and longitude and the
   presence/absence of parental species but not of triploids. Highest
   genetic diversity was observed in central and eastern Europe, the lowest
   in the northwestern parts of Europe. This gradient can be explained by
   the decrease in genetic diversity during postglacial expansion from
   southeastern glacial refuge areas. Genealogical relationships calculated
   on the basis of microsatellite data clearly indicate that hybrids are of
   multiple origin and include a huge variety of parental genomes. Water
   frogs in mixed-ploidy populations without any parental species (i.e.
   all-hybrid populations) can be viewed as evolutionary units that may be
   on their way towards hybrid speciation. Maintenance of such all-hybrid
   populations requires a continuous exchange of genomes between diploids
   and triploids, but scenarios for alternative evolutionary trajectories
   are discussed.}},

   measure species interactions.
   2. We compared four methods to measure and express species interactions.
   These approaches are, with increasing degree of model complexity, an
   extinction-based model, a relative yield model and two generalized
   Lotka-Volterra (LV) models. All four approaches have been individually
   applied in different fields of community ecology, but rarely integrated.
   We provide an overview of the definitions, assumptions and data needed
   for the specific methods and apply them to empirical data by
   experimentally deriving the interaction matrices among 11 protist and
   rotifer species, belonging to three functional groups. Furthermore, we
   compare their advantages and limitations to predict multispecies
   community dynamics and ecosystem functioning.
   3. The relative yield method is, in terms of final biomass production,
   the best method in predicting the 11-species community dynamics from the
   pairwise competition experiments. The LV model, which is considering
   equilibrium among the species, suffers from experimental constraints
   given the strict equilibrium assumption, and this may be rarely
   satisfied in ecological communities.
   4. We show how simulations of a LV stochastic community model, derived
   from an empirical interaction matrix, can be used to predict
   multispecies community dynamics across multiple functional groups.
   5.Our work unites available tools to measure species interactions under
   one framework. This improves our ability to make management-oriented
   predictions of species coexistence/extinction and to compare ecosystem
   processes across study systems.}},

   review the theoretical context behind and major policies outcomes of
   this reform process, and offer an initial assessment of its
   operationalization. We conclude that the `conflict minerals' approach is
   at a critical juncture, caught between the need to deliver a reliable

Abstract = {{The end-Permian mass extinction resulted in the most dramatic
   degradation of marine bottom communities during the Phanerozoic. One
   result of this extinction was the long-recognized, extreme reduction in
   bioturbation of the Early Triassic seafloor. Several lines of evidence
   (i.e., preferential preservation of epifaunal and very shallow-tier
   infaunal trace fossils; paucity of mid- and deep-tier trace fossils;
   absence of mottled bioturbation textures; dominance of cohesive
   substrates; widespread occurrence of microbially induced sedimentary
   structures in open-marine environments; ecological composition of Early
   Triassic communities) show that the reduction in bioturbation was so
   extreme that the sedimentary mixed layer was eradicated at an
   interregional scale for the only time since it was established in the
   early Palaeozoic. The consequences of this for ecosystem function and
   geochemical cycling must have been profound and yet they have received
   little consideration. Biogenic mixing of sediments is fundamental to
   geochemical cycling in extant marine ecosystems, and it also governs
   ecologically limiting factors such as nutrient fluxes, benthic primary
   production, and availability of ecospace. The collapse of biogenic
   sediment mixing during the Early Triassic must have affected geochemical
   properties of sediments and the seawater, as reflected in the geologic
   record of the sulphur cycle. Additionally, many of the proxies
   traditionally used to infer Early Triassic seawater anoxia may rather
   reflect poor sediment oxygenation arising from the extinction of
   bioturbators. Because of its impact on seawater and sediment chemistry,
   the loss of the mixed layer may have been an important, but hitherto
   little-considered constraint on the recovery from the end-Permian mass
   extinction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural rates of soil production or a target soil thickness that allows
   unrestricted land use can serve as a basis for defining tolerable soil
   erosion rates. Guidelines for tolerable soil erosion rates in alpine
   grasslands do not yet exist, partly due to the lack of information of
   soil formation and production rates. We (i) defined soil
   formation/production rates for alpine grasslands on siliceous lithology
   and compared them to measured and modelled soil erosion rates and
   resulting soil thickness with a special focus on the Urseren Valley
   (Central Swiss Alps) and (ii) discussed possible trends for alpine soils
   under global change.
   Ranges of soil formation, production and erosion rates were determined
   using published and our own data for Alpine grasslands soils. Two
   definitions of tolerable erosion rate were used: when (i) current soil
   depth remains constant over time; and (ii) at least a minimum soil depth
   is maintained (minimum thicknesses for individual land uses still need
   to be defined).
   Soil production and related tolerable erosion rates (i.e. 50-90 \% of
   the soil production rate) are a strong function of time. Average soil
   production rate in alpine areas for relatively old soils (> 10-18 kyr)
   is between 54 (+/- 14) and 113 (+/- 30) t km(-2) year(-1), for young
   soils (> 1-10 kyr) between 119 (+/- 44) and 248 (+/- 91) t km(-2)
   year(-1) and for very young soils (a parts per thousand currency sign1
   kyr) between 415 (+/- 242) and 881 (+/- 520) t km(-2) year(-1). Measured
   recent soil erosion rates in alpine areas at intensively used slopes
   range from 600 to 3000 t km(-2) year(-1). Average catchment values for
   the Urseren Valley using the model USLE plus soil loss due to landslides
   resulted in an overall loss of 180 t km(-2) year(-1), which considerably
   exceeds production rates of the soils.
   The comparison of soil production and erosion rates indicated
   unsustainable management of grassland soils in the Urseren Valley. Other
   Alpine regions report similar or even higher erosion rates.
   Consequently, attention has to be paid to Alpine grasslands used for
   agricultural purposes because today's soil erosion rates often
   considerably exceed soil formation, thus resulting in very shallow
   soils. Future global change is likely to increase soil erosion rates
   even further.}},

Abstract = {{Telomeres are protective DNA-protein complexes located at the ends of
   eukaryotic chromosomes, whose length has been shown to predict
   life-history parameters in various species. Although this suggests that
   telomere length is subject to natural selection, its evolutionary
   dynamics crucially depends on its heritability. Using pedigree data for
   a population of white-throated dippers (Cinclus cinclus), we test
   whether and how variation in early-life relative telomere length (RTL,
   measured as the number of telomeric repeats relative to a control gene
   using qPCR) is transmitted across generations. We disentangle the
   relative effects of genes and environment and test for sex-specific
   patterns of inheritance. There was strong and significant resemblance
   among offspring sharing the same nest and offspring of the same cohort.
   Furthermore, although offspring resemble their mother, and there is some
   indication for an effect of inbreeding, additive genetic variance and
   heritability are close to zero. We find no evidence for a role of either
   maternal imprinting or Z-linked inheritance in generating these
   patterns, suggesting they are due to non-genetic maternal and common
   environment effects instead. We conclude that in this wild bird
   population, environmental factors are the main drivers of variation in
   early-life RTL, which will severely bias estimates of heritability when
   not modelled explicitly.}},

Abstract = {{Successful invasions by sexually reproducing species depend on the
   ability of individuals to mate. Finding mates can be particularly
   challenging at low densities (a mate-finding Allee effect), a factor
   that is only implicitly accounted for by most invasion models, which
   typically assume asexual populations. Existing theory on single-sex
   populations suggests that dispersal evolution in the presence of
   amate-finding Allee effect slows invasions. Here we develop a two-sex
   model to determine how mating system, strength of an Allee effect, and
   dispersal evolution influence invasion speed. We show that mating system
   differences can dramatically alter the spread rate. We also find a
   broader spectrum of outcomes than earlier work suggests. Allowing
   dispersal to evolve in a spreading context can sometimes alleviate the
   mate-finding Allee effect and slow the rate of spread. However, we
   demonstrate the opposite when resource competition among females remains
   high: evolution then acts to speed up the spread rate, despite
   simultaneously exacerbating the Allee effect. Our results highlight the
   importance of the timing of mating relative to dispersal and the
   strength of resource competition for consideration in future empirical
   studies.}},

Title = {{Are tetraploids more successful? Floral signals, reproductive success
   and floral isolation in mixed-ploidy populations of a terrestrial orchid}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Polyploidization, the doubling of chromosome sets,
   is common in angiosperms and has a range of evolutionary consequences.
   Newly formed polyploid lineages are reproductively isolated from their
   diploid progenitors due to triploid sterility, but also prone to
   extinction because compatible mating partners are rare. Models have
   suggested that assortative mating and increased reproductive fitness
   play a key role in the successful establishment and persistence of
   polyploids. However, little is known about these factors in natural
   mixed-ploidy populations. This study investigated floral traits that can
   affect pollinator attraction and efficiency, as well as reproductive
   success in diploid and tetraploid Gymnadenia conopsea (Orchidaceae)
   plants in two natural, mixed-ploidy populations.
   Methods Ploidy levels were determined using flow cytometry, and
   flowering phenology and herbivory were also assessed. Reproductive
   success was determined by counting fruits and viable seeds of marked
   plants. Pollinator-mediated floral isolation was measured using
   experimental arrays, with pollen flow tracked by means of staining
   pollinia with histological dye.
   Key Results Tetraploids had larger floral displays and different floral
   scent bouquets than diploids, but cytotypes differed only slightly in
   floral colour. Significant floral isolation was found between the two
   cytotypes. Flowering phenology of the two cytotypes greatly overlapped,
   and herbivory did not differ between cytotypes or was lower in
   tetraploids. In addition, tetraploids had higher reproductive success
   compared with diploids.
   Conclusions The results suggest that floral isolation and increased
   reproductive success of polyploids may help to explain their successful
   persistence in mixed-ploidy populations. These factors might even
   initiate transformation of populations from pure diploid to pure
   tetraploid.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Northern Tien Shan is characterised by a distinct periglacial belt that
   contains many rock glaciers with an area of 1km(2) or more. To
   investigate the reason for their large size and variable occurrence, we
   analysed a representative subsample of the rock glaciers with respect to
   topographic and climatic variables. A simple permafrost model indicates
   that the rock glaciers originate in the zone where permafrost occurrence
   is very likely and some large rock glaciers flow down to elevations
   where permafrost is unlikely to exist outside the rock glaciers
   themselves. Correlation and multiple regression analyses revealed that
   the occurrence and characteristics of the rock glaciers can only be
   partly explained by the characteristics of the contributing area (e.g.
   its area or the headwall height). The correlation is greater with
   talus-type rock glaciers than with moraine-type rock glaciers. The
   climate can explain the general occurrence of rock glaciers but not
   their specific characteristics. It is hypothesised that the main reason
   for the specific distribution and characteristics of these large rock
   glaciers relates to the interaction with polythermal glaciers,
   topographic characteristics, intensive weathering and rock avalanches
   triggered by seismic activity. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Maternal hormones are important mediators of prenatal maternal effects.
   Although many experimental studies have demonstrated their potency in
   shaping offspring phenotypes, we know remarkably little about their
   adaptive value. Using long-term data on a wild collared flycatcher
   (Ficedula albicollis) population, we show that natural selection acts in
   opposite ways on two maternally derived androgens, yolk androstenedione
   (A4) and yolk testosterone (T). High yolk A4 concentrations are
   associated with higher fitness, whereas high yolk T concentrations are
   associated with lower fitness. Natural selection thus favours females
   that produce eggs with high A4 and low T concentrations. Importantly,
   however, there exists a positive (non-genetic) correlation between A4
   and T, which suggests that females are limited in their ability to reach
   this adaptive optimum. Thereby, these results provide strong evidence
   for an adaptive value of differential maternal androgen deposition, and
   a mechanistic explanation for the maintenance of variation in maternal
   investment in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial cooperation typically consists in the sharing of secreted
   metabolites (referred to as public goods) within the community. Although
   public goods generally promote population growth, they are also
   vulnerable to exploitation by cheating mutants, which no longer
   contribute, but still benefit from the public goods produced by others.
   Although previous studies have identified a number of key factors that
   prevent the spreading of cheaters, little is known about how these
   factors interact and jointly shape the evolution of microbial
   cooperation. Here, we address this issue by investigating the
   interaction effects of cell diffusion, cell density, public good
   diffusion and durability (factors known to individually influence costs
   and benefits of public goods production) on selection for cooperation.
   To be able to quantify these effects across a wide parameter space, we
   developed an individual-based simulation platform, consisting of digital
   cooperator and cheater bacteria inhabiting a finite two-dimensional
   continuous toroidal surface. Our simulations, which closely mimic
   microbial microcolony growth, revealed that: (i) either reduced cell
   diffusion (which keeps cooperators together) or reduced public good
   diffusion (which keeps the public goods closer to the producer) is not
   only essential but also sufficient for cooperation to be promoted; (ii)
   the sign of selection for or against cooperation can change as a
   function of cell density and in interaction with diffusion parameters;
   and (iii) increased public goods durability has opposing effects on the
   evolution of cooperation depending on the level of cell and public good
   diffusion. Our work highlights that interactions between key parameters
   of public goods cooperation give rise to complex fitness landscapes, a
   finding that calls for multifactorial approaches when studying microbial
   cooperation in natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{The Bohemian Forest harbours one of the largest lynx populations in
   Central Europe, which arose from animals reintroduced in two adjacent
   national parks. Despite an increasing number of population modelling
   approaches, the differences between potential and realised lynx
   distributions urgently need to be explored. We used lynx monitoring data
   from 2005 to 2010 from 530 municipalities in eastern Bavaria and spatial
   estimates of roe deer densities to test the predictions that the
   probability of lynx occurrence (confirmed or unconfirmed) increases with
   (1) decreasing distance to the national park area, (2) increasing forest
   cover, (3) increasing proportion of state-owned forests, (4) increasing
   roe deer density and (5) decreasing human activity. Using a flexible
   additive boosting model, we identified the distance to the national
   parks as the dominant factor, with positive effects on lynx probability
   only up to 70 km from the centre of the two national parks. Moreover,
   forest cover and roe deer density were correlated with increasing lynx
   occurrence. The probability of unconfirmed lynx occurrence increased
   with the proportion of state-owned forest within a municipality. The
   most probable mechanism behind the distance variable is illegal killing
   outside of the national parks. We concluded that despite the small size
   of protected areas in Central Europe, they still provide important
   source areas for this large predator. Moreover, the results supported
   conclusions of previous modelling approaches on the exchange among
   existing sub-populations in Central Europe, and indicated that lynx
   currently might not be able to colonise the next suitable areas. (C)

Abstract = {{Mycorrhizal fungi are crucial for the ecological success of land plants,
   providing their hosts with nutrients in exchange for organic C. However,
   not all plants are mycorrhizal, especially ferns, of which about
   one-third of the species lack this symbiosis. Because the mycorrhizal
   status is evolutionarily ancestral, this lack of mycorrhizae must have
   ecological advantages, but what these advantages are and how they affect
   the competitive ability of non-mycorrhizal plants under natural
   conditions is currently unknown. To address this uncertainty, we studied
   terrestrial fern assemblages and species abundances as well as their
   mycorrhization status, leaf nutrient concentration and relative annual
   growth along an elevational gradient in the Ecuadorian Andes (500-4,000
   m). We surveyed the mycorrhizal status of 375 root samples belonging to
   85 species, and found mycorrhizae in 89 \% of the samples. The degree of
   mycorrhization decreased with elevation but was unrelated to soil
   nutrients. Species with mycorrhizae were significantly more abundant
   than non-mycorrhizal species, but non-mycorrhizal species had
   significantly higher relative growth and concentrations of leaf N, P,
   Mg, and Ca. Our study thus shows that despite lower abundances,
   non-mycorrhizal fern species did not appear to be limited in their
   growth or nutrient supply relative to mycorrhizal ones. As a basis for
   future studies, we hypothesize that non-mycorrhizal fern species may be
   favoured in special microhabitats of the forest understory with high
   soil nutrient or water availability, or that the ecological benefit of
   mycorrhizae is not related to nutrient uptake but rather to, for
   example, pathogen resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Culturally transmitted tool use has important ecological and
   evolutionary consequences and has been proposed as a significant driver
   of human evolution. Such evidence is still scarce in other animals. In
   cetaceans, tool use has been inferred using indirect evidence in one
   population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), where
   particular dolphins ('spongers') use marine sponges during foraging. To
   date, evidence of whether this foraging tactic actually provides access
   to novel food items is lacking. We used fatty acid (FA) signature
   analysis to identify dietary differences between spongers and
   non-spongers, analysing data from 11 spongers and 27 non-spongers from
   two different study sites. Both univariate and multivariate analyses
   revealed significant differences in FA profiles between spongers and
   non-spongers between and within study sites. Moreover, FA profiles
   differed significantly between spongers and non-spongers foraging within
   the same deep channel habitat, whereas the profiles of non-spongers from
   deep channel and shallow habitats at this site could not be
   distinguished. Our results indicate that sponge use by bottlenose
   dolphins is linked to significant differences in diet. It appears that
   cultural transmission of tool use in dolphins, as in humans, allows the
   exploitation of an otherwise unused niche.}},

Title = {{Island biogeography from regional to local scales: evidence for a

   archipelago}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{250-260}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aim The aim of this study was to investigate whether the equilibrium
   theory of island biogeography (ETIB) is equally applicable at regional
   and local spatial scales, and whether the `echo pattern', the
   correlation between regional species pool and local diversity by which
   the diversity of the regional species pool `trickles down' to local
   scales, influences local diversity equally across a range of sampling
   scales.
   Location Twelve mountain regions on islands having different sizes,
   degrees of isolation and environmental conditions in Indonesia and the
   Philippines.
   Methods We sampled ferns in standardized field plots within a fixed
   spatial design at six spatial scales (with the grain size varying from
   plot to island). Using ordinary least squares regression and relative
   variable importance, we tested for the predictive power of area and
   isolation as well as of local and regional environmental factors for
   explaining diversity at the chosen spatial scales.
   Results Consistent with MacArthur and Wilson's ETIB, we found the
   strongest correlations of area and isolation with diversity at regional
   scales. The explanatory power of area increased with increasing spatial
   scale. The strength of the negative relationships among diversity and
   isolation decreased with increasing spatial scale. We found evidence for
   an `echo pattern' at large to intermediate but not at small spatial
   scales.
   Main conclusions Area and isolation are strong predictors of
   biodiversity at regional scales. The size of the species pool has a
   scale-dependent influence on diversity at smaller scales but is
   unimportant at the most local scale, where environmental conditions
   dominate as predictors of diversity. To make predictions about local
   diversity on islands it is therefore important to take the scale
   dependence of the `echo pattern' into account.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{193-199}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The timing of germination is a key life-history trait that may strongly
   influence plant fitness and that sets the stage for selection on traits
   expressed later in the life cycle. In seasonal environments, the period
   favourable for germination and the total length of the growing season
   are limited. The optimal timing of germination may therefore be governed
   by conflicting selection through survival and fecundity. We conducted a
   field experiment to examine the effects of timing of germination on
   survival, fecundity and overall fitness in a natural population of the
   annual herb Arabidopsis thaliana in north-central Sweden. Seedlings were
   transplanted at three different times in late summer and in autumn
   covering the period of seed germination in the study population. Early
   germination was associated with low seedling survival, but also with
   high survival and fecundity among established plants. The advantages of
   germinating early more than balanced the disadvantage and selection
   favoured early germination. The results suggest that low survival among
   early germinating seeds is the main force opposing the evolution of
   earlier germination and that the optimal timing of germination should
   vary in space and time as a function of the direction and strength of
   selection acting during different life-history stages.}},

Title = {{Nitrogen deposition promotes the production of new fungal residues but

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{327-340}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has frequently been observed to
   increase soil carbon (C) storage in forests, but the underlying
   mechanisms still remain unclear. Changes in microbial community
   composition and substrate use are hypothesized to be one of the key
   mechanisms affected by N inputs. Here, we investigated the effects of N
   deposition on amino sugars, which are used as biomarkers for fungal- and
   bacterial-derived microbial residues in soil. We made use of a 4-year
   combined CO2 enrichment and N deposition experiment in model forest
   ecosystems, providing a distinct C-13 signal for new' and old' C in soil
   organic matter and microbial residues measured in density and
   particle-size fractions of soils. Our hypothesis was that N deposition
   decreases the amount of fungal residues in soils, with the new microbial
   residues being more strongly affected than old residues. The soil
   fractionation showed that organic matter and microbial residues are
   mainly stabilized by association with soil minerals in the heavy and
   fine fractions. Moreover, the bacterial residues are relatively enriched
   at mineral surfaces compared to fungal residues. The C-13 tracing
   indicated a greater formation of fungal residues compared to bacterial
   residues after 4years of experiment. In contradiction to our hypotheses,
   N deposition significantly increased the amount of new fungal residues
   in bulk soil and decreased the decomposition of old microbial residues
   associated with soil minerals. The preservation of old microbial
   residues could be due to decreased N limitation of microorganisms and
   therefore a reduced dependence on organic N sources. This mechanism
   might be especially important in fine heavy fractions with low C/N
   ratios, where microbial residues are effectively protected from
   decomposition by association with soil minerals.}},

Abstract = {{Compression fossils from the Silurian and Devonian of southern Britain,
   composed of cuticles and tubes, were described by W. H. Lang as the
   genus Nematothallus and placed, with Prototaxites, in Nematophytales,
   related neither to algae nor tracheophytes. Dispersed cuticles of
   Nematothallus and perforated forms assigned to Cosmochlaina were
   frequently recovered in macerates, their affinities being unresolved.
   New collections from a Lochkovian locality in the Welsh Borderland
   permitted the reconstruction of the stratified thalli of these
   nematophytes; they comprise a superficial cortex (which produced the
   cuticles) overlying a palisade zone composed of septate, parallel tubes,
   presumed to be hyphae, and a basal zone comprising wefts of randomly
   interwoven hyphae. Excellent three dimensional preservation allows the
   erection of a new species of Nematothallus, N.williamii. A similar
   anatomy is seen in a new group of fossils with either circular incisions
   in the cortex or complete separation of thickened cortical cells,
   presumably comprising a developmental sequence. By their stratified
   organization the nematophytes differ from extant and extinct algae and
   bryophytes and the enigmatic Spongiophyton. A complex anatomy and
   septate tubes suggest affinity with lichenized fungi. Limited data
   support a fungal rather than embryophyte chemistry, but a photobiont is
   missing. Nematophytes, globally widespread in cryptogamic covers from
   mid-Ordovician times, added to the biodiversity in early terrestrial
   ecosystems and enhanced chemical weathering.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society

Abstract = {{In the last decade a growing number of efforts have been made to insure
   the weather-related production risks of rural agricultural households in
   the Global South via microinsurance contracts linked to environmental
   indices. Such index insurance products are increasingly championed for
   their ostensible capacity to decrease vulnerability, `crowd in' rural
   credit, and increase productive risk taking. This paper presents an
   empirical and theoretical framework for understanding the explosion of
   these projects, demonstrating that the formation of financial consumer
   subjects who are themselves agricultural producers is an emerging and
   consequential process within the dynamics of (dis)articulation. Rather
   than being hindered by the absence of the real subsumption of land or
   labor to capital, the derivative nature of the index insurance form
   offering only the possibility of remuneration instead of indemnification
   of loss makes it especially well suited to operating in precisely such
   conditions on the edges of (non)market relations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper empirically analyzes the effect of the inclusion of German

   performance. In order to receive robust estimation results, we apply an
   (short-term) event study approach that is based on both a modern asset
   pricing model, namely the three-factor model according to Fama and
   French {[}24], and additionally a t-GARCH(1,1) model. Our empirical
   results suggest that stock markets may penalize the inclusion of a firm
   in sustainability stock indexes. This finding is mainly driven by a
   strongly negative effect of the inclusion in the DJSI World. In
   contrast, we do not find significant average cumulative abnormal returns
   for the inclusion in the DJSI STOXX. This suggests that the inclusion in
   a more visible sustainability stock index may have larger negative
   impacts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although the ultimate causes for variation in contributions to helping
   in cooperative breeders are increasingly well understood, the underlying
   physiological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Recent work has
   suggested that glucocorticoids may play an important role in the
   expression of cooperative behavior. Here, we present the first
   experimental test of the effects of glucocorticoids on helper behavior
   in a cooperative breeder. Glucocorticoid levels of adult female and male
   meerkat, Suricata suricatta, helpers were elevated with an intramuscular
   injection of cortisol (hydrocortisone 21-hemisuccinate sodium salt)
   dissolved in saline, whereas matched controls simultaneously received an
   injection of physiological saline. The treatment successfully elevated
   circulating glucocorticoid levels but did not result in significant
   changes in pup feeding or sentinel behavior. Females, however, spent
   less time foraging when glucocorticoid levels were elevated and appeared
   to spend more time in close proximity to pups. These results provide no
   evidence that glucocorticoids affect cooperative behaviors but suggest
   that there may be an effect on foraging effort and affiliation with
   pups.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change during the Quaternary played an important role in the
   distribution of extant plants. Herein, cone scales of Cedrus (Pinaceae)
   were uncovered from the Upper Pliocene Sanying Formation, Longmen
   Village, Yongping County of Yunnan Province in southwestern China.
   Detailed comparisons show that these fossils all belong to the genus
   Cedrus (Pinaceae), and a new species is proposed, Cedrus angusta sp.
   nov. This find expands the known distribution of Cedrus during the Late
   Pliocene to Yunnan, where the genus no longer exists in natural forests.
   Based on the analysis of reconstructed Neogene climate data, we suggest
   that the intensification of the East Asian winter monsoon during the
   Quaternary may have dramatically increased seasonality and given rise to
   a much drier winter in Yunnan. Combined with information on Cedrus
   fossil records and its seed physiology, we conclude that the
   intensification of a drier climate after the Late Pliocene may have
   prevented the survival of Cedrus seedlings, leading to the eventual
   disappearance of Cedrus in western Yunnan. This study indicates that the
   topography in southwestern China acted as a vital refuge for many plants
   during the Quaternary, but that other species gradually disappeared due
   to the intensification of the monsoonal climate. (C) 2013 University of

Abstract = {{Introduction: Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a chronic disorder
   that often requires long-term treatment. There is a growing interest in
   new substances. In vitro experiments of Bryophyllum pinnatum (BP) on
   porcine bladder muscle have shown a muscle-relaxing effect. In this
   clinical trial we evaluated BP versus placebo regarding efficacy and
   safety.
   Materials and methods: Prospective, double-blind randomized,
   placebo-controlled study with 20 patients (10 BP, 10 placebo);
   medication over 8 weeks; dosage 3 x 2 capsules BP 50\% (350 mg)/day or
   placebo (lactose). Primary aim: reduction of the micturition
   frequency/24 h. Secondary aim: change in quality of life, alterations of
   parameters in the bladder diary and adverse events (AE). Statistical
   analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 20. The groups were
   compared using Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney test; the visits
   using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test.
   Results: Both groups did not differ significantly in demographical data.
   For the primary endpoint, a trend in the reduction of the micturition
   frequency/24 h in the BP group was found: 9.5 +/- 2.2 before and 7.8 +/-
   1.2 after BP versus 9.3 +/- 1.8 before and 9.1 +/- 1.6 after placebo, p
   = 0.064. From visit 2 to visit 4, micturition frequency/24 h improved in
   8/10 patients in the BP group (p = 0.037). In the placebo group,
   micturition frequency/24 h improved in 5/9 patients (p = 0.89).
   Improvement of the QoL did not differ between the two groups. The
   incidence of AE was similar in both groups, no SAE occurred.
   Conclusion: The successful safety outcome and positive trend for
   efficacy permits BP to be further evaluated as a favorable treatment
   option for OAB. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

   a new metagenomic analysis tool called MALT, applied here to search for
   traces of ancient pathogen DNA, we were able to identify Salmonella
   enterica in individuals buried in an early contact era epidemic cemetery
   at Teposcolula-Yucundaa, Oaxaca in southern Mexico. This cemetery is
   linked, based on historical and archaeological evidence, to the
   1545-1550 ce epidemic that affected large parts of Mexico. Locally, this
   epidemic was known as `cocoliztli', the pathogenic cause of which has
   been debated for more than a century. Here, we present genome-wide data
   from ten individuals for Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar
   Paratyphi C, a bacterial cause of enteric fever. We propose that S.
   Paratyphi C be considered a strong candidate for the epidemic population
   decline during the 1545 cocoliztli outbreak at Teposcolula-Yucundaa.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of biodiversity in supporting ecosystem functioning is
   generally well accepted. However, most evidence comes from small-scale
   studies, and scaling-up patterns of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning
   (B-EF) remains challenging, in part because the importance of
   environmental factors in shaping B-EF relations is poorly understood.
   Using a forest research platform in which 26 ecosystem functions were
   measured along gradients of tree species richness in six regions across
   Europe, we investigated the extent and the potential drivers of context
   dependency of B-EF relations. Despite considerable variation in species
   richness effects across the continent, we found a tendency for stronger
   B-EF relations in drier climates as well as in areas with longer growing
   seasons and more functionally diverse tree species. The importance of
   water availability in driving context dependency suggests that as water
   limitation increases under climate change, biodiversity may become even
   more important to support high levels of functioning in European
   forests.}},

Title = {{Biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning in a 15-year grassland
   experiment: Patterns, mechanisms, and open questions}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{1-73}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the past two decades, a large number of studies have investigated the
   relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, most of
   which focussed on a limited set of ecosystem variables. The Jena
   Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant
   diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a
   multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of
   research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of
   manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With
   more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena
   Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for
   functional biodiversity research.
   First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness
   is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an
   ecosystem. About 45\% of different types of ecosystem processes measured
   in the `main experiment', where plant species richness ranged from 1 to
   60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness,
   providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant
   driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at
   the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of
   species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength
   of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that
   many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years
   to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that
   biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends
   from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena
   Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for
   example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly
   some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when plant communities
   experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This
   highlights the need to revisit diversity-stability theory.
   Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant
   functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for
   ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong
   effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass
   production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not
   instead of, effects of plant species richness.
   Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on
   multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded
   positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was
   stronger for above-than for belowground organisms, and stronger for
   herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets
   diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger
   than the effect on species abundances.
   Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on
   N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating
   between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element
   stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less
   affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover
   and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g.
   carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species
   richness. Variables of the N cycle responded less strongly to plant
   species richness than variables of the C cycle.
   Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the
   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment,
   most investigated plant traits, both above-and belowground, were plastic
   and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way,
   suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits
   to particular functions.
   Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused
   by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena
   Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex
   interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. soil carbon storage and
   greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and
   activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation
   experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground
   invertebrates, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments,
   supported the important role of the biotic component for element and
   water fluxes.
   Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context
   of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of
   increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass
   was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive
   grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency.
   Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to
   that of conventionally used energy crops. These results suggest that
   diverse `High Nature Value Grasslands' are multifunctional and can
   deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related
   services.
   A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in
   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding
   of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the
   effort ( in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to
   plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of
   ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect monoculture
   performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of
   biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments.
   To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive
   analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main
   challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our
   mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects
   differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no
   simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested
   to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some
   have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical
   root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in
   targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena
   Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect
   results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse
   communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant
   growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait
   differences leading to complementarity in resource uptake.
   Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of
   competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that
   predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible.

   Kratzsch, Steffen Eismann, Heike Scheffler, Katja Kunze, Silke
   Hengelhaupt, Sylvia Junghans, Ulrike Wehmeier, and Ute Kober. Further
   technical help was provided by Uta Gerighausen and Steffen Ferber. All
   student helpers and various ecological volunteers also contributed
   greatly to this experiment. Enrica Luca contributed plant cover data to
   illustrate the long-term changes in the plant community. Norma Nitschke
   summarized data on voles and Manfred Turke kindly illustrated the
   mechanisms underlying the positive biodiversity effect on plant biomass
   (Fig. 23). The first author, who was the `speaker' of the Jena
   Experiment from 2002-2015, would particularly like to thank all people
   involved in the experiment for their contribution to the joint work.
   Scientists come in different shapes and sizes and agreeing on something
   is not always easy. It is a particular feature of the Jena Experiment
   that the group was, mostly, in high spirit so that cooperation was good
   and fruitful. The many joint publications are testimony to the team
   spirit. We also thank Klaus Hoevemeyer for carefully editing the paper.
   A final thank you goes to Jan Leps and two anonymous reviewers who took
   up the challenge to critically read previous versions of this

Abstract = {{Despite calls for improved responses to emerging infectious diseases in
   wildlife, management is seldom considered until a disease has been
   detected in affected populations. Reactive approaches may limit the
   potential for control and increase total response costs. An alternative,
   proactive management framework can identify immediate actions that
   reduce future impacts even before a disease is detected, and plan
   subsequent actions that are conditional on disease emergence. We
   identify four main obstacles to developing proactive management
   strategies for the newly discovered salamander pathogen Batrachochytrium
   salamandrivorans (Bsal). Given that uncertainty is a hallmark of
   wildlife disease management and that associated decisions are often
   complicated by multiple competing objectives, we advocate using decision
   analysis to create and evaluate trade-offs between proactive
   (pre-emergence) and reactive (post-emergence) management options. Policy
   makers and natural resource agency personnel can apply principles from
   decision analysis to improve strategies for countering emerging
   infectious diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Explosive diversification is widespread in eukaryotes, making it
   difficult to resolve phylogenetic relationships. Eudicots contain c.
   75\% of extant flowering plants, are important for human livelihood and
   terrestrial ecosystems, and have probably experienced explosive
   diversifications. The eudicot phylogenetic relationships, especially
   among those of the Pentapetalae, remain unresolved.
   Here, we present a highly supported eudicot phylogeny and
   diversification rate shifts using 31 newly generated transcriptomes and
   88 other datasets covering 70\% of eudicot orders.
   A highly supported eudicot phylogeny divided Pentapetalae into two
   groups: one with rosids, Saxifragales, Vitales and Santalales; the other
   containing asterids, Caryophyllales and Dilleniaceae, with uncertainty
   for Berberidopsidales. Molecular clock analysis estimated that crown
   eudicots originated c. 146 Ma, considerably earlier than earliest
   tricolpate pollen fossils and most other molecular clock estimates, and
   Pentapetalae sequentially diverged into eight major lineages within c.
   15 Myr. Two identified increases of diversification rate are located in
   the stems leading to Pentapetalae and asterids, and lagged behind the
   gamma hexaploidization.
   The nuclear genes from newly generated transcriptomes revealed a
   well-resolved eudicot phylogeny, sequential separation of major core
   eudicot lineages and temporal mode of diversifications, providing new
   insights into the evolutionary trend of morphologies and contributions
   to the diversification of eudicots.}},

Title = {{Tree diversity increases levels of herbivore damage in a subtropical
   forest canopy: evidence for dietary mixing by arthropods?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Aims Plant diversity has been linked to both increasing and decreasing
   levels of arthropod herbivore damage in different plant communities. So
   far, these links have mainly been studied in grasslands or in artificial
   tree plantations with low species richness. Furthermore, most studies
   provide results from newly established experimental plant communities
   where trophic links are not fully established or from stands of tree
   saplings that have not yet developed a canopy. Here, we test how tree
   diversity in a species-rich subtropical forest in China with fully
   developed tree canopy affects levels of herbivore damage caused by
   different arthropod feeding guilds.
   Methods We established 27 plots of 30 x 30 m area. The plots were
   selected randomly but with the constraint that they had to span a large
   range of tree diversity as required for comparative studies in contrast
   to sample surveys. We recorded herbivore damage caused by arthropod
   feeding guilds (leaf chewers, leaf skeletonizers and sap feeders) on
   canopy leaves of all major tree species.
   Important Findings Levels of herbivore damage increased with tree
   species richness and tree phylogenetic diversity. These effects were
   most pronounced for damage caused by leaf chewers. Although the two
   diversity measures were highly correlated, we additionally found a
   significant interaction between them, whereby species richness increased
   herbivory mostly at low levels of phylogenetic diversity. Tree species
   with the lowest proportion of canopy leaf biomass in a plot tended to
   suffer the highest levels of herbivore damage, which is in contrast to
   expectations based on the resource concentration hypothesis. Our results
   are in agreement with expectations of the dietary mixing hypothesis
   where generalist herbivores with a broad spectrum of food plants benefit
   from increased resource diversity in tree species-rich forest patches.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria of the genus Burkholderia establish an obligate symbiosis with
   plant species of the Rubiaceae and Primulaceae families. The bacteria,
   housed within the leaves, are transmitted hereditarily and have not yet
   been cultured. We have sequenced and compared the genomes of eight
   bacterial leaf nodule symbionts of the Rubiaceae plant family. All of
   the genomes exhibit features consistent with genome erosion. Genes
   potentially involved in the biosynthesis of kirkamide, an insecticidal
   C7N aminocyclitol, are conserved in most Rubiaceae symbionts. However,
   some have partially lost the kirkamide pathway due to genome erosion and
   are unable to synthesize the compound. Kirkamide synthesis is therefore
   not responsible for the obligate nature of the symbiosis. More
   importantly, we find evidence of intra-clade horizontal gene transfer
   (HGT) events affecting genes of the secondary metabolism. This indicates
   that substantial gene flow can occur at the early stages following host
   restriction in leaf nodule symbioses. We propose that host-switching
   events and plasmid conjugative transfers could have promoted these HGTs.
   This genomic analysis of leaf nodule symbionts gives, for the first
   time, new insights in the genome evolution of obligate symbionts in
   their early stages of the association with plants.}},

Abstract = {{Cattle treated with the veterinary parasiticide ivermectin fecally
   excrete residues. The authors report the exposition and dissipation
   characteristics of these residues in dung of ivermectin-treated cattle
   and in soil beneath this dung on pastures in Canada, France,
   Switzerland, and The Netherlands. Residues were quantified for dung
   collected from cattle after 3d, 7d, 14d, and 28d posttreatment and
   subsequently exposed in the field for up to 13mo. The authors optimized
   a high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection method
   to detect ivermectin residues in dung and soil matrices. They showed
   that a solid phase extraction and purification step generally can be
   eliminated to reduce the time and cost of these analyses. They also
   found that the addition of water to relatively dry samples improves the
   extraction efficiency of residues. They then analyzed the field samples
   to document differences in ivermectin dissipation in cattle dung among
   sites, with 50\% dissipation times of up to 32d and 90\% dissipation
   times >396d. They further showed that the dissipation characteristics of
   residues are comparable between dung of ivermectin-treated cattle and
   dung to which ivermectin has been added directly. Lastly, they report
   the first use of a desorption electrospray
   ionization-high-resolution-mass spectrometric method to detect residues
   of metabolites in a dung matrix. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;35:1924-1933.

Abstract = {{The Early Pleistocene sites of Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva-3
   (Guadix-Baza Basin, SE Spain) have yielded thousands of Mode 1 or
   Oldowan lithic artifacts (both sites) and one tooth (in layer D,
   formerly 5 of Barranco Leon), today considered to be some of the
   earliest evidence of humans in western Europe at ca. 1.2-1.5 Ma.
   Previous quantitative paleoclimatic reconstructions based on herpetile
   assemblages indicated that, during the formation of these two sites, the
   mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation were higher than
   they are now in the southeastern Iberian Peninsula, with lower
   continentality. Here, we propose new climatic reconstructions where the
   mean monthly temperature and precipitation and the difference between
   the four driest months and the four rainiest months are estimated.
   Climatograms are built in order to specify the distribution and
   variation of temperature and precipitation during the year, and the
   Aridity Indices of Gaussen, Lautensach-Mayer, Dantin-Revenga and De
   Martonne are used to characterize ombroclimatic differences. According
   to these new climatic parameters, rainfall distribution through the year
   shows considerably higher precipitation in every season except summer
   and early autumn, which remain drier and thus consistent with a
   Mediterranean climate pattern. No change is observed in the duration of
   the aridity period, which remains four months long. However, the value
   of the Aridity Index of De Martonne is higher than 20 (subhumid climate)
   in Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva-3, whereas today it is lower than 20
   (semi-arid climate), suggesting major changes in the ombroclimatic type.
   These results yield a more precise scenario for the paleoclimatic
   conditions that prevailed during the late Early Pleistocene in the
   Guadix-Baza Basin and permit us to contrast the ages obtained from
   numerical dating and biochronology. The very warm and humid climate
   reconstructed for both Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva-3 suggests that,
   in accordance with the numerical dating, these two sites are
   contemporaneous with the particularly warm interglacial peaks of Marine
   Isotope Stages 43-49 (i.e. between 1.35 and 1.47 Ma). The similarity
   between reconstructed climates, the high overlap between their estimated
   precipitation and between the difference of the driest from the rainiest
   season suggest that these sites may correspond to the same part of a
   climatic glacial/interglacial cycle, but because the evolutionary degree
   of the rodent Mimomys savini shows a slightly more derived state for
   Fuente Nueva-3 than for Barranco Leon (i.e a short chronological
   difference between the two sites), they may correspond to two
   consecutive warm interglacial peaks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning can potentially
   interact with global climate by altering fluxes of the radiatively
   active trace gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). We studied the
   effects of grassland species richness (1-16) in combination with
   application of fertilizer (nitrogen:phosphorus:potassium = 100:43.6:83
   kg ha(-1) a(-1)) on N2O and CH4 fluxes in a long-term field experiment.
   Soil N2O emissions, measured over 2 years using static chambers,
   decreased with species richness unless fertilizer was added. N2O
   emissions increased with fertilization and the fraction of legumes in
   plant communities. Soil CH4 uptake, a process driven by methanotrophic
   bacteria, decreased with plant species numbers, irrespective of
   fertilization. Using structural equation models, we related trace gas
   fluxes to soil moisture, soil inorganic N concentrations, nitrifying and
   denitrifying enzyme activity, and the abundance of ammonia oxidizers,
   nitrite oxidizers, and denitrifiers (quantified by real-time PCR of gene
   fragments amplified from microbial DNA in soil). These analyses
   indicated that plant species richness increased soil moisture, which in
   turn increased N cycling-related activities. Enhanced N cycling
   increased N2O emission and soil CH4 uptake, with the latter possibly
   caused by removal of inhibitory ammonium by nitrification. The
   moisture-related indirect effects were surpassed by direct,
   moisture-independent effects opposite in direction. Microbial gene
   abundances responded positively to fertilizer but not to plant species
   richness. The response patterns we found were statistically robust and
   highlight the potential of plant biodiversity to interact with climatic
   change through mechanisms unrelated to carbon storage and associated
   carbon dioxide removal.}},

Abstract = {{New and emerging environmental pathogens pose some of the greatest
   threats to modern aquaculture, a critical source of food protein
   globally. As with other intensive farming practices, increasing our
   understanding of the biology of infections is important to improve
   animal welfare and husbandry. The gill infection epitheliocystis is
   increasingly problematic in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), a major
   Mediterranean aquaculture species. Epitheliocystis is generally
   associated with chlamydial bacteria, yet we were not able to localise
   chlamydial targets within the major gilthead seabream lesions. Two
   previously unidentified species within a novel beta-proteobacterial
   genus were instead identified. These co-infecting intracellular bacteria
   have been characterised using highresolution imaging and genomics,
   presenting the most comprehensive study on epitheliocystis agents to
   date. Draft genomes of the two uncultured species, Ca. Ichthyocystis
   hellenicum and Ca. Ichthyocystis sparus, have been de novo sequenced and
   annotated from preserved material. Analysis of the genomes shows a
   compact core indicating a metabolic dependency on the host, and an
   accessory genome with an unprecedented number of tandemly arrayed gene
   families. This study represents a critical insight into novel, emerging
   fish pathogens and will be used to underpin future investigations into
   the bacterial origins, and to develop diagnostic and treatment
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The Qesem Cave Middle Pleistocene hominin site has yielded a well
   preserved lower second deciduous molar (dm(2)-QC2), among several other
   human dental remains. It has been previously described by Hershkovitz et
   al. using traditional methods. In this study, we used multiple
   approaches in order to characterize the outer and inner morphology of
   dm2-QC2, namely a descriptive investigation of the inner morphology,
   analysis of the dental tissues, and comparative 3D geometric
   morphometric investigation of various aspects of the dental crown based
   on data gathered from mu CT images. Dm(2)-QC2 was compared to a sample
   of 44 specimens, including recent and fossil modern humans,
   Neanderthals, and Homo erectus.
   Our comprehensive quantitative investigation agrees with Hershkovitz et
   al. with regard to the mixed morphology of this specimen. Dm(2)-QC2
   allies morphologically with Neanderthals and Skhul X for its squared
   cervical outline, but is intermediate between modern humans and
   Neanderthals for its mildly distally expanded crown outline. Dm(2)-QC2
   falls within Neanderthal variability in having relatively high dentine
   horns with inwardly bent tips. It is peculiar for its mesio-distal
   elongation of the occlusal marginal ridge at the enamel-dentine
   junction. The relative enamel thickness delivers different results if
   measured at the mesial section (intermediate but closer to modern
   humans) or at the entire crown (close to the Neanderthal distribution).
   In terms of size, dm(2)-QC2 and Qafzeh 15 are among the largest
   specimens in our sample.
   Dm(2)-QC2 shows a mosaic of features, with a prevalence of those typical
   or at least frequent in Neanderthals. Among the latter, the mid-trigonid
   crest and taurodontism are only slightly expressed. On the basis of this
   isolated dental evidence, and considering the paucity of information
   available on human evolution in the Levantine Middle Pleistocene, we do
   not attempt a taxonomic classification of this single tooth. However,
   dm(2)-QC2 indicates that Neanderthal features were already present in
   the Middle Pleistocene Levant. We cannot rule out the possibility that
   the dm(2)-QC2 population contributed to later Levantine or other
   Eurasian populations, but this is too speculative given the information
   currently available. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

Abstract = {{Successful double fertilization and subsequent seed development in
   flowering plants requires the delivery of two sperm cells, transported
   by a pollen tube, into the embryo sac of an ovule. The embryo sac cells
   tightly control synergid cell death, and as a result the polyspermy
   block. Arabinogalactan proteins are highly glycosylated proteins thought
   to be involved in several steps of the reproductive process. We show
   that JAGGER, Arabinogalactan Protein 4, is an important molecule
   necessary to prevent the growth of multiple pollen tubes into one embryo
   sac in Arabidopsis thaliana. In jagger, an AGP4 knockout mutant, the
   pistils show impaired pollen tube blockage as a consequence of the
   survival of the persistent synergid. JAGGER seems to be involved in the
   signaling pathway that leads to a blockage of pollen tube attraction.
   Our results shed light on the mechanism responsible for preventing
   polyspermy in Arabidopsis and for safeguarding successful fertilization
   of all ovules in one pistil, ensuring seed set and the next generation.}},

Title = {{Reduced flight-to-light behaviour of moth populations exposed to
   long-term urban light pollution}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The globally increasing light pollution is a well-recognized threat to
   ecosystems, with negative effects on human, animal and plant wellbeing.
   The most well-known and widely documented consequence of light pollution
   is the generally fatal attraction of nocturnal insects to artificial
   light sources. However, the evolutionary consequences are unknown. Here
   we report that moth populations from urban areas with high, globally
   relevant levels of light pollution over several decades show a
   significantly reduced flight-to-light behaviour compared with
   populations of the same species from pristine dark-sky habitats. Using a
   common garden setting, we reared moths from 10 different populations
   from early-instar larvae and experimentally compared their
   flight-to-light behaviour under standardized conditions. Moths from
   urban populations had a significant reduction in the flight-to-light
   behaviour compared with pristine populations. The reduced attraction to
   light sources of `city moths' may directly increase these individuals'
   survival and reproduction. We anticipate that it comes with a reduced
   mobility, which negatively affects foraging as well as colonization
   ability. As nocturnal insects are of eminent significance as pollinators
   and the primary food source of many vertebrates, an evolutionary change
   of the flight-to-light behaviour thereby potentially cascades across
   species interaction networks.}},

Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Urban growth is a major factor of global environmental change and has
   important impacts on biodiversity, such as changes in species
   composition and biotic homogenization. Most previous studies have
   focused on effects of urban area as a general measure of urbanization,
   and on few or single taxa. Here, we analyzed the impacts of the
   different components of urban sprawl (i.e., scattered and widespread
   urban growth) on species richness of a variety of taxonomic groups
   covering mosses, vascular plants, gastropods, butterflies, and birds at
   the habitat and landscape scales. Besides urban area, we considered the
   average age, imperviousness, and dispersion degree of urban area, along
   with human population density, to disentangle the effects of the
   different components of urban sprawl on biodiversity. The study was
   carried out in the Swiss Plateau that has undergone substantial urban
   sprawl in recent decades.
   Vascular plants and birds showed the strongest responses to urban
   sprawl, especially at the landscape scale, with non-native and ruderal
   plants proliferating and common generalist birds increasing at the
   expense of specialist birds as urban sprawl grew. Overall, urban area
   had the greatest contribution on such impacts, but additional effects of
   urban dispersion (i.e., increase of non-native plants) and human
   population density (i.e., increases of ruderal plants and common
   generalist birds) were found. Our findings support the hypothesis that
   negative impacts of urban sprawl on biodiversity can be reduced by
   compacting urban growth while still avoiding the formation of very
   densely populated areas.}},

Abstract = {{In eukaryotic cells, histones are subject to a large number of
   posttranslational modifications whose sequential or combinatorial action
   affects chromatin structure and genome function. We identified
   acetylation at Lys-36 in histone H3 (H3K36ac) as a new chromatin
   modification in plants. The H3K36ac modification is evolutionary
   conserved in seed plants, including the gymnosperm Norway spruce (Picea
   abies) and the angiosperms rice (Oryza sativa), tobacco (Nicotiana
   tabacum), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In Arabidopsis,
   H3K36ac is highly enriched in euchromatin but not in heterochromatin.
   Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments
   revealed that H3K36ac peaks at the 59 end of genes, mainly on the two
   nucleosomes immediately distal to the transcription start site,
   independently of gene length. H3K36ac overlaps with H3K4me3 and the H2A.
   Z histone variant. The histone acetyl transferase GCN5 and the histone
   deacetylase HDA19 are required for H3K36ac homeostasis. H3K36ac and
   H3K36me3 show negative crosstalk, which is mediated by GCN5 and the
   histone methyl transferase SDG8. Although H3K36ac is associated with
   gene activity, we did not find a linear relationship between H3K36ac and
   transcript levels, suggesting that H3K36ac is a binary indicator of
   transcription.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of the vast diversity of floral volatiles is little
   understood, although they serve fundamental functions, such as
   pollinator attraction and herbivore deterrence. Floral volatiles are
   often species specific, yet highly variable and sensitive to
   environmental factors. To date, nothing is known about the heritability
   of floral volatiles, and whether individual compounds can evolve
   independently or solely in concert with the whole volatile bouquet.
   We conducted bi-directional artificial selection on four target floral
   volatiles to estimate heritability and correlated pleiotropic responses
   in the wild turnip (Brassica rapa).
   The realized heritability of the four target volatiles ranged from 20\%
   to 45\%. The average narrow-sense heritability of all 13 analyzed floral
   volatiles was 18\% based on parent-offspring regressions. There were
   pleiotropic effects of the selected floral volatile compounds on other
   constituents of the floral scent bouquet, on flowering time and on some
   morphological traits. We found that the whole floral scent bouquet
   changed, even when there was selection only on single compounds, with
   the overall phenotypic covariance being unaffected.
   Our study demonstrates that floral scent can evolve rapidly under
   phenotypic selection, but with additional correlated responses in traits
   that are not direct targets of selection.}},

Abstract = {{Similarity among species in traits related to ecological interactions is
   frequently associated with common ancestry. Thus, closely related
   species usually interact with ecologically similar partners, which can
   be reinforced by diverse co-evolutionary processes. The effect of
   habitat fragmentation on the phylogenetic signal in interspecific
   interactions and correspondence between plant and animal phylogenies is,
   however, unknown. Here, we address to what extent phylogenetic signal
   and co-phylogenetic congruence of plant-animal interactions depend on
   habitat size and isolation by analysing the phylogenetic structure of 12
   pollination webs from isolated Pampean hills. Phylogenetic signal in
   interspecific interactions differed among webs, being stronger for
   flower-visiting insects than plants. Phylogenetic signal and overall
   co-phylogenetic congruence increased independently with hill size and
   isolation. We propose that habitat fragmentation would erode the
   phylogenetic structure of interaction webs. A decrease in phylogenetic
   signal and co-phylogenetic correspondence in plant-pollinator
   interactions could be associated with less reliable mutualism and
   erratic co-evolutionary change.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Thinning rates for the debris-covered Gangotri Glacier and its tributary
   glaciers during the period 1968-2014, length variation and area vacated
   at the snout from 1965 to 2015, and seasonal variation of ice-surface
   velocity for the last two decades have been investigated in this study.
   It was found that the mass loss of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers
   was slightly less than those reported for other debris-covered glaciers
   in the Himalayan regions. The average velocity during 2006-14 decreased
   by similar to 6.7\% as compared with that during 1993-2006. The
   debris-covered area of the main trunk of Gangotri Glacier increased
   significantly from 1965 until 2015 with the maximum rate of increase
   (0.8 +/- 0.2 km(2) a(-1)) during 2006-15. The retreat (similar to 9.0
   +/- 3.5 m a(-1)) was less in recent years (2006-2015) but the
   down-wasting (0.34 +/- 0.2 m a(-1)) in the same period (2006-2014) was
   higher than that (0.20 +/- 0.1 m a(-1)) during 1968-2006. The study
   reinforced the established fact that the glacier length change is a
   delayed response to climate change and, in addition, is affected by
   debris cover, whereas glacier mass balance is a more direct and
   immediate response. Therefore, it is recommended to study the glacier
   mass balance and not only the glacier extent, to conclude about a
   glacier's response to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are promoted as biofertilizers for
   sustainable agriculture. So far, most researchers have investigated the
   effects of AMF on plant growth under highly controlled conditions with
   sterilized soil, soil substrates or soils with low available P or low
   inoculum potential. However, it is still poorly documented whether
   inoculated AMF can successfully establish in field soils with native AMF
   communities and enhance plant growth. We inoculated grassland microcosms
   planted with a grass clover mixture (Lolium multiflorum and Trifolium
   pratense) with the arbuscidar mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare.
   The microcosms were filed with eight different unsterilized field soils
   that varied greatly in soil type and chemical characteristio and
   indigenous AMF communities. We tested whether inoculation with AMF
   enhanced plant biomass and R. irregulare abundance using a species
   specific VCR. Inoculation increased the abundance of R. irregulare in
   all soils, irrespective of soil P availability, the initial abundance of
   R. irregulare or the abundance of native AM fungal communities. AMF
   inoculation had no effect on the grass but significantly enhanced clover
   yield in five out of eight field soils. The results demonstrate that AMF
   inoculation can be successful, even when soil P availability is high and
   native AMF communities are abundant.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{1537-1552}},
Abstract = {{Due to the large size (e. g. sections of tree trunks) and highly
   heterogeneous spatial distribution of deadwood, the timescales involved
   in the coarse woody debris (CWD) decay of Picea abies (L.) Karst. and
   Larix decidua Mill. in Alpine forests are largely unknown. We
   investigated the CWD decay dynamics in an Alpine valley in Italy using
   the chronosequence approach and the five-decay class system that is
   based on a macromorphological assessment. For the decay classes 1-3,
   most of the dendrochronological samples were cross-dated to assess the
   time that had elapsed since tree death, but for decay classes 4 and 5
   (poorly preserved tree rings) radiocarbon dating was used. In addition,
   density, cellulose, and lignin data were measured for the dated CWD. The
   decay rate constants for spruce and larch were estimated on the basis of
   the density loss using a single negative exponential model, a regression
   approach, and the stage-based matrix model. In the decay classes 1-3,
   the ages of the CWD were similar and varied between 1 and 54 years for
   spruce and 3 and 40 years for larch, with no significant differences
   between the classes; classes 1-3 are therefore not indicative of
   deadwood age. This seems to be due to a time lag between the death of a
   standing tree and its contact with the soil. We found distinct
   tree-species-specific differences in decay classes 4 and 5, with larch
   CWD reaching an aver-age age of 210 years in class 5 and spruce only 77
   years. The mean CWD rate constants were estimated to be in the range
   0.018 to 0.022 y(-1) for spruce and to about 0.012 y(-1) for larch.
   Snapshot sampling (chronosequences) may overestimate the age and mean
   residence time of CWD. No sampling bias was, however, detectable using
   the stage-based matrix model. Cellulose and lignin time trends could be
   derived on the basis of the ages of the CWD. The half-lives for
   cellulose were 21 years for spruce and 50 years for larch. The half-life
   of lignin is considerably higher and may be more than 100 years in larch
   CWD. Consequently, the decay of Picea abies and Larix decidua is very
   low. Several uncertainties, however, remain: C-14 dating of CWD from
   decay classes 4 and 5 and having a pre-bomb age is often difficult
   (large age range due to methodological constraints) and fall rates of
   both European larch and Norway spruce are missing.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in land use are among the forces shaping Earth's surface. In
   many industrialized areas, the loss of a traditional state of dynamic
   equilibrium between traditional management and natural dynamics is
   followed by abandonment to regeneration processes. This can reduce
   ecological complexity at the landscape scale and negatively affect
   biodiversity patterns. In this study, we investigate the relation
   between land use change and plant species diversity in the network of
   protected areas (PAs) of the province of Siena (Tuscany, Central Italy).
   This is an area characterized by long-lasting human activities and
   highly renowned cultural landscapes. We used remotely sensed, mapping
   and ground based plant compositional data, to investigate the present
   pattern of plant species diversity, the changes of landscape structure
   and changes in forest habitats. Most of the plant diversity present in
   this network of PAs is due to broad scale gradients due to ecological
   diversity but also to human management. Most of the area is currently
   covered by forests and analysis of a historical sequence of spatial data
   reveals that this is largely a consequence of the abandonment of
   traditional management during the last decades. Finally, focusing on
   forest succession as a consequence of land use change, we demonstrate
   that species richness significantly declines with increasing age of
   forest stands. Taken together, our results confirm that the recent
   trends of rural abandonment are leading to homogenization and
   biodiversity loss in traditional landscapes of Mediterranean Europe. We
   discuss implications for policy, and suggest that PA management in
   cultural and historical landscapes should pay increasing attention
   traditional anthropic practices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the scales and temporalities through which
   climate change impacts may be rendered into socio-ecological fixes for
   crises of overaccumulation within the (re)insurance industry. The
   property insurance and catastrophe reinsurance sectors are notorious for
   their cyclicity, with prices and returns oscillating dramatically
   between soft and hard markets. The problem of overaccummulation in soft
   market periods is often resolved by the destruction of reinsurers'
   capital reserves through huge catastrophic losses. This is typically
   followed by the revision of catastrophe models and reestimation of
   exposed values, processes which absorb additional (re)insurance capital
   and provide technoscientific legitimacy for raising rates. Reframing
   climate change risk in terms of ecologically-sourced devaluation
   suggests that, rather than posing an immediate existential threat, in
   the short to medium term the uncertain impacts of global climate change
   might constitute a recurrent catastrophic fix for particular segments of
   financial capital. This highlights both the productivity of uncertainty
   about climate change impacts and the limits of presuming that the
   operations of the private insurance market can produce a built
   environment more adapted to climate change. Rather, the more likely
   outcome is splintering protectionism: a patchwork of high risk, high
   reward areas where insurance is available only to those with the ability
   to pay rising premiums, leaving the state to manage the retreat and
   relocation of less remunerative properties and populations.}},

Abstract = {{The production of beneficial public goods is common in the microbial
   world, and so is cheating - the exploitation of public goods by
   nonproducing mutants. Here, we examine co-evolutionary dynamics between
   cooperators and cheats and ask whether cooperators can evolve strategies
   to reduce the burden of exploitation, and whether cheats in turn can
   improve their exploitation abilities. We evolved cooperators of the
   bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, producing the shareable
   iron-scavenging siderophore pyoverdine, together with cheats, defective
   in pyoverdine production but proficient in uptake. We found that
   cooperators managed to co-exist with cheats in 56\% of all replicates
   over approximately 150 generations of experimental evolution. Growth and
   competition assays revealed that co-existence was fostered by a
   combination of general adaptions to the media and specific adaptions to
   the co-evolving opponent. Phenotypic screening and whole-genome
   resequencing of evolved clones confirmed this pattern, and suggest that
   cooperators became less exploitable by cheats because they significantly
   reduced their pyoverdine investment. Cheats, meanwhile, improved
   exploitation efficiency through mutations blocking the costly
   pyoverdine-signalling pathway. Moreover, cooperators and cheats evolved
   reduced motility, a pattern that likely represents adaptation to
   laboratory conditions, but at the same time also affects social
   interactions by reducing strain mixing and pyoverdine sharing. Overall,
   we observed parallel evolution, where co-existence of cooperators and
   cheats was enabled by a combination of adaptations to the abiotic and
   social environment and their interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Although linkage maps are important tools in evolutionary biology, their
   availability for wild populations is limited. The population of song
   sparrows (Melospiza melodia) on Mandarte Island, Canada, is among the
   more intensively studied wild animal populations. Its long-term pedigree
   data, together with extensive genetic sampling, have allowed the study
   of a range of questions in evolutionary biology and ecology. However,
   the availability of genetic markers has been limited. We here describe
   191 new microsatellite loci, including 160 high-quality polymorphic
   autosomal, 7 Z-linked and 1W-linked markers. We used these markers to
   construct a linkage map for song sparrows with a total sex-averaged map
   length of 1731 cM and covering 35 linkage groups, and hence, these
   markers cover most of the 38-40 chromosomes. Female and male map lengths
   did not differ significantly. We then bioinformatically mapped these
   loci to the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genome and found that
   linkage groups were conserved between song sparrows and zebra finches.
   Compared to the zebra finch, marker order within small linkage groups
   was well conserved, whereas the larger linkage groups showed some
   intrachromosomal rearrangements. Finally, we show that as expected,
   recombination frequency between linked loci explained the majority of
   variation in gametic phase disequilibrium. Yet, there was substantial
   overlap in gametic phase disequilibrium between pairs of linked and
   unlinked loci. Given that the microsatellites described here lie on 35
   of the 38-40 chromosomes, these markers will be useful for studies in
   this species, as well as for comparative genomics studies with other
   species.}},

Abstract = {{2-Subtituted benzothiazoles are widely used industrial chemicals whose
   occurrence in environmental samples has been shown to be ubiquitous.
   However, knowledge about human exposure to these compounds and their
   excretion route is still scarce. Here, we demonstrate for the first time
   the detection of benzothiazole derivatives in exhaled breath. Real-time
   analysis of breath was carried out by means of secondary electrospray
   ionization coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. This coupling
   allowed not only the detection of these compounds in breath with a
   sensitivity in the pptv range but also their robust identification by
   comparing tandem high-resolution mass spectra from breath and standards.
   For further confirmation, benzothiazoles were also determined in exhaled
   breath condensate samples by means of ultra high-performance liquid
   chromatography. This approach strengthened the identification as a
   result of excellent matches in retention times and also allowed
   quantification. An estimated total daily exhalation of ca. 20 mu g
   day(-1) was calculated for the six benzothiazole derivatives found in
   breath.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative-genetic models of differentiation under migration-selection
   balance often rely on the assumption of normally distributed genotypic
   and phenotypic values. When a population is subdivided into demes with
   selection toward different local optima, migration between demes may
   result in asymmetric, or skewed, local distributions. Using a simplified
   two-habitat model, we derive formulas without a priori assuming a
   Gaussian distribution of genotypic values, and we find expressions that
   naturally incorporate higher moments, such as skew. These formulas yield
   predictions of the expected divergence under migration-selection balance
   that are more accurate than models assuming Gaussian distributions,
   which illustrates the importance of incorporating these higher moments
   to assess the response to selection in heterogeneous environments. We
   further show with simulations that traits with loci of large effect
   display the largest skew in their distribution at migration-selection

Abstract = {{Sexual reproduction in flowering plants offers a number of remarkable
   aspects to developmental biologists. First, the spore mother cells -
   precursors of the plant reproductive lineage - are specified late in
   development, as opposed to precocious germline isolation during
   embryogenesis in most animals. Second, unlike in most animals where
   meiosis directly produces gametes, plant meiosis entails the
   differentiation of a multicellular, haploid gametophyte, within which
   gametic as well as non-gametic accessory cells are formed. These
   observations raise the question of the factors inducing and modus
   operandi of cell fate transitions that originate in floral tissues and
   gametophytes, respectively. Cell fate transitions in the reproductive
   lineage imply cellular reprogramming operating at the physiological,
   cytological and transcriptome level, but also at the chromatin level. A
   number of observations point to large-scale chromatin reorganization
   events associated with cellular differentiation of the female spore
   mother cells and of the female gametes. These include a reorganization
   of the heterochromatin compartment, the genome-wide alteration of the
   histone modification landscape, and the remodeling of nucleosome
   composition. The dynamic expression of DNA methyltransferases and actors
   of small RNA pathways also suggest additional, global epigenetic
   alterations that remain to be characterized. Are these events a cause or
   a consequence of cellular differentiation, and how do they contribute to
   cell fate transition? Does chromatin dynamics induce competence for
   immediate cellular functions (meiosis, fertilization), or does it also
   contribute long-term effects in cellular identity and developmental
   competence of the reproductive lineage? This review attempts to review
   these fascinating questions.}},

   LocationEleven alpine plant communities dominated by cushion plants in
   the Himalayan Hengduan Mountains, within the mountain system of
   south-central China.
   MethodsWe determined plant species richness and abundance in habitats
   created by cushions and cushion-free areas, and assessed the cushion
   effects on species richness and abundance with rarefaction curves and
   the relative interaction index, respectively. We examined the
   relationship between cushion effects on diversity and habitat severity
   and tested if changes in the net cushion effects along the severity
   gradient were due to a change in the performance of species without
   cushions (environmental severity effect) and/or with cushions (nurse
   trait-mediated effect).
   ResultsThe presence of cushion plants increased species richness and
   abundance in most studied plant communities. The net facilitation effect
   of cushions increased with increasing habitat severity, an effect that
   could be attributed mainly to a reduction in species richness in
   cushion-free areas with increasing severity. However, the changes in
   magnitude of facilitation of particular cushion species growing in high
   and low severity habitats could be attributed to both environmental
   severity and neighbour trait effects. Despite the overall positive
   effect of cushion plants on plant species richness, not all cushion
   species contributed to higher species richness. The deviation of
   individual cushion species from the general pattern of increasing
   facilitation with increasing severity indicated the species specificity
   of facilitation depends on the traits of nurse species.
   ConclusionThe presence of cushion plants generally increased species
   richness in alpine plant communities of the Himalayan Hengduan
   Mountains, with the importance of the cushion effect increasing with
   habitat severity due to a buffering effect by cushions of the negative
   effect of habitat severity on species richness observed in cushion-free
   areas. This indicates the pivotal role of facilitative interactions
   among plant species in supporting high diversity in these severe
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Microbes are critical components of ecosystems and provide vital
   services (e.g., photosynthesis, decomposition, nutrient recycling). From
   the diverse roles microbes play in natural ecosystems, high levels of
   functional diversity result. Quantifying this diversity is challenging,
   because it is weakly associated with morphological differentiation. In
   addition, the small size of microbes hinders morphological and
   behavioral measurements at the individual level, as well as interactions
   between individuals. Advances in microbial community genetics and
   genomics, flow cytometry and digital analysis of still images are
   promising approaches. They miss out, however, on a very important aspect
   of populations and communities: the behavior of individuals. Video
   analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance
   and trait measurements, detailed behavioral information, capturing
   dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to
   describe the interactions between individuals. We introduce BEMOVI, a
   package using the R and ImageJ software, to extract abundance,
   morphology, and movement data for tens to thousands of individuals in a
   video. Through a set of functions BEMOVI identifies individuals present
   in a video, reconstructs their movement trajectories through space and
   time, and merges this information into a single database. BEMOVI is a
   modular set of functions, which can be customized to allow for
   peculiarities of the videos to be analyzed, in terms of organisms
   features (e.g., morphology or movement) and how they can be
   distinguished from the background. We illustrate the validity and
   accuracy of the method with an example on experimental multispecies
   communities of aquatic protists. We show high correspondence between
   manual and automatic counts and illustrate how simultaneous time series
   of abundance, morphology, and behavior are obtained from BEMOVI. We
   further demonstrate how the trait data can be used with machine learning
   to automatically classify individuals into species and that information
   on movement behavior improves the predictive ability.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{160}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, multi-temporal topographic measurements from airborne
   laser scanning (ALS) have been increasingly used as a source of
   spatially explicit and accurate information to calculate geodetic
   glacier mass balances. Simultaneous to collecting topographic data, most
   ALS instruments record the backscanered intensity for each laser
   emission and therefore provide additional information on the reflectance
   characteristics of the surveyed surface. Along with air temperature, the
   surface albedo of snow and ice was identified as a major driving factor
   of glacier melt. Consequently, better knowledge on the spatial
   distribution of the glacier albedo could substantially improve energy
   balance based glacier melt modeling. In this study, we collected
   on-glacier spectro-radiometric and albedometer measurements to serve as
   a ground reference to radiometrically calibrate high resolution ALS
   intensity data into a distributed albedo proxy map. This method resulted
   in an albedo proxy with values between 0.6 on the glacier tongue and 0.9
   on fresh snow in high altitudes. 99.6\% of all values fell within the
   albedo boundary conditions, i.e. values between 0 and 1. Corrected
   near-infrared ALS intensity data provided a distributed product that
   allows simulating albedo in glacier energy and mass balance models more
   realistically. Remaining challenges are (i) a different surface albedo
   response in the visual part of the electromagnetic spectrum, (ii) the
   low radiometric resolution of the ALS system for higher intensity
   values, and (iii) an insufficient correction of the snow bi-directional
   reflectance distribution function (BRDF). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Excessive lead burden among golden eagles in the Swiss Alps}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Fragments from lead ammunition pose a poisoning risk for predators like
   golden eagles that scavenge on non-retrieved carcasses or offal left
   behind by hunters. Three golden eagles were found in the Swiss Alps with
   an acute lead poisoning. To investigate whether the few cases of
   lead-poisoned golden eagles are exceptional events or whether a
   substantial proportion of the Alpine golden eagle population is affected
   by lead at sublethal levels, we measured body burdens in golden eagles
   from Switzerland in comparison to eagle owls from the same area and to
   their respective prey. These two raptor species differ in their food as
   eagle owls feed on live-caught prey. Lead levels in soft tissues were
   significantly higher in golden eagles (median 1.14 mu g g(-1) dry weight
   in liver, 0.99 mu g g(-1) in kidney) than in eagle owls (0.14 and 0.23
   mu g g(-1)). Bones of golden eagles contained 10 times more lead (median
   of 12.45 mu g g(-1) dry weight) than owl bones (1.28 mu g g(-1)), which
   represent substantially higher levels than previously reported for
   golden eagles. Bones of prey of both golden eagles and eagle owls had
   low lead concentrations. In order to investigate whether the sublethal
   lead of golden eagles originates from ammunition or from generic
   environmental contamination, we examined lead isotope ratios. Lead
   isotope signatures of golden eagle bones were very similar to those of
   ammunition, but differed from the signatures of bones of their prey,
   eagle owls and soil. Isotope signatures did not change with increasing
   bone lead concentration in golden eagles or any other group examined.
   These findings indicate that in the Alps, most golden eagles take up
   lead from spent ammunition in carcasses or their offal in sublethal
   quantities throughout their life and a few in lethal quantities leading
   to acute lead poisoning.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A challenge for conservation management is to understand how population
   and habitat dynamics interact to affect species persistence. In real
   landscapes, timing and duration of disturbances can vary, and species'
   responses to habitat changes will depend on how timing of dispersal and
   reproduction events relate to the landscape temporal structure. For
   instance, increasing disturbance frequency may promote extinction of
   species that are unable to appropriately time their reproduction in an
   ever-changing habitat and favor species that are able to track habitat
   changes. We developed a mathematical model to compare the effects of
   pulsed dispersal, initiated by shifts in habitat quality, with
   temporally continuous dispersal. We tested the effects of habitat (and
   population) turnover rates on metapopulation establishment, persistence,
   and long-term patch occupancy. Pulsed dispersal reduced patch occupancy
   and metapopulation longevity when habitat patches are relatively
   permanent. In such cases, demographic extinction was the primary form of
   local extinction. Conversely, when habitat patches are short-lived and
   new ones are frequently formed, pulsed dispersal promoted rapid
   colonization, increased occupancy, and prolonged metapopulation
   persistence. Our results show that species responsiveness to habitat
   disturbance is critical to metapopulation persistence, having profound
   implications for the species likely to persist in landscapes with
   altered disturbance regimes.}},

   dissatisfaction with the high levels of public expenditure, transport

Abstract = {{Current characterizations of early dinosaur evolution are incomplete:
   existing palaeobiological and phylogenetic scenarios are based on a
   fossil record dominated by saurischians and the implications of the
   early ornithischian record are often overlooked. Moreover, the timings
   of deep phylogenetic divergences within Dinosauria are poorly
   constrained owing to the absence of a rigorous chronostratigraphical
   framework for key Late Triassic-Early Jurassic localities. A new
   dinosaur from the earliest Jurassic of the Venezuelan Andes is the first
   basal ornithischian recovered from terrestrial deposits directly
   associated with a precise radioisotopic date and the first-named
   dinosaur from northern South America. It expands the early
   palaeogeographical range of Ornithischia to palaeoequatorial regions, an
   area sometimes thought to be devoid of early dinosaur taxa, and offers
   insights into early dinosaur growth rates, the evolution of sociality
   and the rapid tempo of the global dinosaur radiation following the
   end-Triassic mass extinction, helping to underscore the importance of
   the ornithischian record in broad-scale discussions of early dinosaur

Title = {{Holoparasitic Rafflesiaceae possess the most reduced endophytes and yet
   give rise to the world's largest flowers}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Species in the holoparasitic plant family
   Rafflesiaceae exhibit one of the most highly modified vegetative bodies
   in flowering plants. Apart from the flower shoot and associated bracts,
   the parasite is a mycelium-like endophyte living inside their grapevine
   hosts. This study provides a comprehensive treatment of the endophytic
   vegetative body for all three genera of Rafflesiaceae (Rafflesia,
   Rhizanthes and Sapria), and reports on the cytology and development of
   the endophyte, including its structural connection to the host, shedding
   light on the poorly understood nature of this symbiosis.
   Methods Serial sectioning and staining with non-specific dyes,
   periodic-Schiff's reagent and aniline blue were employed in order to
   characterize the structure of the endophyte across a phylogenetically
   diverse sampling.
   Key Results A previously identified difference in the nuclear size
   between Rafflesiaceae endophytes and their hosts was used to investigate
   the morphology and development of the endophytic body. The endophytes
   generally comprise uniseriate filaments oriented radially within the
   host root. The emergence of the parasite from the host during floral
   development is arrested in some cases by an apparent host response, but
   otherwise vegetative growth does not appear to elicit suppression by the
   host.
   Conclusions Rafflesiaceae produce greatly reduced and modified
   vegetative bodies even when compared with the other holoparasitic
   angiosperms once grouped with Rafflesiaceae, which possess some
   vegetative differentiation. Based on previous studies of seeds together
   with these findings, it is concluded that the endophyte probably
   develops directly from a proembryo, and not from an embryo proper.
   Similarly, the flowering shoot arises directly from the undifferentiated
   endophyte. These filaments produce a protocorm in which a shoot apex
   originates endogenously by formation of a secondary morphological
   surface. This degree of modification to the vegetative body is
   exceptional within angiosperms and warrants additional investigation.
   Furthermore, the study highlights a mechanical isolation mechanism by
   which the host may defend itself from the parasite.}},

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1301-1319}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Land-use policies have long been recognized as important driving forces
   of urbanization, but little research has been conducted on the
   interrelationship of actors, policy decision processes and changes in
   the built environment. In this paper, we use the advocacy coalition
   framework to analyse policy decisions that affected the development of
   the built environment in three Swiss municipalities between 1970 and
   2007. We found that all three municipalities experienced the same major
   policy changes, namely a new definition of the role of urban management
   (1970s); the adoption of an environment-and problem-oriented approach in
   land-use planning (1980s) as well as an increased emphasis on public
   participation and intra-municipal coordination (1990s). Although
   national laws and actors have shaped the crucial driving forces of urban
   change, local actors, their coalitions and the local distribution of
   resources crucially determined these decisions in the study period. Our
   findings suggest that a stronger focus on local actors, their coalitions
   and resources could greatly improve our understanding of spatial
   development processes in Switzerland. For instance, as land ownership
   turned out to be a crucial resource, Swiss municipalities could benefit
   from engaging more actively in the land market.}},

Title = {{Multiple hybridization events in Cardamine (Brassicaceae) during the

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{113}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recently formed allopolyploid species represent excellent subjects for
   exploring early stages of polyploid evolution. The hexaploid Cardamine
   schulzii was regarded as one of the few nascent allopolyploid species
   formed within the past 150 years that presumably arose by
   autopolyploidization of a triploid hybrid, C. insueta; however, the most
   recent investigations have shown that it is a trigenomic hybrid. The
   aims of this study were to explore the efficiency of progenitor-specific
   microsatellite markers in detecting the hybrid origins and genome
   composition of these two allopolyploids, to estimate the frequency of
   polyploid formation events, and to outline their evolutionary potential
   for long-term persistence and speciation.
   Flow-cytometric ploidy-level screening and genotyping by
   progenitor-specific microsatellite markers (20 microsatellite loci) were
   carried out on samples focused on hybridizing populations at Urnerboden,
   Switzerland, but also including comparative material of the parental
   species from other sites in the Alps and more distant areas.
   It was confirmed that hybridization between the diploids C. amara and C.
   rivularis auct. gave rise to triploid C. insueta, and it is inferred
   that this has occurred repeatedly. Evidence is provided that C. schulzii
   comprises three parental genomes and supports its origin from
   hybridization events between C. insueta and the locally co-occurring
   hypotetraploid C. pratensis, leading to two cytotypes of C. schulzii:
   hypopentaploid and hypohexaploid. Each cytotype of C. schulzii is
   genetically uniform, suggesting their single origins.
   Persistence of C. schulzii has presumably been achieved only by
   perennial growth and clonal reproduction. This contrasts with C.
   insueta, in which multiple origins and occasional sexual reproduction
   have generated sufficient genetic variation for long-term survival and
   evolutionary success. This study illustrates a complex case of recurrent
   hybridization and polyploidization events, and highlights the role of
   triploids that promoted the origin of trigenomic hybrids.}},

Title = {{Attitudes toward forest diversity and forest ecosystem services-a
   cross-cultural comparison between China and Switzerland}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   Despite the current interest in services provided by ecosystems and the
   role of biodiversity, the relationship among human attitudes,
   biodiversity and ecosystem services has hardly been investigated.
   Moreover, few studies have examined attitudes toward nature in
   cross-cultural comparisons. This study investigates the attitudes of
   Chinese and Swiss people, both environmental experts and laypersons,
   toward forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.
   Methods
   Overall, 640 people in China and Switzerland were interviewed with the
   help of a standardized questionnaire. In each country, the study
   population was equally divided into an urban (80 city dwellers and 80
   environmental science students) and a rural (80 forest visitors and 80
   farmers) study group. The 15-minute interviews took place in the cities
   of Beijing and Zurich and in the rural forested areas of Dujiangyan,
   Sichuan Province and Lake Sempach, canton Lucerne. Attitudes toward
   forest biodiversity were investigated with the help of color photographs
   that depicted both monocultures and species-rich forests typical for
   China and Switzerland. Attitudes toward ecosystem services were
   investigated with the help of 13 statements on provisioning, regulating,
   cultural and supporting services of forests.
   Important Findings
   On average, Chinese participants showed no strong preferences for
   biodiversity, whereas the Swiss clearly preferred species-rich forests
   over monocultures. However, Chinese environmental science students did
   prefer species-rich forests and attributed to them a higher conservation
   value because of their higher biodiversity. Although there were no
   strong preferences for Chinese versus Swiss forests, all participants
   correctly answered that Chinese forests are more species rich in terms
   of plants and animals and thus found them less boring and more
   interesting, but also less managed, than Swiss forests. All participants
   highly valued the ecosystem services provided by forests; especially the
   regulating and supporting ones. Environmental science students and
   farmers placed more importance on the provisioning services, whereas
   city dwellers and forest visitors emphasized more on the regulating
   services. The disjuncture between the high ecological quality of
   species-rich forests and their low attractiveness to Chinese study
   participants points to a potential conflict between conservation
   policies and the public's preferences. A better communication of
   ecosystem services provided by forest biodiversity to the public might
   change these preferences in favor of ecological quality, as already
   observed among Chinese environmental science students.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of a plot-scale methane emission model using eddy covariance
   observations and footprint modelling}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{4651-4664}},
Abstract = {{Most plot-scale methane emission models - of which many have been
   developed in the recent past - are validated using data collected with
   the closed-chamber technique. This method, however, suffers from a low
   spatial representativeness and a poor temporal resolution. Also, during
   a chamber-flux measurement the air within a chamber is separated from
   the ambient atmosphere, which negates the influence of wind on
   emissions.
   Additionally, some methane models are validated by upscaling fluxes
   based on the area-weighted averages of modelled fluxes, and by comparing
   those to the eddy covariance (EC) flux. This technique is rather
   inaccurate, as the area of upscaling might be different from the EC
   tower footprint, therefore introducing significant mismatch.
   In this study, we present an approach to validate plot-scale methane
   models with EC observations using the footprint-weighted average method.
   Our results show that the fluxes obtained by the footprint-weighted
   average method are of the same magnitude as the EC flux. More
   importantly, the temporal dynamics of the EC flux on a daily timescale
   are also captured (r(2) = 0.7). In contrast, using the area-weighted
   average method yielded a low (r(2) = 0.14) correlation with the EC
   measurements. This shows that the footprint-weighted average method is
   preferable when validating methane emission models with EC fluxes for
   areas with a heterogeneous and irregular vegetation pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) plays an important role as a stable
   carbon (C) sink in the soils of terrestrial ecosystems. However,
   uncertainties remain about in situ turnover rates of fire-derived PyOM
   in soil, the main processes leading to PyOM-C and nitrogen (N) losses
   from the soil, and the role of N availability on PyOM cycling in soils.
   We measured PyOM and native soil organic carbon losses from the soil as
   carbon dioxide and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) using additions of
   highly C-13-labelled PyOM (2.03 atom \%) and its precursor pinewood
   during 1 year in a temperate forest soil. The field experiment was
   carried out under ambient and increased mineral N deposition (+60 kg
   N-NH4NO3 ha(-1) year(-1)). The results showed that after 1 year: (1)
   0.5\% of PyOM-C and 22\% of wood-C were mineralized as CO2, leading to
   an estimated turnover time of 191 and 4 years, respectively; (2) the
   quantity of PyOM and wood lost as dissolved organic carbon was
   negligible (0.0004 +/- 0.0003\% and 0.022 +/- 0.007 \% of applied-C,
   respectively); and (3) N additions decreased cumulative PyOM
   mineralization by 43 \%, but did not affect cumulative wood
   mineralization and did not affect the loss of DOC from PyOM or wood. We
   conclude that mineralization to CO2 was the main process leading to PyOM
   losses during the first year of mineralization in a forest soil, and
   that N addition can decrease PyOM-C cycling, while added N showed no
   effect on wood C cycling.}},

Title = {{Carbon transfer, partitioning and residence time in the plant- soil
   system: a comparison of two (CO2)-C-13 labelling techniques}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1637-1648}},
Abstract = {{Various (CO2)-C-13 labelling approaches exist to trace carbon (C)
   dynamics in plant-soil systems. However, it is not clear if the
   different approaches yield the same results. Moreover, there is no
   consistent way of data analysis to date. In this study we compare with
   the same experimental setup the two main techniques: pulse and
   continuous labelling. We evaluate how these techniques perform to
   estimate the C transfer time, the C partitioning along time and the C
   residence time in different plant-soil compartments.
   We used identical plant-soil systems (Populus deltoides x nigra,
   Cambisol soil) to compare the pulse labelling approach (exposure to 99
   atom\% (CO2)-C-13 for three hours, traced for eight days) with a
   continuous labelling (exposure to 10 atom\% (CO2)-C-13, traced for 14
   days). The experiments were conducted in climate chambers under
   controlled environmental conditions. Before label addition and at four
   successive sampling dates, the plant-soil systems were destructively
   harvested, separated into leaves, petioles, stems, cuttings, roots and
   soil and soil microbial biomass was extracted. The soil CO2 efflux was
   sampled throughout the experiment. To model the C dynamics we used an
   exponential function to describe the C-13 signal decline after pulse
   labelling. For the evaluation of the C-13 distribution during the
   continuous labelling we applied a logistic function.
   Pulse labelling is best suited to assess the minimum C transfer time
   from the leaves to other compartments, while continuous labelling can be
   used to estimate the mean transfer time through a compartment, including
   short-term storage pools. The C partitioning between the plant-soil
   compartments obtained was similar for both techniques, but the time of
   sampling had a large effect: shortly after labelling the allocation into
   leaves was overestimated and the soil (CO2)-C-13 efflux underestimated.
   The results of belowground C partitioning were consistent for the two
   techniques only after eight days of labelling, when the C-13 import and
   export was at equilibrium. The C mean residence times estimated by the
   rate constant of the exponential and logistic function were not valid
   here (non-steady state). However, the duration of the accumulation phase
   (continuous labelling) could be used to estimate the C residence time.
   Pulse and continuous labelling techniques are both well suited to assess
   C cycling. With pulse labelling, the dynamics of fresh assimilates can
   be traced, whereas the continuous labelling gives a more integrated
   result of C cycling, due to the homogeneous labelling of C pools and
   fluxes. The logistic model applied here, has the potential to assess
   different parameters of C cycling independent on the sampling date and
   with no disputable assumptions.}},

Title = {{Influence of snow depth distribution on surface roughness in alpine
   terrain: a multi-scale approach}},
Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{547-569}},
Abstract = {{In alpine terrain, the snow-covered winter surface deviates from its
   underlying summer terrain due to the progressive smoothing caused by
   snow accumulation. Terrain smoothing is believed to be an important
   factor in avalanche formation and avalanche dynamics, and it affects
   surface heat transfer, energy balance as well as snow depth
   distribution. To assess the effect of snow on terrain, we use an
   adequate roughness definition. We developed a method to quantify terrain
   smoothing by combining roughness calculations of snow surfaces and their
   corresponding underlying terrain with snow depth measurements. To this
   end, elevation models of winter and summer terrain in three selected
   alpine basins in the Swiss Alps characterized by low, medium and high
   terrain roughness were derived from high-resolution measurements
   performed by airborne and terrestrial lidar. The preliminary results in
   the selected basins reveal that, at basin scale, terrain smoothing
   depends not only on mean snow depth in the basin but also on its
   variability. The multi-temporal analysis over three winter seasons in
   one basin suggests that terrain smoothing can be modelled as a function
   of mean snow depth and its standard deviation using a power law.
   However, a relationship between terrain smoothing and snow depth was not
   found at pixel scale. Further, we show that snow surface roughness is to
   some extent persistent, even in-between winter seasons. Those persistent
   patterns might be very useful to improve the representation of a winter
   terrain without modelling of the snow cover distribution. This can for
   example improve avalanche release area definition and, in the long term,
   natural hazard management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmids carry a wide range of genes that are often involved in
   bacterial social behaviour. The question of why such genes are
   frequently mobile has received increasing attention. Here, we use an
   explicit population genetic approach to model the evolution of
   plasmid-borne bacterial public goods production. Our findings highlight
   the importance of both transmission and relatedness as factors driving
   the evolution of plasmid-borne public goods production. We partition the
   effects of plasmid transfer of social traits into those of infectivity
   and the effect of increased relatedness. Our results demonstrate that,
   owing to its effect on relatedness, plasmid mobility increases the
   invasion and stability of public goods, in a way not seen in
   individually beneficial traits. In addition, we show that plasmid
   transfer increases relatedness when public goods production is rare but
   this effect declines when production is common, with both scenarios
   leading to an increase in the frequency of plasmid-borne public goods.
   Plasmids remain important vectors for the spread of social genes
   involved in bacterial virulence thus an understanding of their dynamics
   is highly relevant from a public health perspective.}},

   extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). EFNs are exceptionally diverse in
   morphology and locations on a plant. In this study the evolution of EFN
   diversity is explored by focusing on the legume genus Senna, in which
   EFNs underwent remarkable morphological diversification and occur in
   over 80 of the approx. 350 species.
   EFN diversity in location, morphology and plant ontogeny was
   characterized in wild and cultivated plants, using scanning electron
   microscopy and microtome sectioning. From these data EFN evolution was
   reconstructed in a phylogenetic framework comprising 83 Senna species.
   Two distinct kinds of EFNs exist in two unrelated clades within Senna.
   Individualized EFNs (iEFNs), located on the compound leaves and
   sometimes at the base of pedicels, display a conspicuous, gland-like
   nectary structure, are highly diverse in shape and characterize the
   species-rich EFN clade. Previously overlooked non-individualized EFNs
   (non-iEFNs) embedded within stipules, bracts, and sepals are cryptic and
   may represent a new synapomorphy for clade II. Leaves bear EFNs
   consistently throughout plant ontogeny. In one species, however, early
   seedlings develop iEFNs between the first pair of leaflets, but later
   leaves produce them at the leaf base. This ontogenetic shift reflects
   our inferred diversification history of iEFN location: ancestral leaves
   bore EFNs between the first pair of leaflets, while leaves derived from
   them bore EFNs either between multiple pairs of leaflets or at the leaf
   base.
   EFNs are more diverse than previously thought. EFN-bearing plant parts
   provide different opportunities for EFN presentation (i.e. location) and
   individualization (i.e. morphology), with implications for EFN
   morphological evolution, EFNant protective mutualisms and the
   evolutionary role of EFNs in plant diversification.}},

Title = {{Fusion within and between whorls of floral organs in Galipeinae

Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Most genera of the neotropical Galipeinae (tribe Galipeeae, Rutoideae)
   exhibit several forms and degrees of fusion between the floral organs,
   including the union of petals into an apparently sympetalous corolla,
   the joining of the stamens among themselves and to the corolla, and the
   partial to complete connation of carpels. Though these and others floral
   traits are currently used in the circumscription of species in
   Galipeinae, few studies have shown in detail in which way (postgenital
   or congenital) and to what extent these fusions occur. To elucidate
   these anatomical conditions, a structural study of the flowers of the
   Galipeinae species was carried out.
   Flowers of six species from three genera of Galipeinae were studied in
   their morphology, anatomy and development with stereomicroscopy, light
   microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
   The floral tube is formed by synorganization of stamens with petals in
   all species, and exhibits three main patterns: (1) Conchocarpus
   heterophyllus and C. minutiflorus have a floral tube formed by marginal
   coherence/adherence of petals and filaments due to interwining trichomes
   (postgenital connection); (2) Erythrochiton brasiliensis has a tube
   formed by congenital fusion of petals and filaments; and (3) Galipea
   jasminiflora and Conchocarpus macrophyllus have a tube formed distally
   with the first pattern, and proximally with the second pattern. Although
   floral tubes seem to be homologous within Galipeinae, this is not true
   at the level of the family: the floral tube of Correa (from an only
   distantly related clade of the family) is formed by postgenital union of
   the petals representing a convergent structure. The gynoecium of the
   studied species of Galipeinae shows a great variability in the extent of
   fusion of carpel flanks. Even though different structures for the mature
   gynoecium were found in each genus, all genera show postgenitally fused
   carpel apices, which is related to the formation of a compitum, as
   described earlier for other members of Rutaceae.
   The degree and diversity of fusions of floral organs in Galipeinae is
   unique within the order Sapindales. A study of the amount of
   diversification of Galipeinae in South America and comparison with other
   clades of Rutaceae would be of interest.}},

Abstract = {{Studies in experimental grasslands have extensively documented the
   effects of sown plant diversity on the colonization of new species, but
   the responses of the sown plant combinations themselves have rarely been
   investigated. We established experimental grasslands differing in
   species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16) and functional group number and
   composition (1-4; legumes, grasses, small herbs, tall herbs), and we
   studied the changes in the abundance of sown species (residents) in both
   weeded and non-weeded subplots over a period of five years after sowing.
   The accumulation of new species through spontaneous colonization in the
   non-weeded treatment did not affect the number of resident species, but
   had increasingly negative effects over time on the cover of resident
   species and their aboveground biomass production at community level.
   Temporal stability of resident populations was lower and year-to-year
   changes in resident species composition were larger in non-weeded than
   in weeded subplots. Compositional dissimilarity between weeded and
   non-weeded treatments increased through time. These negative effects of
   the colonization of new species on the abundances and stability of
   resident populations depended on resident species identity and not on
   additional variation between different functional groups. The
   colonization of new species did not change the number of resident
   species emerging from seeds, but reduced seedling densities of
   residents. Colonization did not affect the structure of resident
   communities as measured by species evenness, functional trait diversity
   and mean trait values suggesting that colonization can destabilize the
   species composition of residents in terms of abundance while leaving
   them unchanged in terms of functional characteristics. Generally,
   negative impacts of colonizing species on residents which accelerated
   through time decreased with an increasing number of sown species. Sowing
   more diverse grassland mixtures increases their predictability in terms
   of ecosystem characteristics, which is important for ecological
   restoration and sustainable agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Biological collections are increasingly becoming databased and available
   for novel types of study. A possible limitation of these data, which has
   the potential to confound analyses based on them, is their biased
   composition due to non-random and opportunistic collecting efforts.
   While geographic biases are comparatively well studied and understood,
   very little attention has been directed at other potential biases. We
   used Asteraceae specimen data from Australia's Virtual Herbarium to test
   for over- and under-representation of plants with specific morphology,
   phenology and status by comparing observed numbers of specimens against
   a null distribution of simulated collections. Strong collecting biases
   could be demonstrated against introduced plants, plants with green or
   brown inflorescences, and very small plants. Specimens belonging to
   species with very restricted areas of distribution were also found to be
   strongly underrepresented. A moderate bias was observed against plants
   flowering in summer. While spiny plants have been collected only about
   half as often as should be expected, much of this bias was due to nearly
   all of them also being introduced (thistles). When introduced species
   were analyzed alone, a negative effect of spines remained but was much
   more moderate. The effect of woody or herbaceous habit, other
   inflorescence colours, tall growth and size of the capitula was
   comparatively negligible. Our results indicate that care should be taken
   when relying on specimen databases or the herbaria themselves for
   studies examining phenology, resource availability for pollinators, or
   the distribution and abundance of exotic species, and that researchers
   should be aware of collecting biases against small and unattractively
   coloured plants.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid zones provide excellent opportunities to study processes and
   mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation and speciation. Here we
   investigated sex-specific clines of molecular markers in hybrid zones of
   morphologically cryptic yet genetically highly-diverged evolutionary
   lineages of the European common vole (Microtus arvalis). We analyzed the
   position and width of four secondary contact zones along three
   independent transects in the region of the Alps using maternally
   (mitochondrial DNA) and paternally (Y-chromosome) inherited genetic
   markers. Given male-biased dispersal in the common vole, a selectively
   neutral secondary contact would show broader paternal marker clines than
   maternal ones. In a selective case, for example, involving a form of
   Haldane's rule, Y-chromosomal clines would not be expected to be broader
   than maternal markers because they are transmitted by the heterogametic
   sex and thus gene flow would be restricted. Consistent with the
   selective case, paternal clines were significantly narrower or at most
   equal in width to maternal clines in all contact zones. In addition,
   analyses using maximum likelihood cline-fitting detected a shift of
   paternal relative to maternal clines in three of four contact zones.
   These patterns suggest that processes at the contact zones in the common
   vole are not selectively neutral, and that partial reproductive
   isolation is already established between these evolutionary lineages. We
   conclude that hybrid zone movement, sexual selection and/or genetic
   incompatibilities are likely associated with an unusual unidirectional
   manifestation of Haldane's rule in this common European mammal. Heredity

Abstract = {{This study presents a method that allows continuous monitoring of mass
   balance for remote or inaccessible glaciers, based on repeated oblique
   photography. Hourly to daily pictures from two automatic cameras
   overlooking two large valley glaciers in the Swiss Alps are available
   for eight ablation seasons (2004-11) in total. We determine the fraction
   of snow-covered glacier surface from orthorectified and georeferenced
   images and combine this information with simple accumulation and melt
   modelling using meteorological data. By applying this approach, the
   evolution of glacier-wide mass balance throughout the ablation period
   can be directly calculated, based on terrestrial remote-sensing data.
   Validation against independent in situ mass-balance observations
   indicates good agreement. Our methodology has considerable potential for
   the remote determination of mountain glacier mass balance at high
   temporal resolution and could be applied using both repeated terrestrial
   and air-/spaceborne observations.}},

Title = {{Exploiting empirical knowledge for automatic delineation of city centres
   from large-scale topographic databases}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{18-34}},

Abstract = {{Current topographic databases rarely represent higher order geographic
   phenomena, such as city centres. However, such concepts are often
   referred to by humans and used in various forms of spatial analysis.
   Hence, the value and usability of topographic databases can greatly be
   improved by methods that automatically create such higher order
   phenomena through cartographic pattern recognition techniques, departing
   from the very detailed, geometry-oriented representations of topographic
   databases. As many higher order phenomena are only vaguely defined, this
   paper develops and evaluates a methodology to acquire definitional
   knowledge about geographic phenomena by participant experiments and use
   this knowledge to drive the cartographic pattern recognition process.
   The method is applied to acquire knowledge about British city centres
   and delineate referents of city centre from topographic data. City
   centres produced for ten British cities are compared to areas derived
   from alternative sources. F-1-scores between 0.45 and 0.88 are achieved,
   suggesting that the delineation produced plausible city centre areas.
   The benefits of our work are better (and user-driven) descriptions of
   complex geographic phenomena that can form the basis for accurately
   enriching topographic databases with additional semantics, thus yielding
   added value for the data producer and the end user. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Agronomically important traits are frequently controlled by rare,
   genotype-specific alleles. Such genes can only be mapped in a population
   derived from the donor genotype. This requires the development of a
   specific genetic map, which is difficult in wheat because of the low
   level of polymorphism among elite cultivars. The absence of sufficient
   polymorphism, the complexity of the hexaploid wheat genome as well as
   the lack of complete sequence information make the construction of
   genetic maps with a high density of reproducible and polymorphic markers
   challenging. We developed a genotype-specific genetic map of chromosome
   3B from winter wheat cultivars Arina and Forno. Chromosome 3B was
   isolated from the two cultivars and then sequenced to 10-fold coverage.
   This resulted in a single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) database of the
   complete chromosome. Based on proposed synteny with the Brachypodium
   model genome and gene annotation, sequences close to coding regions were
   used for the development of 70 SNP-based markers. They were mapped on a
   ArinaxForno Recombinant Inbred Lines population and found to be spread
   over the complete chromosome 3B. While overall synteny was well
   maintained, numerous exceptions and inversions of syntenic gene order
   were identified. Additionally, we found that the majority of
   recombination events occurred in distal parts of chromosome 3B,
   particularly in hot-spot regions. Compared with the earlier map based on
   SSR and RFLP markers, the number of markers increased fourfold. The
   approach presented here allows fast development of genotype-specific
   polymorphic markers that can be used for mapping and marker-assisted
   selection.}},

Title = {{Best practice in research: Consensus Statement on Ethnopharmacological
   Field Studies - ConSEFS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{211}},
Pages = {{329-339}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Ethnopharmacological research aims at gathering information
   on local and traditional uses of plants and other natural substances.
   However, the approaches used and the methods employed vary, and while
   such a variability is desirable in terms of scientific diversity,
   research must adhere to well defined quality standards and reproducible
   methods
   Objectives: With ConSEFS (the Consensus Statement on
   Ethnopharmacological Field Studies) we want to define best-practice in
   developing, conducting and reporting field studies focusing on local and
   traditional uses of medicinal and food plants, including studies using a
   historical approach.
   Methods: After first developing an initial draft the core group invited
   community-wide feedback from researchers both through a web-based
   consultation and a series of workshops at conferences during 2017.
   Outcomes: The consultation resulted in a large number of responses.
   Feedback was received via a weblink on the Journal of
   Ethnopharmacology's website (ca. 100 responses), other oral and written
   responses (ca. 50) and discussions with stakeholders at four
   conferences. The main outcome is a checklist, covering best practice for
   designing, implementing and recording ethnopharmacological field studies
   and historical studies.
   Conclusions: Prior to starting ethnopharmacological field research, it
   is essential that the authors are fully aware of the best practice in
   the field. For the first time in the field of ethnopharmacology a
   community-wide document defines guidelines for best practice on how to
   conduct and report such studies. It will need to be updated and further
   developed. While the feedback has been based on responses by many
   experienced researchers, there is a need to test it in practice by using
   it both in implementing and reporting field studies (or historical
   studies), and peer-review.}},

Title = {{Impacts of salvage logging on biodiversity: A meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{279-289}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Logging to ``salvage{''} economic returns from forests affected by
   natural disturbances has become increasingly prevalent globally. Despite
   potential negative effects on biodiversity, salvage logging is often
   conducted, even in areas otherwise excluded from logging and reserved
   for nature conservation, inter alia because strategic priorities for
   post-disturbance management are widely lacking.
   2. A review of the existing literature revealed that most studies
   investigating the effects of salvage logging on biodiversity have been
   conducted less than 5years following natural disturbances, and focused
   on non-saproxylic organisms.
   3. A meta-analysis across 24 species groups revealed that salvage
   logging significantly decreases numbers of species of eight taxonomic
   groups. Richness of dead wood dependent taxa (i.e. saproxylic organisms)
   decreased more strongly than richness of non-saproxylic taxa. In
   contrast, taxonomic groups typically associated with open habitats
   increased in the number of species after salvage logging.
   4. By analysing 134 original species abundance matrices, we demonstrate
   that salvage logging significantly alters community composition in 7 of
   17 species groups, particularly affecting saproxylic assemblages.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that salvage logging
   is not consistent with the management objectives of protected areas.
   Substantial changes, such as the retention of dead wood in naturally
   disturbed forests, are needed to support biodiversity. Future research
   should investigate the amount and spatio-temporal distribution of
   retained dead wood needed to maintain all components of biodiversity.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Forest dieback caused by drought-induced tree mortality has been
   observed world-wide. Forecasting which trees in which locations are
   vulnerable to drought-induced mortality is important to predict the
   consequences of drought on forest structure, biodiversity and ecosystem
   function.
   2. In this paper, our central aim was to compile a synthesis of tree
   traits and associated abiotic variables that can be used to predict
   drought-induced mortality.
   3. We reviewed the literature that specifically links drought mortality
   to functional traits and site conditions (i.e. edaphic variables and
   biotic conditions), targeting studies that show clear use of tree traits
   in drought analysis. We separated the review into five climatic zones to
   determine global vs. regionally restricted relationships between traits
   and mortality.
   4. Our synthesis identifies a number of traits that have clear
   relationships with drought-induced mortality (e.g. wood density at the
   species level and tree size and growth at the individual level).
   However, the lack of direct relationships between most traits and
   drought-induced mortality highlights areas where future research should
   focus to broaden our understanding.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our synthesis highlights established
   relationships between traits and drought-induced mortality, presents
   knowledge gaps for future research focus and suggests monitoring and
   research avenues for improving our understanding of drought-induced
   mortality. It is intended to assist ecologists and natural resource
   managers choose appropriate and measurable parameters for predicting
   local and regional scale tree mortality risk in different climatic zones
   within constraints of time and funding availability.}},

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical models predict that the evolutionary diversification
   of the weapons and ornaments of pre-mating sexual selection should be
   influenced by trade-offs with male expenditure on ejaculates. However,
   the patterns of association between secondary sexual traits and
   ejaculate expenditure are frequently inconsistent in their support of
   this prediction. We show why consideration of additional life-history,
   ecological, and mating-system variables is crucial for the
   interpretation of associations between secondary sexual traits and
   ejaculate production. Incorporation of these `missing variables'

Abstract = {{Comparative studies have identified a wide range of behavioural and
   ecological correlates of relative brain size, with results differing
   between taxonomic groups, and even within them. In primates for example,
   recent studies contradict one another over whether social or ecological
   factors are critical. A basic assumption of such studies is that with
   sufficiently large samples and appropriate analysis, robust correlations
   indicative of selection pressures on cognition will emerge. We carried
   out a comprehensive re-examination of correlates of primate brain size
   using two large comparative datasets and phylogenetic comparative
   methods. We found evidence in both datasets for associations between
   brain size and ecological variables (home range size, diet and activity
   period), but little evidence for an effect of social group size, a
   correlation which has previously formed the empirical basis of the
   Social Brain Hypothesis. However, reflecting divergent results in the
   literature, our results exhibited instability across datasets, even when
   they were matched for species composition and predictor variables. We
   identify several potential empirical and theoretical difficulties
   underlying this instability and suggest that these issues raise doubts
   about inferring cognitive selection pressures from behavioural
   correlates of brain size.}},

Abstract = {{Most terrestrial plants, including crops, engage in beneficial
   interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Vital to the association
   is mutual recognition involving the release of diffusible signals into
   the rhizosphere. Previously, we identified the maize no perception 1
   (nope1) mutant to be defective in early signalling. Here, we report
   cloning of ZmNope1 on the basis of synteny with rice. NOPE1 encodes a
   functional homologue of the Candida albicans N-acetylglucosamine
   (GlcNAc) transporter NGT1, and represents the first plasma membrane
   GlcNAc transporter identified from plants. In C. albicans, exposure to
   GlcNAc activates cell signalling and virulence. Similarly, in
   Rhizophagus irregularis treatment with rice wild-type but not nope1 root
   exudates induced transcriptome changes associated with signalling
   function, suggesting a requirement of NOPE1 function for presymbiotic
   fungal reprogramming.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Explaining the enormous biodiversity observed in bacterial communities
   is challenging because ecological theory predicts that competition
   between species occupying the same niche should lead to the exclusion of
   less competitive community members. Competitive exclusion should be
   particularly strong when species compete for a single limiting resource
   or live in unstructured habitats that offer no refuge for weaker
   competitors. Here, we describe the `cheating effect', a form of
   intra-specific competition that can counterbalance between-species
   competition, thereby fostering biodiversity in unstructured habitats.
   Using experimental communities consisting of the strong competitor
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and its weaker counterpart Burkholderia
   cenocepacia (BC), we show that co-existence is impossible when the two
   species compete for a single limiting resource, iron. However, when
   introducing a PA cheating mutant, which specifically exploits the
   iron-scavenging siderophores produced by the PA wild type, we found that
   biodiversity was preserved under well-mixed conditions where PA cheats
   could outcompete the PA wild type. Cheating fosters biodiversity in our
   system because it creates strong intra-specific competition, which
   equalizes fitness differences between PA and BC. Our study identifies
   cheating - typically considered a destructive element - as a
   constructive force in shaping biodiversity.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{189}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{368-380}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The biotic and abiotic factors that facilitate or hinder species range
   expansions are many and complex. We examine the impact of two genetic
   processes and their interaction on fitness at expanding range edges:
   local maladaptation resulting from the presence of an environmental
   gradient and expansion load resulting from increased genetic drift at
   the range edge. Results from spatially explicit simulations indicate
   that the presence of an environmental gradient during range expansion
   reduces expansion load; conversely, increasing expansion load allows
   only locally adapted populations to persist at the range edge. Increased
   maladaptation reduces the speed of range expansion, resulting in less
   genetic drift at the expanding front and more immigration from the range
   center, therefore reducing expansion load at the range edge. These
   results may have ramifications for species being forced to shift their
   ranges because of climate change or other anthropogenic changes. If
   rapidly changing climate leads to faster expansion as populations track
   their shifting climatic optima, populations may suffer increased
   expansion load beyond previous expectations.}},

Abstract = {{Maize (corn) is one of the most widely grown cereal crops globally.
   Fungal diseases of maize cause significant economic damage by reducing
   maize yields and by increasing input costs for disease management. The
   most sustainable control of maize diseases is through the release and
   planting of maize cultivars with durable disease resistance. The wheat
   gene Lr34 provides durable and partial field resistance against multiple
   fungal diseases of wheat, including three wheat rust pathogens and wheat
   powdery mildew. Because of its unique qualities, Lr34 became a
   cornerstone in many wheat disease resistance programmes. The Lr34
   resistance is encoded by a rare variant of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
   transporter that evolved after wheat domestication. An Lr34-like disease
   resistance phenotype has not been reported in other cereal species,
   including maize. Here, we transformed the Lr34 resistance gene into the
   maize hybrid Hi-II. Lr34-expressing maize plants showed increased
   resistance against the biotrophic fungal disease common rust and the
   hemi-biotrophic disease northern corn leaf blight. Furthermore, the
   Lr34-expressing maize plants developed a late leaf tip necrosis
   phenotype, without negative impact on plant growth. With this and
   previous reports, it could be shown that Lr34 is effective against
   various biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic diseases that collectively
   parasitize all major cereal crop species.}},

Abstract = {{AimGiven its catastrophic consequences, the extinction of apex predators
   has long been of interest to modern ecology. Despite major declines, no
   present-day species of marine apex predator has yet become extinct.
   Because of their vulnerability, understanding the mechanisms leading to
   their extinction in the past could provide insight into the natural
   factors that interact with human threats to drive their loss. We studied
   the geographical distribution patterns of the extinct macro-predatory
   shark Carcharocles megalodon in order to elucidate its pathway to
   extinction.
   LocationWorld-wide from the Miocene to the Pliocene (c.23-2.6Ma).
   MethodsA meta-analysis of C.megalodon occurrence records was performed
   using the Paleobiology Database as a platform. The data were binned into
   geological time slices, and the circular home range around each data
   point was mapped in reconstructions made in GPlates. We then
   quantitatively assessed the species' geographical range and global
   abundance over time, and the relationship between distribution and
   climate.
   ResultsThe pathway to extinction of C.megalodon probably started in the
   late Miocene with a decrease in its global abundance. This decrease was
   then followed by a decline in its geographical range during the
   Pliocene. Although the extinction of C.megalodon has been attributed to
   climate change, we found no evidence of direct effects of global
   temperature. Instead, we found that the collapse in geographical
   distribution coincided mainly with a drop in the diversity of
   filter-feeding whales and the appearance of new competitors (large
   predatory whales and the great white shark).
   Main conclusionsThis research represents the first study of the
   distributional trends of an extinct, cosmopolitan apex predator in
   deep-time. Our results suggest that biotic factors, and not direct
   temperature limitations, were probably the primary drivers of the
   extinction of the largest marine apex predators that ever lived.}},

Title = {{The ethical stakes in monetary valuation methods for conservation
   purposes}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{199}},
Pages = {{67-74}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The involvement of economic approaches is increasingly pervasive in
   conservation practices, from environmental policies to procedures
   determining the choice of conservation projects. The literature on the
   ethical weaknesses of economic approaches suggests to question the
   self-evidence of these interactions. However, economics encompasses a
   variety of approaches and methods, with unclear ethical underpinnings.
   This article contributes to these debates through a
   focused-clarification of the ethical presuppositions of monetary
   valuations methods. This choice reflects that monetary valuation studies
   are expanding and provide numerous opportunities of interactions with
   conservation biologists. Identifying and understanding their ethical
   presuppositions is therefore pivotal for conservation biologists. For
   that purpose, we provide a glossary of the ethical concepts underpinning
   the current monetary valuation methods. We show that using a given
   monetary valuation method commits to endorse specific ethical stances.
   We then develop a practical case study: the conservation of a population
   of the endangered plant Leucanthemum burnatii Briq. \& Cav. in a
   semi-natural site in the French Alps. We describe the steps that a
   conservation biologist could follow to decide whether she should seize
   opportunities to work with economists implementing monetary valuations
   in this setting. These stepping stones structure the approach that
   conservation biologists can deploy to identify the ethical stakes of
   conservation/economics interactions. This approach can also-prove useful
   for conservation biologists to reflexively clarify their own ethical
   motivations. By appropriating this approach, conservation biologists can
   equip themselves to enter public debates to legitimize the usage of
   scientific results to improve collective decision-making on conservation
   issues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A 11-m-long lake sediment core of a mountain lake situated at 1225m
   a.s.l. in the Karkonosze Mountains (Poland) provided a unique,
   multi-proxy archive to reconstruct natural and human-induced
   environmental changes over the entire Holocene period. Pollen analyses
   allowed for the local and regional reconstruction of vegetation history.
   The chemical composition of the core and the determination of amorphous
   Fe and Al phases enabled to trace back soil formation in the surrounding
   catchment. About 11 ka ago, birch-pine and pine-birch communities
   started to develop in the Preboreal chronozone. Subsequently, the
   vegetation cover changed to Corylus-Picea-Abies+Fagus in the higher and
   middle mountain zones, and to Ulmus-Quercus-Carpinus in the mountain
   foreland and footslopes. The decline of forests that started in the 11th
   century because of clearing was accompanied by the expansion of grasses,
   both as pastures in the mountains and cereal crops in the foreland. At
   the same time, the mining and smelting gave rise to environmental
   pollution with heavy metals (Pb, Cu and Zn) at a regional scale.
   Combined geochemical and palynological data indicated relationships
   between vegetation type, sediment texture and its elemental composition.
   This relationship seemed to be linked to climatic conditions and surface
   erosion intensity. A first progressive soil-forming phase occurred from
   10.9 until about 8.4 ka cal. BP. Rapid and strong soil erosion
   (regressive phase), related to rapid climate deterioration, occurred at
   about 8.4 ka cal. BP. Thereafter, continuous soil formation (progressive
   phase) and podzolization in the Boreal and Atlantic continued until
   about 1 ka BP when strong human impact (deforestation) led again to a
   regressive soil evolution.}},

Title = {{Plastic and evolutionary responses to heat stress in a temperate dung
   fly: negative correlation between basal and induced heat tolerance?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Extreme weather events such as heat waves are becoming more frequent and
   intense. Populations can cope with elevated heat stress by evolving
   higher basal heat tolerance (evolutionary response) and/or stronger
   induced heat tolerance (plastic response). However, there is ongoing
   debate about whether basal and induced heat tolerance are negatively
   correlated and whether adaptive potential in heat tolerance is
   sufficient under ongoing climate warming. To evaluate the evolutionary
   potential of basal and induced heat tolerance, we performed experimental
   evolution on a temperate source population of the dung fly Sepsis
   punctum. Offspring of flies adapted to three thermal selection regimes
   (Hot, Cold and Reference) were subjected to acute heat stress after
   having been exposed to either a hot-acclimation or non-acclimation
   pretreatment. As different traits may respond differently to temperature
   stress, several physiological and life history traits were assessed.
   Condition dependence of the response was evaluated by exposing juveniles
   to different levels of developmental (food restriction/rearing density)
   stress. Heat knockdown times were highest, whereas acclimation effects
   were lowest in the Hot selection regime, indicating a negative
   association between basal and induced heat tolerance. However, survival,
   adult longevity, fecundity and fertility did not show such a pattern.
   Acclimation had positive effects in heat-shocked flies, but in the
   absence of heat stress hot-acclimated flies had reduced life spans
   relative to non-acclimated ones, thereby revealing a potential cost of
   acclimation. Moreover, body size positively affected heat tolerance and
   unstressed individuals were less prone to heat stress than stressed
   flies, offering support for energetic costs associated with heat
   tolerance. Overall, our results indicate that heat tolerance of
   temperate insects can evolve under rising temperatures, but this
   response could be limited by a negative relationship between basal and
   induced thermotolerance, and may involve some but not other
   fitness-related traits.}},

Title = {{Individual-level trait diversity concepts and indices to comprehensively

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{808-818}},

Abstract = {{1. Global environmental change can influence ecosystem processes
   directly or through changes in the trait composition of natural
   communities. Traits are individual-level features of organisms, and
   theory predicts that diversity in traits should relate to ecosystem
   processes. Validated indices that account for both intra- and
   interspecific trait variation in multidimensional trait space are
   lacking. In this article, we highlight how an individual-level
   perspective requires new concepts for trait diversity (TD) and we
   validate a set of measures suitable to study trait richness, evenness
   and divergence at the individual scale.
   2. First, we tested a selection of multivariate indices for trait
   richness, evenness and divergence from the literature (FRic, FEve, FDis
   and the Rao coefficient) using simulated and real individual-level data.
   We compared the observed changes in the tested indices with those
   predicted from their expected/required behaviour (i.e. increase or
   decrease under specific manipulation of community trait structure) and
   found unsatisfactory results only for FRic and FEve, whereas FDis and
   the Rao coefficient showed the expected changes.
   3. Therefore, we propose two novel concepts and related indices for
   individual-level trait richness (TOP = trait onion peeling) and evenness
   (TED = trait even distribution). TOP represents the sum of all
   successive convex hull areas touching all individuals (points) within a
   multidimensional trait distribution. TED is a measure of how evenly
   distributed are individuals within the multidimensional trait space. It
   is calculated comparing the probability distributions of pairwise
   distances between individuals and between points of a perfectly even
   reference distribution. We tested TOP and TED on the same simulated and
   real data as above, and results indicated appropriate behaviour for TOP
   (trait richness) and TED (trait evenness).
   4. By validating TD indices in an individual-level context, this study
   contributes to the expansion of functional ecology towards
   individual-level dynamics. Future comprehensive investigations of
   individual trait differences in natural communities may improve our
   understanding of the pathways by which environmental changes affect
   ecosystem functioning through biodiversity change.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial pattern and morphometry of bedforms and their relationship
   to sediment thickness have been analysed in the Marguerite Bay
   Palaeo-ice stream Trough, western Antarctic Peninsula. Over 17 000
   glacial landforms were measured from geophysical datasets, and sediment
   thickness maps were generated from acoustic sub-bottom profiler data.
   These analyses reveal a complex bedform pattern characterised by
   considerable spatial diversity, influenced heavily by the underlying
   substrate. The variability in length and density of mega-scale
   lineations indicates an evolving bedform signature, whereby landforms
   are preserved at different stages of maturity. Lineation generation and
   attenuation is associated with regions of thick, soft till where
   deformation was likely to be the greatest. The distribution of soft till
   and the localised extent of grounding-zone wedges (GZWs) indicate a
   dynamic sedimentary system characterised by considerable spatio-temporal
   variability in sediment erosion, transport and deposition. Formation of
   GZWs on the outer shelf of Marguerite Trough, within the error range of
   the radiocarbon dates, requires large sediment fluxes (upwards of 1000
   m(3) a(-1) (m grounding line width)(-1)), and a >1 m thick mobile till
   layer, or rapid basal sliding velocities (upwards of 6 km a(-1)).}},

Journal = {{EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{103-123}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, strong variations in the speed of rock glaciers have
   been detected, raising questions about their stability under changing
   climatic conditions. In this study, we present continuous time series of
   surface velocities over 3 years of six GPS stations located on three
   rock glaciers in Switzerland. Intra-annual velocity variations are
   analysed in relation to local meteorological factors, such as
   precipitation, snow(melt), and air and ground surface temperatures. The
   main focus of this study lies on the abrupt velocity peaks, which have
   been detected at two steep and fast-moving rock glacier tongues (>= 5
   ma(-1)), and relationships to external meteorological forcing are
   statistically tested.
   The continuous measurements with high temporal resolution allowed us to
   detect short-term velocity peaks, which occur outside cold winter
   conditions, at these two rock glacier tongues. Our measurements further
   revealed that all rock glaciers experience clear intra-annual variations
   in movement in which the timing and the amplitude is reasonably similar
   in individual years. The seasonal decrease in velocity was typically
   smooth, starting 1-3 months after the seasonal decrease in temperatures,
   and was stronger in years with colder temperatures in mid winter.
   Seasonal acceleration was mostly abrupt and rapid compared to the winter
   deceleration, always starting during the zero curtain period. We found a
   statistically significant relationship between the occurrence of
   short-term velocity peaks and water input from heavy precipitation or
   snowmelt, while no velocity peak could be attributed solely to high
   temperatures. The findings of this study further suggest that, in
   addition to the short-term velocity peaks, the seasonal acceleration is
   also influenced by water infiltration, causing thermal advection and an
   increase in pore water pressure. In contrast, the amount of deceleration
   in winter seems to be mainly controlled by winter temperatures.}},

Title = {{The female gametophyte: an emerging model for cell type-specific systems
   biology in plant development}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Systems biology, a holistic approach describing a system emerging from
   the interactions of its molecular components, critically depends on
   accurate qualitative determination and quantitative measurements of
   these components. Development and improvement of large-scale profiling
   methods ({''}omics{''}) now facilitates comprehensive measurements of
   many relevant molecules. For multicellular organisms, such as animals,
   fungi, algae, and plants, the complexity of the system is augmented by
   the presence of specialized cell types and organs, and a complex
   interplay within and between them. Cell type-specific analyses are
   therefore crucial for the understanding of developmental processes and
   environmental responses. This review first gives an overview of current
   methods used for large-scale profiling of specific cell types
   exemplified by recent advances in plant biology. The focus then lies on
   suitable model systems to study plant development and cell type
   specification. We introduce the female gametophyte of flowering plants
   as an ideal model to study fundamental developmental processes.
   Moreover, the female reproductive lineage is of importance for the
   emergence of evolutionary novelties such as an unequal parental
   contribution to the tissue nurturing the embryo or the clonal production
   of seeds by asexual reproduction (apomixis). Understanding these
   processes is not only interesting from a developmental or evolutionary
   perspective, but bears great potential for further crop improvement and
   the simplification of breeding efforts. We finally highlight novel
   methods, which are already available or which will likely soon
   facilitate large-scale profiling of the specific cell types of the
   female gametophyte in both model and non-model species. We conclude that
   it may take only few years until an evolutionary systems biology
   approach toward female gametogenesis may decipher some of its
   biologically most interesting and economically most valuable processes.}},

Abstract = {{Polymorphic warning signals in aposematic species are enigmatic because
   predator learning and discrimination should select for the most common
   coloration, resulting in positive frequency-dependent survival
   selection. Here, we investigated whether differential mating success
   could create sufficiently strong negative frequency-dependent selection
   for rare morphs to explain polymorphic (white and yellow) warning
   coloration in male wood tiger moths (Parasemia plantaginis). We
   conducted an experiment in semi-natural conditions where we estimated
   mating success for both white and yellow male moths under three
   different morph frequencies. Contrary to expectations, mating success
   was positively frequency-dependent: white morph males had high relative
   fitness when common, likewise yellow morph males had high relative
   fitness when instead they were common. We hence built a model
   parameterized with our data to examine whether polymorphism can be
   maintained despite two sources of positive frequency dependence. The
   model includes known spatial variation in the survival advantage enjoyed
   by the yellow morph and assumes that relative mating success follows our
   experimentally derived values. It predicts that polymorphism is possible
   under migration for up to approximately 20\% exchange of individuals
   between subpopulations in each generation. Our results suggest that
   differential mating success combined with spatial variation in predator
   communities may operate as a selection mosaic that prevents complete
   fixation of either morph.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{5726-5738}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Kin recognition is a critical element to kin cooperation, and in
   vertebrates, it is primarily based on associative learning. Recognition
   of socially unfamiliar kin occurs rarely, and it is reported only in
   vertebrate species where promiscuity prevents recognition of first-order
   relatives. However, it is unknown whether the recognition of socially
   unfamiliar kin can evolve in monogamous species. Here, we investigate
   whether genetic relatedness modulates aggression among group members in
   Siberian jays (Perisoreus infaustus). This bird species is genetically
   and socially monogamous and lives in groups that are formed through the
   retention of offspring beyond independence, and the immigration of
   socially unfamiliar nonbreeders. Observations on feeders showed that
   genetic relatedness modulated aggression of breeders towards immigrants
   in a graded manner, in that they chased most intensely the immigrant
   group members that were genetically the least related. However,
   cross-fostering experiments showed that breeders were equally tolerant
   towards their own and cross-fostered young swapped as nestlings. Thus,
   breeders seem to use different mechanisms to recognize socially
   unfamiliar individuals and own offspring. As Siberian jays show a high
   degree of nepotism during foraging and predator encounters, inclusive
   fitness benefits may play a role for the evolution of fine-scale kin
   recognition. More generally, our results suggest that fine-graded kin
   recognition can evolve independently of social familiarity, highlighting
   the evolutionary importance of kin recognition for social species.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the angular effects causing spectral distortions
   in multi-angle remote sensing imagery. We study two WorldView-2
   multispectral in-track sequences acquired over the cities of Atlanta,
   USA, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, consisting of 13 and 20 co-located
   images, respectively. The sequences possess off-nadir acquisition angles
   up to 47.5 degrees and bear markedly different sun-satellite
   configurations with respect to each other. Both scenes comprise classic
   urban structures such as buildings of different size, road networks, and
   parks. First, we quantify the degree of distortion affecting the
   sequences by means of a non-linear measure of distance between
   probability distributions, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. Second, we
   assess the ability of a classification model trained on an image
   acquired at a certain view angle to predict the land-cover of all the
   other images in the sequence. The portability across the sequence is
   investigated for supervised classifiers of different nature by analyzing
   the evolution of the classification accuracy with respect to the
   off-nadir look angle. For both datasets, the effectiveness of
   physically- and statistically-based normalization methods in obtaining
   angle-invariant data spaces is compared and synergies are discussed. The

Title = {{Patterns of angiospermy development before carpel sealing across living
   angiosperms: diversity, and morphological and systematic aspects}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{178}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Almost all angiosperms are angiospermous, i.e. the ovules are enclosed
   in carpels at anthesis and during seed development, but angiospermy
   develops in different ways across angiosperms. The most common means of
   carpel closure is by a longitudinal ventral slit in carpels that are
   partly or completely free. In such carpels, the closure process commonly
   begins at midlength of the prospective longitudinal slit and then
   proceeds downward and upward. Closure by a transverse slit is rarer, but
   it is prominent in groups of the ANITA grade and in a few early
   branching monocots (some Alismatales) and some early branching eudicots
   (a few Ranunculaceae and Nelumbonaceae), in these eudicots combined with
   a more or less developed longitudinal slit. In all these cases the
   carpels have a single ovule in ventral median position. In ANITA lines
   with pluriovulate carpels, there is only a short longitudinal slit in
   the uniformly ascidiate carpels. In carpels with a unifacial style the
   closure area is narrow; this pattern is rare and scattered mainly in
   some wind-pollinated monocots and eudicots. In most angiosperms the
   carpels become closed before the ovules are visible from the outside of
   the still incompletely closed carpels (early carpel closure). This is
   notably the case in the ANITA grade and magnoliids. Delayed carpel
   closure, with the ovules visible before the carpels are closed, is much
   rarer and is concentrated in a few monocots (mainly some Alismatales and
   some Poales) and a few eudicots (mainly a few Ranunculales and many
   Caryophyllales, and scattered in some other eudicots). A kind of delayed
   carpel closure (with the placenta visible before closure but mostly not
   the ovules) also occurs in syncarpous gynoecia with a free central
   placenta. Most gynoecia with a free central placenta occur in the
   superasterids. In such gynoecia the individual carpel tips are not
   differentiated but the opening in young gynoecia has the shape of a
   circular diaphragm. In this case, when ovary septa and free carpel tips
   are missing, the number of carpels is sometimes unclear (Primulaceae,
   Lentibulariaceae, some Santalaceae). Extremely ascidiate carpels are
   concentrated in the ANITA grade, a few magnoliids and some early
   branching monocots. Aspects of potential advantages of plicate vs.
   ascidiate carpels with regard to flexibility of pollen tube transmitting
   tract differentiation are discussed.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of

Abstract = {{Canids are definitive hosts of Taenia and Echinococcus species, which
   infect a variety of mammals as intermediate or accidental hosts
   including humans. Parasite transmission is based on domestic,
   semidomestic and wildlife cycles; however, little is known of the
   epidemiological significance of wild large definitive hosts such as the
   wolf. In this study, 179 scats of wolves (Canis lupus italicus)
   collected throughout the Italian region of Liguria were analyzed for the
   detection of taeniid infection. Taeniid egg isolation was performed
   using a sieving/flotation technique, and the species level was
   identified by PCR (gene target: 12S rRNA and nad 1) followed by sequence
   analyses. Based on sequence homologies of >= 99\%, Taenia hydatigena was
   identified in 19.6\%, Taenia krabbei in 4.5\%, Taenia ovis in 2.2\%,
   Taenia crassiceps in 0.6\%, Hydatigera taeniaeformis in 0.6\% and
   Echinococcus granulosus in 5.6\% of the samples. According to these
   results, Canis lupus italicus can be considered as involved in the wild

   sheep and goats) of taeniids in this area. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{The generic affiliation of the Andean species Caesalpinia trichocarpa,
   C. mimosifolia, and their close relatives has remained uncertain in all
   recent studies of Caesalpinia s.l. (Leguminosae, subfamily
   Caesalpinioideae). A new densely sampled phylogeny based on four DNA
   sequence regions (rps16, trnD-trnT, ycf6-psbM, ITS) strongly supports
   the monophyly of an Andean clade. We propose that despite the lack of
   obvious diagnostic morphological synapomorphies, this Andean group
   should be considered as a distinct genus, here described as the new
   genus Arquita. Phylogenetic analyses also suggest a problem with species
   delimitation in this group. Within C. trichocarpa, accessions from
   disjunct geographic areas in Argentina, Bolivia and Peru each form a
   robustly supported, unresolved clade that includes C. mimosifolia. The
   morphological and genetic cohesiveness of the C. trichocarpa complex is
   investigated using morphometric phenetic analyses of qualitative and
   quantitative flower and leaf traits, and reconstruction of a densely
   sampled phylogeny using three plastid and one nuclear ribosomal DNA
   sequence loci. Our results suggest that the most geographically isolated
   of these clades, narrowly endemic to two inter-Andean valleys in
   central-north Peru and separated by similar to 1350 km, and extensive
   high Andean cordilleras above 4000 m, from the nearest populations in
   Bolivia, represents a genetically highly distinct and morphologically
   cryptic lineage here described as a new species (Arquita grandiflora). A
   full taxonomic account of the new genus Arquita and its component
   species is provided, with a distribution map and a key to the species.}},

Abstract = {{Global warming is expected to change the thermal and hydrological soil
   regime in permafrost ecosystems which might impact soil erosion
   processes. Erosion assessment using radionuclides can provide
   information on past and ongoing, i.e. time-split, processes. The focus
   of this work was to find out if permafrost soils in the Swiss Alps
   differ in their medium- and long-term erosion rates from non-permafrost
   soils and if rates have accelerated during the last few decades.
   Using cosmogenic (meteoric Be-10) and anthropogenic radionuclides
   (Cs-137, Pu239 + 240), a time-split approach was achieved by determining
   erosion activities on the long (millennia; Be-10) and medium term
   (decades; Cs-137, Pu239 + 240). Additionally, the stable isotope delta
   C-13 signature in soil organic matter was used as a qualitative
   indicator for soil disturbance patterns. We compared soil erosion
   processes in permafrost soils and nearby unfrozen soils in the alpine
   (sites at 2,700 m asl, alpine tundra) and the subalpine (sites 1,800 m
   asl, natural forest) range of the Swiss Alps (Upper Engadine). Cs-137,
   Pu239 + 240 and delta C-13 measurements were performed at the alpine
   sites only.
   Depending on the calculation procedure (profile distribution model or
   inventory method), the Cs-137 measurements revealed soil accumulation
   rates of 1-3 t/km(2)/year in permafrost soils and 34-52 t/km(2)/year in
   non-permafrost soils. However, due to snow cover and subsequent
   melt-water runoff during Cs-137 deposition after the Chernobyl accident,
   caesium does not seem to be an appropriate soil erosion tracer on the
   investigated alpine sites. With Pu239 + 240, more reliable results were
   achieved. Pu239 + 240 measurements provided erosion rates of 31-186
   t/km(2)/year in permafrost soils and accumulation rates of 87-218
   t/km(2)/year in non-permafrost soils. Erosion and accumulation were
   relatively low and related to the vegetation community. The long-term
   (Be-10) soil redistribution rates (erosion rates up to 49 t/km(2)/year
   and accumulation rates up to 4 t/km(2)/year) were low with no
   significant differences between permafrost and non-permafrost sites. The
   delta C-13 signature indicated soil disturbances in permafrost and
   non-permafrost soils compared to the reference site.
   Our results highlight that soil redistribution rates have increased
   during the last few decades. However, whether the higher medium-term
   erosion rates obtained for the last decades are the result of the
   ongoing climate warming and related accelerated soil erosion or if other
   factors (e.g. measurement uncertainties) have been responsible for such
   an increase could not fully be clarified.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple approaches exist to model patterns of space use across species,
   among them resource selection analysis, statistical home-range modelling
   and mechanistic movement modelling. Mechanistic home-range models
   combine the benefits of these approaches, describing emergent
   territorial patterns based on fine-scale individual- or group-movement
   rules and incorporating interactions with neighbours and the
   environment. These models have not, to date, been extended to dynamic
   contexts. Using mechanistic home-range models, we explore meerkat
   (Suricata suricatta) territorial patterns, considering scent marking,
   direct group interactions and habitat selection. We also extend the
   models to accommodate dynamic aspects of meerkat territoriality
   (territory development and territory shift). We fit models, representing
   multiple working hypotheses, to data from a long-term meerkat study in
   South Africa, and we compare models using Akaike's and Bayesian
   Information Criteria. Our results identify important features of meerkat
   territorial patterns. Notably, larger groups do not seem to control
   larger territories, and groups apparently prefer dune edges along a dry
   river bed. Our model extensions capture instances in which 1) a newly
   formed group interacts more strongly with its parent groups over time
   and 2) a group moves its territory core out of aversive habitat. This
   extends our mechanistic modelling framework in previously unexplored
   directions.}},

Abstract = {{The current global wave of land acquisition variously debated as land
   grabbing or investment in land is promoted by the World Bank and the FAO
   as creating win win-situations for local populations and investors
   alike. Common policy recommendations suggest expanding the production of
   export crops, by making use of marginal or unused land. Considerable
   potentials for such an expansion are assumed. Taking Tanzania as a case
   study, the evidence for such types of land is assessed by using a broad
   range of statistics. We will argue firstly, that the terms marginal and
   unused land serve as a manipulative terminology for the benefit of
   attempts to commercially valorize and commodify African landscapes, from
   biofuel to large-scale food production and tourism. However, they relate
   to different rationalities of domination. Unused land refers to a
   state-bureaucratic narrative, which excludes user groups deemed
   irrelevant for national development, while marginal land refers to a
   capitalist-economic narrative that excludes what is not profitable.
   Secondly, the terms are analyzed as categories central for state
   simplification of social relations attached to land. Modelling of these
   land use categories based on remote sensing is an attempt to compensate
   weak state capacities to enhance the legibility of the landscape by
   constructing it as a landscape of commercial value. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The significance of chlamydiosis as a cause of mortality in wild
   passerines (Order Passeriformes), and the role of these birds as a
   potential source of zoonotic Chlamydia psittaci infection, is unknown.
   We reviewed wild bird mortality incidents (2005-2011). Where species
   composition or post-mortem findings were indicative of chlamydiosis, we
   examined archived tissues for C. psittaci infection using PCR and
   ArrayTube Microarray assays. Twenty-one of 40 birds tested positive: 8
   dunnocks (Prunella modularis), 7 great tits (Parus major), 3 blue tits
   (Cyanistes caeruleus), 2 collared doves (Streptopelia decaocto, Order
   Columbiformes), and 1 robin (Erithacus rubecula). Chlamydia psittaci
   genotype A was identified in all positive passerines and in a further
   three dunnocks and three robins diagnosed with chlamydiosis from a
   previous study. Two collared doves had genotype E. Ten of the 21 C.
   psittaci-positive birds identified in the current study had histological
   lesions consistent with chlamydiosis and co-localizing Chlamydia spp.
   antigens on immunohistochemistry. Our results indicate that chlamydiosis
   may be a more common disease of British passerines than was previously
   recognized. Wild passerines may be a source of C. psittaci zoonotic
   infection, and people should be advised to take appropriate hygiene
   precautions when handling bird feeders or wild birds.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{281}},
Number = {{1794}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{A hallmark of voluntary motor control is the ability to stop an ongoing
   movement. Is voluntary motor inhibition a general neural mechanism that
   can be focused on any movement, including involuntary movements, or is
   it mere termination of a positive voluntary motor command? The
   involuntary arm lift, or `floating arm trick', is a distinctive
   long-lasting reflex of the deltoid muscle. We investigated how a
   voluntary motor network inhibits this form of involuntary motor control.
   Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex during the
   floating arm trick produced a silent period in the reflexively
   contracting deltoid muscle, followed by a rebound of muscle activity.
   This pattern suggests a persistent generator of involuntary motor
   commands. Instructions to bring the arm down voluntarily reduced
   activity of deltoid muscle. When this voluntary effort was withdrawn,
   the involuntary arm lift resumed. Further, voluntary motor inhibition
   produced a strange illusion of physical resistance to bringing the arm
   down, as if ongoing involuntarily generated commands were located in a
   `sensory blind-spot', inaccessible to conscious perception. Our results
   suggest that voluntary motor inhibition may be a specific neural
   function, distinct from absence of positive voluntary motor commands.}},

Abstract = {{The species richness-productivity relationship (SRPR), by which the
   species richness of habitats or ecosystems is related to the
   productivity of the ecosystem or the taxon, has been documented both on
   regional and local scales, but its generality, biological meaning and
   underlying mechanisms remain debated. We evaluated the SRPR and three
   mechanistic hypotheses using terrestrial ferns in 18 study plots along
   an elevational gradient (500-4000m) in Ecuador. We measured annual
   increases in above-ground biomass of 6175 fern individuals from 91
   species over 2years, and estimated plot-level tree productivity from
   increases in above-ground woody biomass of 560 trees. Analyses were
   conducted by (i) comparing plots along the elevational gradient
   (regional scale) and (ii) comparing plots within each elevational belt
   (local scale). Fern diversity was related to the productivity of the
   fern assemblages, but not to above-ground productivity of the trees. At
   the regional scale, we found a positive relationship of fern species
   richness to fern productivity that appeared to be determined by an
   increase in the number of fern individuals and niche availability. In
   contrast, at the local scale, this relationship was negative and likely
   driven by interspecific competition.Synthesis. Plot diversity of ferns
   appears to be limited by the number of available niches and competition
   to occupy these niches. At the local scale, this is reflected in a
   negative SRPR probably driven by competition, whereas with increasing
   scale, the positive influence of productivity emerges. This represents
   the first evidence that productivity and competition affect the
   diversity of tropical herb assemblages at the plot scale.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Active smoking has been linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus
   (T2DM) but only few recent studies have shown environmental tobacco
   smoke (ETS) to be associated with DM in never-smokers. We assessed the
   association between long term ETS exposure and DM, and explored effect
   modifications of this association in our sample.
   Methods: We analysed 6392 participants of the Swiss study on air
   pollution and lung and heart diseases in adults (SAPALDIA). We used
   mixed logistic regression models to assess the cross-sectional
   association between ETS and DM. Selected variables were tested for
   effect modification and several sensitivity analyses were performed,
   mostly treating participants' study area as a random effect.
   Results: The prevalence of DM and ETS in the sample was 5.5\% and 47\%
   respectively. There were 2779 never-smokers with 4\% diabetes
   prevalence. Exposure to ETS increased risk of DM in never-smokers by
   50\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 2.26], and we observed a
   positive dose-response relationship between ETS exposure level and DM in
   never-smokers. Associations were strengthened (more than three-folds) by
   older age and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and were stronger
   in post-menopausal, obese, hypertriglyceridaemic and physically inactive
   participants. Estimates of association were robust across all
   sensitivity analyses (including inverse probability weighting for
   participation bias and fixed-effect analysis for study area). ETS had no
   substantial associations in current and ex-smokers in our study.
   Conclusions: We found a positive association between ETS exposure and DM
   in never smokers. Additional longitudinal studies involving biomarkers
   are needed to further explore underlying mechanisms and
   susceptibilities.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing evolution of polyandry, and consequent extra-pair reproduction
   in socially monogamous systems, is hypothesized to be facilitated by
   indirect selection stemming from cross-sex genetic covariances with
   components of male fitness. Specifically, polyandry is hypothesized to
   create positive genetic covariance with male paternity success due to
   inevitable assortative reproduction, driving ongoing coevolution.
   However, it remains unclear whether such covariances could or do emerge
   within complex polyandrous systems. First, we illustrate that genetic
   covariances between female extra-pair reproduction and male within-pair
   paternity success might be constrained in socially monogamous systems
   where female and male additive genetic effects can have opposing impacts
   on the paternity of jointly reared offspring. Second, we demonstrate
   nonzero additive genetic variance in female liability for extra-pair
   reproduction and male liability for within-pair paternity success,
   modeled as direct and associative genetic effects on offspring
   paternity, respectively, in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza
   melodia). The posterior mean additive genetic covariance between these
   liabilities was slightly positive, but the credible interval was wide
   and overlapped zero. Therefore, although substantial total additive
   genetic variance exists, the hypothesis that ongoing evolution of female
   extra-pair reproduction is facilitated by genetic covariance with male
   within-pair paternity success cannot yet be definitively supported or
   rejected either conceptually or empirically.}},

Abstract = {{Assortative mating, an ubiquitous form of nonrandom mating, strongly
   impacts Darwinian fitness and can drive biological diversification.
   Despite its ecological and evolutionary importance, the behavioural
   processes underlying assortative mating are often unknown, and in
   particular, mechanisms not involving mate choice have been largely
   ignored so far. Here, we propose that assortative mating can arise from
   prudent habitat choice', a general mechanism that acts under natural
   selection, and that it can occur despite a complete mixing of
   phenotypes. We show that in the cichlid Eretmodus cyanostictus
   size-assortative mating ensues, because individuals of weaker
   competitive ability ignore high-quality but strongly competed habitat
   patches. Previous studies showed that in E.cyanostictus, size-based mate
   preferences are absent. By field and laboratory experiments, here we
   showed that (i) habitat quality and body size are correlated in this
   species; (ii) territories with more stone cover are preferred by both
   sexes in the absence of competition; and (iii) smaller fish prudently
   occupy vacant territories of worse quality than do larger fish. Prudent
   habitat choice is likely to be a widespread mechanism of assortative
   mating, as both preferences for and dominance-based access to
   high-quality habitats are generic phenomena in animals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes potential criteria to allocate international funding
   for adaptation to climate change, as a response to one of the main
   governance challenges of international adaptation funding-the
   prioritization of project proposals given scarce funding. Based on the
   review of the equity and cost-effectiveness literature and relevant
   policy documents, we identify three potential indicators for equity
   (vulnerability level, poverty, equal funding per capita), and three
   indicators for cost-effectiveness (economic savings in absolute and
   relative terms, human lives saved). Applying these simple indicators to
   information provided in all 39 project documents considered by the
   Adaptation Fund Board (AFB) in 2011, we find that projects approved or
   endorsed by the AFB rank high according to one cost-effectiveness
   indicator (absolute economic savings), while they rather rank low
   according to all equity and further cost-effectiveness indicators.
   Furthermore, we analyze whether equity and cost-effectiveness are two
   contradicting goals, or whether ways can be found to reconcile both
   goals in multilateral adaptation finance. We conclude from both the
   theory and the 39 analyzed project documents that a pure economic
   definition of cost-effectiveness tends to be in contradiction with
   equity but that trade-offs between equity and cost-effectiveness can be
   limited if relative economic savings or human live savings are used as
   indicator for cost-effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{In mammalian herbivores, faecal particle size indicates chewing
   efficiency. Proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) are foregut fermenters
   in which regurgitation and remastication (i.e. rumination) was observed
   in the wild, but not with the same consistency as found in ruminants and
   camelids. To test whether this species has exceptional chewing
   efficiency among primates, as ruminants have among mammals, we compared
   faecal particle size in free-ranging specimens with those of 12 other
   primate species. The discrete mean faecal particle size (dMEAN)
   increased with body mass (M) as dMEAN (mm) = 0.65 (95 \% confidence
   interval 0.49-0.87) M (0.33 (0.23-0.43)) in simple-stomached species. At
   0.53 +/- A 0.09 mm, dMEAN of proboscis monkeys was particularly small
   for their average M (15 kg) and significantly smaller than values of two
   other foregut fermenting primate species. While we cannot exclude other
   reasons for the exceptional chewing efficiency in proboscis monkeys,
   this represents circumstantial evidence for regular use of rumination in
   this species. Thus, proboscis monkeys might be a model for convergent
   evolution towards rumination in a non-ungulate taxon.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{405-410}},

Abstract = {{Genotyping non-invasively collected samples is challenging.
   Nevertheless, genetic monitoring of elusive species like the European
   wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) mainly relies on such samples.
   Wildcats are likely threatened through introgression with domestic cats
   (F. silvestris catus). To determine introgression based on single cat
   hairs, we developed a 96.96 Fluidigm single nucleotide polymorphism
   (SNP) genotyping array chip. To estimate the accuracy of this method, we
   compared genotypes of 17 cats called with both Sanger sequencing and
   Fluidigm. When Sanger sequencing genotypes were considered as a
   reference, the genotyping error rate with Fluidigm was 0.9 \%. We
   subsequently compared 16 hair samples to tissue samples of the same
   individual. When the tissue samples were used as a reference, the
   genotyping error rate in hair samples was 1.6 \%. This low error rate
   allowed reliable recognition of individuals and correct assessment of
   introgression levels. Thus, the genotyping method presented in this
   paper is suitable for non-invasively collected samples. It will help
   conservationists to monitor the introgression rate in wildcat
   populations based on non-invasive hair sampling and subsequently to
   conduct effective conservation measures.}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Females often prefer to mate with high quality males, and one aspect of
   quality is physical performance. Although a preference for physically
   fitter males is therefore predicted, the relationship between
   attractiveness and performance has rarely been quantified. Here, I test
   for such a relationship in humans and ask whether variation in
   (endurance) performance is associated with variation in facial
   attractiveness within elite professional cyclists that finished the 2012
   Tour de France. I show that riders that performed better were more
   attractive, and that this preference was strongest in women not using a
   hormonal contraceptive. Thereby, I show that, within this pre-selected
   but relatively homogeneous sample of the male population, facial
   attractiveness signals endurance performance. Provided that there is a
   relationship between performance-mediated attractiveness and
   reproductive success, this suggests that human endurance capacity has
   been subject to sexual selection in our evolutionary past.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{639-650}},
Abstract = {{Mountain glaciers sample a combination of climate fields - temperature,
   precipitation and radiation - by accumulation and melting of ice. Flow
   dynamics acts as a transfer function that maps volume changes to a
   length response of the glacier terminus. Long histories of terminus
   positions have been assembled for several glaciers in the Alps. Here I
   analyze terminus position histories from an ensemble of seven glaciers
   in the Alps with a macroscopic model of glacier dynamics to derive a
   history of glacier equilibrium line altitude (ELA) for the time span
   400-2010 C. E. The resulting climatic reconstruction depends only on
   records of glacier variations. The reconstructed ELA history is similar
   to recent reconstructions of Alpine summer temperature and Atlantic
   Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index, but bears little resemblance to
   reconstructed precipitation variations. Most reconstructed low-ELA
   periods coincide with large explosive volcano eruptions, hinting at a
   direct effect of volcanic radiative cooling on mass balance. The glacier
   advances during the LIA, and the retreat after 1860, can thus be mainly
   attributed to temperature and volcanic radiative cooling.}},

Abstract = {{Density fractionation along with ultrasonic dispersion is widely applied
   in soil science to obtain distinct fractions of soil organic matter.
   Density cut-off and dispersion energy are crucial parameters to yield
   fractions closely corresponding to their conceptual definitions. Our
   literature review revealed methodological discrepancies in the
   utilization of density-fractionation schemes. Strikingly, reasons for
   the selection of specific density or dispersion energy were rarely
   explained. Thus, it is not known how results of different approaches
   relate to each other. We therefore recommend testing and reporting
   effects of fractionation parameters on chemical and physical properties
   of fractions, to achieve agreement and coherence on parameters to be
   used and facilitate comparability in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing debate over the effects of global environmental change on
   Earth's cryosphere calls for detailed knowledge about process rates and
   their variability in cold environments. In this context, appraisals of
   the coupling between glacier dynamics and para-glacial erosion rates in
   tectonically active mountains remain rare. We contribute to filling this
   knowledge gap and present an unprecedented regional-scale inventory of
   supra-glacial sediment flux and hillslope erosion rates inferred from an
   analysis of 123 large (> 0 center dot 1km2) catastrophic bedrock
   landslides that fell onto glaciers in the Chugach Mountains, Alaska, as
   documented by satellite images obtained between 1972 to 2008. Assuming
   these supra-glacial landslide deposits to be passive strain markers we
   infer minimum decadal-scale sediment yields of 190 to 7400tkm-2yr-1 for
   a given glacier-surface cross-section impacted by episodic rock-slope
   failure. These rates compare to reported fluvial sediment yields in many
   mountain rivers, but are an order of magnitude below the extreme
   sediment yields measured at the snouts of Alaskan glaciers, indicating
   that the bulk of debris discharged derives from en-glacial, sub-glacial
   or ice-proximal sources. We estimate an average minimum para-glacial
   erosion rate by large, episodic rock-slope failures at 0 center dot 5-0
   center dot 7mmyr-1 in the Chugach Mountains over a 50-yr period, with
   earthquakes likely being responsible for up to 73\% of this rate. Though
   ranking amongst the highest decadal landslide erosion rates for this
   size of study area worldwide, our inferred rates of hillslope erosion in
   the Chugach Mountains remain an order of magnitude below the pace of
   extremely rapid glacial sediment export and glacio-isostatic surface
   uplift previously reported from the region. Copyright (c) 2012 John

Abstract = {{Although tropical forests are renowned for their high plant diversity,
   to date there has been no global quantitative evaluation of the local
   species richness of terrestrial forest herbs in tropical forests. In
   this paper, richness and composition of terrestrial herb assemblages is
   compared in tropical forests of America, Africa and South East Asia. We
   established 86 non-continuous transects of 445 m each. Herb species
   richness was analysed and compared to six environmental parameters using
   minimal adequate regression models and simultaneous autoregressive
   models. At the global scale, we found a close relationship between herb
   species richness and temperature parameters, with no differences between
   continents. The subdivision into three main taxonomic groups (ferns,
   monocots, dicots) showed that each group has distinct relations to
   environmental factors and differences in richness between continents.
   Most of the 72 families found have pantropical distributions but 12, 11,
   and 16 families were significantly over-represented in America, Africa,
   and Asia, respectively. Although total species richness was closely
   related to climatic factors, ferns, monocots and dicots were represented
   by distinct sets of families with varying species richness on each
   continent. Which species are found at a given site may thus reflect
   group-specific evolutionary and historical factors.}},

Journal = {{CLIMATE POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{191-209}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project developers have long
   complained about the complexities of project-specific baseline setting
   and the vagaries of additionality determination. In response to this,
   the CDM Executive Board took bold steps towards the standardization of
   CDM methodologies, culminating in the approval of guidelines for the
   establishment of performance standards in November 2011. The guidelines
   specify a performance standard stringency level for both baseline and
   additionality of 80\% for several priority sectors and 90\% for all
   other sectors. However, an analysis of 14 large-scale CDM methodologies
   that use performance standard approaches challenges this top-down
   approach to the performance standard design. An appropriate performance
   standard stringency level strongly depends on sector and technology
   characteristics. A single stringency level for baseline and
   additionality determination is appropriate only for greenfield projects,
   but not for retrofit ones. Overly simple, highly aggregated performance
   standards are unlikely to ensure high environmental integrity, and
   difficult questions regarding stringency and updating frequency will
   eventually have to be addressed on a rather disaggregated level. A
   careful balance between data requirements and the practicability of
   performance standards is essential because the heavy data requirements
   of the existing performance standard methodologies have been the key
   barrier to their actual implementation. Policy relevance CDM regulators
   have been pushed by many stakeholders to standardize baseline setting
   and eliminate project-specific additionality determination. At first
   glance, performance standards seem to provide the perfect solution for
   both tasks. However, a one-size-fits-all political decision e.g. the
   average of the top 20\% performers as enshrined in the Marrakech Accords
   is inappropriate. Substantial disaggregation of performance standards is
   required both technologically and geographically in order to limit over-
   and under-crediting and close loopholes for non-additional projects. As
   a lack of reliable and complete data has been and will be a key
   bottleneck for the development of performance standards, international
   support for data collection will be indispensable, but costly, and
   time-consuming. Empirically driven, techno-economic assessments of
   performance standard stringency levels must be the central task of the
   future work on standardized methodologies, and should not be sidelined
   by perceived needs of policy makers to take bold decisions under time
   pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: What are the minimum methodological and
   conceptual requirements for an ethnopharmacological field study? How can
   the results of ethnopharmacological field studies be reported so that
   researchers with different backgrounds can draw on the results and
   develop new research questions and projects? And how should these field
   data be presented to get accepted in a scientific journal such as the
   Journal of Ethnopharmacology? The objective of this commentary is to
   create a reference that covers the basic standards necessary during
   planning, conducting and reporting of field research.
   Materials and methods: We focus on conducting and reporting
   ethnopharmacological field studies on medicinal plants or materia medico
   and associated knowledge of a specific people or region. The article
   highlights the most frequent problems and pitfalls, and draws on
   published literature, fieldwork experience, and extensive insights from
   peer-review of field studies.
   Results: Research needs to be ethical and legal, and follow local and
   national regulations. Primary ethnopharmacological field data need to be
   collected and presented in a transparent and comprehensible way. In
   short this includes: 1) Relevant and concise research questions, 2)
   Thorough literature study encompassing all available information on the
   study site from different disciplines, 3) Appropriate methods to answer
   the research questions, 4) Proper plant use documentation, unambiguously
   linked to voucher specimens, and 5) Qualitative and quantitative
   analyses of the collected data, the latter relying on use-reports as
   basic units.
   Conclusion: Although not exhaustive, we provide an overview of the
   necessary main issues to consider for field research and data reporting
   including a list of minimal standards and recommendations for best
   practices. For methodological details and how to correctly apply
   specific methods, we refer to further reading of suggested textbooks and
   methods manuals.}},

Title = {{The role of dispersal in river network metacommunities: Patterns,

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{63}},

Pages = {{141-163}},

Abstract = {{1. River networks are hierarchical dendritic habitats embedded within
   the terrestrial landscape, with varying connectivity between sites
   depending on their positions along the network. This physical
   organisation influences the dispersal of organisms, which ultimately
   affects metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity patterns.
   2. We provide a conceptual synthesis of the role of river networks in
   structuring metacommunities in relation to dispersal processes in
   riverine ecosystems. We explore where the river network best explains
   observed metacommunity structure compared to other measurements of
   physical connectivity. We mostly focus on invertebrates, but also
   consider other taxonomic groups, including microbes, fishes, plants, and
   amphibians.
   3. Synthesising studies that compared multiple spatial distance metrics,
   we found that the importance of the river network itself in explaining
   metacommunity patterns depended on a variety of factors, including
   dispersal mode (aquatic versus aerial versus terrestrial) and landscape
   type (arid versus mesic), as well as location- specific factors, such as
   network connectivity, land use, topographic heterogeneity, and biotic
   interactions. The river network appears to be less important for strong
   aerial dispersers and insects in arid systems than for other groups and
   biomes, but there is considerable variability. Borrowing from other
   literature, particularly landscape genetics, we developed a conceptual
   model that predicts that the explanatory power of the river network
   peaks in mesic systems for obligate aquatic dispersers.
   4. We propose directions of future avenues of research, including the
   use of manipulative field and laboratory experiments that test
   metacommunity theory in river networks. While field and laboratory
   experiments have their own benefits and drawbacks (e.g. reality,
   control, cost), both are powerful approaches for understanding the
   mechanisms structuring metacommunities, by teasing apart dispersal and
   niche-related factors.
   5. Finally, improving our knowledge of dispersal in river networks will
   benefit from expanding the breadth of cost-distance modelling to better
   infer dispersal from observational data; an improved understanding of
   life-history strategies rather than relying on independent traits;
   exploring individual-level variation in dispersal through detailed
   genetic studies; detailed studies on fine-scale environmental (e.g.
   daily hydrology) and organismal spatiotemporal variability; and
   synthesising comparative, experimental, and theoretical work. Expanding
   in these areas will help to push the current state of the science from a
   largely pattern-detection mode into a new phase of more mechanistically
   driven research.}},

Abstract = {{Stomatal pores are formed between a pair of guard cells and allow plant
   uptake of CO2 and water evaporation. Their aperture depends on changes
   in osmolyte concentration of guard cell vacuoles, specifically of K+ and
   Mal(2-). Efflux of Mai(2-)from the vacuole is required for stomatal
   closure; however, it is not clear how the anion is released. Here, we
   report the identification of ALMT4 (ALUMINUM ACTIVATED MALATE
   TRANSPORTER4) as an Arabidopsis thaliana ion channel that can mediate
   Mal(2-) release from the vacuole and is required for stomatal closure in
   response to abscisic acid (ABA). Knockout mutants showed impaired
   stomatal closure in response to the drought stress hormone ABA and
   increased whole-plant wilting in response to drought and ABA.
   Electrophysiological data show that ALMT4 can mediate Mal(2-) efflux and
   that the channel activity is dependent on a phosphorylatable C-terminal
   serine. Dephosphomimetic mutants of ALMT4 S382 showed increased channel
   activity and Mal(2-)efflux. Reconstituting the active channel in almt4
   mutants impaired growth and stomatal opening. Phosphomimetic mutants
   were electrically inactive and phenocopied the almt4 mutants.
   Surprisingly, S382 can be phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein
   kinases in vitro. In brief, ALMT4 likely mediates Mal(2-)efflux during
   ABA-induced stomatal closure and its activity depends on
   phosphorylation.}},

Abstract = {{While glacier volumes in most cold mountain ranges rapidly decrease due
   to continued global warming, degradation of permafrost at altitudes
   above and below glaciers is much slower. As a consequence, many still
   existing glacier and permafrost landscapes probably transform within
   decades into new landscapes of bare bedrock, loose debris, sparse
   vegetation, numerous new lakes and steep slopes with slowly degrading
   permafrost. These new landscapes are likely to persist for centuries if
   not millennia to come.
   During variable but mostly extended future time periods, such new
   landscapes will be characterized by pronounced disequilibria within
   their geo- and ecosystems. This especially involves long-term stability
   reduction of steep/icy mountain slopes as a slow and delayed reaction to
   stress redistribution following de-buttressing by vanishing glaciers and
   to changes in mechanical strength and hydraulic permeability caused by
   permafrost degradation. Thereby, the probability of far-reaching flood
   waves from large mass movements into lakes systematically increases with
   the formation of many new lakes and systems of lakes in dose
   neighborhood to. or even directly at the foot of, so-affected slopes.
   Results of recent studies in the Swiss Alps are reviewed and
   complemented with examples from the Cordillera Blanca in Peru and the
   Mount Everest region in Nepal.
   Hot spots of future hazards from potential flood waves caused by large
   rock falls into new lakes can already now be recognized. To this end,
   integrated spatial information on glacier/permafrost evolution and lake
   formation can be used together with scenario-based models for rapid mass
   movements, impact waves and flood propagation. The resulting information
   must then be combined with exposure and vulnerability considerations
   related to settlements and infrastructure. This enables timely planning
   of risk reduction options. Such risk reduction options consist of two
   components: Mitigation of hazards, which in the present context are due
   to effects from climate change, and reduction in consequences, which
   result from societal conditions and changes. Hazard mitigation may
   include artificial lake drainage or lake-level lowering and flood
   retention, optimally in connection with multipurpose structures for
   hydropower production and/or irrigation. Reduction in damage potential
   (exposure, vulnerability) can be accomplished by installing
   early-warning systems, adapting spatial planning and/or by improving
   preparedness of local people and institutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The self-incompatible species Arabidopsis halleri is a close relative of
   the self-compatible model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The broad European
   and Asian distribution and heavy metal hyperaccumulation ability make A.
   halleri a useful model for ecological genomics studies. We used
   long-insert mate-pair libraries to improve the genome assembly of the A.
   halleri ssp. gemmifera Tada mine genotype (W302) collected from a site
   with high contamination by heavy metals in Japan. After five rounds of
   forced selfing, heterozygosity was reduced to 0.04\%, which facilitated
   subsequent genome assembly. Our assembly now covers 196 Mb or 78\% of
   the estimated genome size and achieved scaffold N50 length of 712 kb. To
   validate assembly and annotation, we used synteny of A. halleri Tada
   mine with a previously published high-quality reference assembly of a
   closely related species, Arabidopsis lyrata. Further validation of the
   assembly quality comes from synteny and phylogenetic analysis of the
   HEAVY METAL ATPASE4 (HMA4) and METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN1 (MTP1) regions
   using published sequences from European A. halleri for comparison. Three
   tandemly duplicated copies of HMA4, key gene involved in cadmium and
   zinc hyperaccumulation, were assembled on a single scaffold. The
   assembly will enhance the genomewide studies of A. halleri as well as
   the allopolyploid Arabidopsis kamchatica derived from A. lyrata and A.
   halleri.}},

Title = {{Pedigree-based inbreeding coefficient explains more variation in fitness
   than heterozygosity at 160 microsatellites in a wild bird population}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{284}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Although the pedigree-based inbreeding coefficient F predicts the
   expected proportion of an individual's genome that is
   identical-by-descent (IBD), heterozygosity at genetic markers captures
   Mendelian sampling variation and thereby provides an estimate of
   realized IBD. Realized IBD should hence explain more variation in
   fitness than their pedigree-based expectations, but how many markers are
   required to achieve this in practice remains poorly understood. We use
   extensive pedigree and life-history data from an island population of
   song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to show that the number of genetic
   markers and pedigree depth affected the explanatory power of
   heterozygosity and F, respectively, but that heterozygosity measured at
   160 microsatellites did not explain more variation in fitness than F.
   This is in contrast with other studies that found heterozygosity based
   on far fewer markers to explain more variation in fitness than F. Thus,
   the relative performance of marker-and pedigree-based estimates of IBD
   depends on the quality of the pedigree, the number, variability and
   location of the markers employed, and the species-specific recombination
   landscape, and expectations based on detailed and deep pedigrees remain
   valuable until we can routinely afford genotyping hundreds of phenotyped
   wild individuals of genetic non-model species for thousands of genetic
   markers.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use change due to the widespread practice of swidden agriculture
   affects the supply of ecosystem services. However, there is
   comparatively little understanding of how the hydrological functioning
   of soils, which affects rainfall infiltration and therefore flood risk,
   dry-season flows and surface erosion, is affected by repeated vegetation
   clearing and burning, the extent to which this can recover following
   land abandonment and vegetation regrowth, and whether active restoration
   speeds up recovery. We used interviews with local land users and
   indicator plant species to reconstruct the land-use history of 19
   different sites in upland eastern Madagascar that represent four
   different land-use categories: semi mature forests that were never burnt
   but were influenced by manual logging until 15-20 years ago; fallows
   that were actively reforested 6-9 years ago; 2-10 year old naturally
   regenerating fallows; and highly degraded fire-climax grassland sites.
   Surface- and hear-surface (down to 30 cm depth) saturated soil hydraulic
   conductivities (K-sat), as Well as the dominant flow pathways for
   infiltration and percolation were determined for each land-cover type.
   Surface K-sat in the forest sites was very high (median: 724 mm h(-1))
   and infiltration was dominated by flow along roots and other
   preferential flow pathways (macropores), whereas K-sat in the degraded
   land was low (median: 45 mm h(-1)) with infiltration being dominated by
   near-surface matrix flow. The total area of blue-dye stains was
   inversely correlated to the K-sat,. Both surface- and near-surface K-sat
   had increased significantly after 6-9 years of forest regeneration
   (median values of 203 and 161 mm h(-1) for reforestation and natural
   regeneration, respectively). Additional observations are needed to more
   fully understand the rates at which soil hydrological functioning can be
   rebuilt and whether active replanting decreases the time required to
   restore soil hydrological functioning or not. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

   task), and oxygen consumption, (3) methods based on heart rate or (4)
   breathing rate, and (5) methods that combine heart and breathing rate.
   Methods were compared using a real-life data set of 122 adults who wore
   devices to track movement, black carbon air pollution, and physiological
   health markers for 3 weeks in three European cities. Different methods
   for estimating minute ventilation performed well in relative terms with
   high correlations among different methods, but in absolute terms,
   ignoring increased ventilation during day-to-day activities could lead
   to an underestimation of the daily dose by a factor of 0.08-1.78. There
   is no single best method, and a multitude of methods are currently being
   used to approximate the dose. The choice of a suitable method for
   determining the dose in future studies will depend on both the size and
   the objectives of the study.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To quantify the seasonal differences in effects of leaf habit,
   species identity, initial diameter, neighborhood interaction and stand
   environment on tree absolute diameter growth rates in a subtropical
   forest in China.
   Methods We used man-made dendrometer bands to record radial increments
   of all trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm and height >=
   3 m within 25 comparative study plots (30 x 30 m for each) of the
   `Biodiversity- Ecosystem Functioning Experiment China' (BEF-China) in
   the Gutianshan National Nature Reserve, Zhejiang Province, China. We
   measured stem circumferences twice a year from 2011 to 2014 to calculate
   absolute diameter growth rate of a warm and wet season (WWS, April to
   September) and a dry and cold season (DCS, October to the next March)
   for each individual tree: annual growth (GR(year)), growth during the
   WWS (GR(WWS)) and growth during the DCS (GR(DCS)). We firstly tested the
   differences in growth rates between different seasons using paired
   t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Then we applied linear mixed models
   to explore the effects of leaf habit, species identity, initial
   diameter, neighborhood interaction (indicated by richness, density and
   total basal area of all neighboring trees within a radius of 5 m around
   target trees), stand age and topography (elevation, slope and aspect) on
   tree growth rates of the two different seasons in three deciduous and 14
   evergreen species.
   Important Findings GR(year), GR(WWS) and GR(DCS) varied between
   0.04-0.50 cm year(-1) (mean = 0.21), 0.03 0.46cm season-(1) (mean =
   0.18) and 0.01 0.05 cm season(-1) (mean = 0.03) across the 17 species,
   respectively. GR(WWS) was significantly higher than GR(DCS) for all
   species. Growth rates of faster growing species tended to have larger
   absolute differences between the WWS and DCS. Tree growth rates of both
   seasons and of the year (GR(year), GR(WWS) and GR(DCS)) varied
   significantly among leaf habit and species, and increased allometrically
   with initial diameter, decreased with stand age, but were not
   significantly related to topography and neighborhood richness or
   density. GRWWS decreased with neighborhood total basal area, while GRDCS
   did not. In conclusion, species might the temporally complementary,
   contributing to plot growth at different times of the year.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the first reanalysis of a long-term glacier
   mass-balance record in the Canadian Arctic. The reanalysis is
   accomplished through comparison of the 1960-2014 glaciological
   mass-balance record of White Glacier, Axel Heiberg Island, Nunavut, with
   a geodetically derived mass change over the same period. The corrections
   applied to homogenize the two datasets, including adjusting for changes
   in hypsometry over the period of record and the generic differences
   between methods, are discussed along with the associated systematic and
   random errors of the two forms of mass-balance measurement. Statistical
   comparison of the two datasets reveals that within the error margin
   there is no significant difference between the average annual
   glaciological balance (-213 +/- 28 mm w.e. a(-1)) and geodetic balance
   (-178 +/- 16 mm w.e. a(-1)) at White Glacier over the 54 year record.
   The validity of this result, and the assumptions made in implementing
   the glaciological method, are critically assessed.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{575}},
Pages = {{1041-1055}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Due to their sensitivity to changing environmental conditions sub-and
   alpine soils are often monitored in the context of climate change,
   usually, however, neglecting slope exposure. Therefore, we set up a
   climosequence-approach to study the effect of exposure and, in general,
   climate, on the microbial biomass and microbial diversity and activity,
   comprising five pairs of north (N)- and south (S)-facing sites along an
   altitudinal gradient ranging from 1200 to 2400 m a.s.l. in the Italian
   Alps (Trentino Alto Adige, Italy). Soil physico-chemical properties were
   related to microbiological properties (microbial biomass: double strand
   DNA yield vs. substrate-induced respiration; diversity of bacterial,
   fungal and archaeal communities: genetic fingerprinting DGGE vs.
   real-time PCR; microbial activity: basal respiration vs. multiple
   hydrolytic enzyme assays) to monitor shifts in the diversity and
   activity of microbial communities as a function of slope exposure and to
   evaluate the most determinant chemical parameters shaping the soil
   microbiota. The exposure-effect on several hydrolytic key-enzymes was
   enzyme-specific: e.g. acid phosphomonoesterase potential activity was
   more pronounced at the N-facing slope while the activities of alkaline
   phosphomonoesterase, pyrophosphate-phosphodiesterase and arylsulfatase
   were higher at the S-facing slope. Furthermore, this exposure-effect was
   domain-specific: bacteria (S > N, altitude-independent); fungi (N
   similar to S); and archaea (N > S; altitude-dependent). Additionally,
   the abiotic parameters shaping the community composition were in general
   depending on soil depth. Our multidisciplinary approach allowed us to
   survey the exposure and altitudinal effects on soil physico-chemical and
   microbiological properties and thus unravel the complex multiple edaphic
   factor-effects on soil microbiota in mountain ecosystems. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The accumulation of starch within photosynthetic tissues and within
   dedicated storage organs has been characterized extensively in many
   species, and a function in buffering carbon availability or in fueling
   later growth phases, respectively, has been proposed. However,
   developmentally regulated starch turnover within heterotrophic tissues
   other than dedicated storage organs is poorly characterized, and its
   function is not well understood. Here, we report on the characterization
   of starch turnover during flower, early embryo, and silique development
   in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) using a combined clearing-staining
   technique on whole-mount tissue. Besides the two previously documented
   waves of transient starch accumulation in the stamen envelope, occurring
   during meiosis and pollen mitosis I, we identified a novel, third wave
   of starch amylogenesis/amylolysis during the last stages of stamen
   development. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms,
   we analyzed publicly available microarray data, which revealed a
   developmentally coordinated expression of carbohydrate transport and
   metabolism genes during these waves of transient starch accumulation.
   Based on this analysis, we characterized starch dynamics in mutants
   affecting hexose phosphate metabolism and translocation, and identified
   the Glc-6-phosphate/phosphate antiporter GPT1 as the putative
   translocator of Glc-6-phosphate for starch biosynthesis in reproductive
   tissues. Based on these results, we propose a model of starch synthesis
   within the pollen grain and discuss the nutrient transport route feeding
   the embryo within the developing seed.}},

Journal = {{ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have become an interesting and active
   research topic for photogrammetry. Current research is based on images
   acquired by an UAV, which have a high ground resolution and good
   spectral and radiometrical resolution, due to the low flight altitudes
   combined with a high resolution camera. UAV image flights are also cost
   effective and have become attractive for many applications including,
   change detection in small scale areas.
   One of the main problems preventing full automation of data processing
   of UAV imagery is the degradation effect of blur caused by camera
   movement during image acquisition. This can be caused by the normal
   flight movement of the UAV as well as strong winds, turbulence or sudden
   operator inputs. This blur disturbs the visual analysis and
   interpretation of the data, causes errors and can degrade the accuracy
   in automatic photogrammetric processing algorithms. The detection and
   removal of these images is currently achieved manually, which is both
   time consuming and prone to error, particularly for large image-sets. To
   increase the quality of data processing an automated process is
   necessary, which must be both reliable and quick.
   This paper describes the development of an automatic filtering process,
   which is based upon the quantification of blur in an image. Images with
   known blur are processed digitally to determine a quantifiable measure
   of image blur. The algorithm is required to process UAV images fast and
   reliably to relieve the operator from detecting blurred images manually.
   The newly developed method makes it possible to detect blur caused by
   linear camera displacement and is based on human detection of blur.
   Humans detect blurred images best by comparing it to other images in
   order to establish whether an image is blurred or not. The developed
   algorithm simulates this procedure by creating an image for comparison
   using image processing. Creating internally a comparable image makes the
   method independent of additional images. However, the calculated blur
   value named SIEDS (saturation image edge difference standard-deviation)
   on its own does not provide an absolute number to judge if an image is
   blurred or not. To achieve a reliable judgement of image sharpness the
   SIEDS value has to be compared to other SIEDS values from the same
   dataset.
   The speed and reliability of the method was tested using a range of
   different UAV datasets. Two data sets will be presented in this paper to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The algorithm proves to
   be fast and the returned values are optically correct, making the
   algorithm applicable for UAV datasets. Additionally, a close range
   dataset was processed to determine whether the method is also useful for
   close range applications. The results show that the method is also
   reliable for close range images, which significantly extends the field
   of application for the algorithm. (C) 2016 International Society for

Abstract = {{Overdeepenings, i.e. closed topographic depressions with adverse slopes
   in the direction of flow, are characteristic for glacier beds and
   glacially sculpted landscapes. Quantitative information about their
   morphological characteristics, however, has so far hardly been
   available. The present study provides such information by combining the
   analysis of (a) numerous bed overdeepenings below still existing
   glaciers of the Swiss Alps and the Himalaya-Karakoram region modelled
   with a robust shear stress approximation and (b) detailed bathymetries
   from recently exposed lakes in the Peruvian Andes. The investigated
   overdeepenings exist where glacier surface slopes are low (< 5
   degrees-10 degrees), occur in bedrock or morainic material and are most
   commonly a fraction of a kilometre squared in surface area, hundreds of
   metres long, about half the length in width and tens of metres deep.
   They form under conditions of low to high basal shear stresses, at
   cirque, confluence, trunk valley and terminus positions. The most
   striking phenomenon, however, is the high variability of their
   geometries: Depths, surface areas, lengths and widths of the
   overdeepenings vary over orders of magnitude and are only weakly - if at
   all - interrelated. Inclinations of adverse slopes do not differ
   significantly from those of forward slopes and are in many cases higher
   than so far assumed theoretical limits for supercooling of ascending
   water and corresponding closure of sub-glacial channels. Such steep
   adverse slopes are a robust observation and in support of recently
   developed new concepts concerning the question about where supercooling
   of sub-glacial water and closure of ice channels can or must occur.
   However, the question of when and under what climatic, topographic and
   ice conditions the overdeepenings had formed remains unanswered. This
   open question constitutes a key problem concerning the interpretation of
   observed overdeepenings, the understanding of the involved
   glacio-hydraulic processes and the possibility of realistic predictive
   modelling of overdeepening formation. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \&

Title = {{Tree taxa and pyrolysis temperature interact to control the efficacy of

Abstract = {{We know little about how shifts in tree species distribution and
   increases in forest fire intensity could affect the formation of
   pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) or charcoal, one of the most important
   and persistent soil organic matter pools. This limitation arises partly
   because the role of the precursor wood in controlling PyOM formation is
   unclear. The current study shows how tree species and pyrolysis
   temperature (200, 300, 450 and 600 A degrees C) interact to control the
   physicochemical structure of the PyOM experimentally derived from
   C-13/N-15-enriched Pinus banksania and Acer rubrum, two important
   co-occurring gymnosperm and angiosperm tree species from North American
   boreal-temperate ecotones. Complementary physicochemical and
   thermodynamic measurements revealed different susceptibilities of the
   two wood species to charring, with PyOM intermediates formed at lower
   temperature from the pine, indicating that the tree species regulated
   the efficacy of PyOM formation. Particularly, we report high-resolution
   data describing the comprehensive chemical architecture of PyOM (both -C
   and -N) as they are formed, which are complemented by unique
   molecular-level insights on their labile fractions. We posit that the
   tree species and pyrolysis temperature interaction reflects distinctive
   anatomical features of the two major tree taxa, including greater
   effective porosity in gymnosperms that promote the loss of volatiles and
   enhance the heat exposure of bio-components. This study points to a
   higher temperature threshold for PyOM production in maple forests
   compared with pine forests, resulting in potentially more degradable and
   less sorbtive PyOM in ecotones dominated by the former species.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the effects of biodiversity on community persistence and
   productivity is key to managing both natural and production systems.
   Because rare species face greater danger of extinction, species
   evenness, a measure of how similar abundances are across species in a
   community, is seen as a key component of biodiversity. However, previous
   studies have failed to find a consistent association of species evenness
   with species survival and biomass production. Here we provide a
   theoretical framework for the relationship among these three elements.
   We demonstrate that the lack of consistent outcomes is not an
   idiosyncratic artifact of different studies but can be unified under one
   common framework. Applying a niche theory approach, we confirm that
   under demographic stochasticity evenness is a general indicator of the
   risk of future species extinctions in a community, in accordance with
   the majority of empirical studies. In contrast, evenness cannot be used
   as a direct indicator of the level of biomass production in a community.
   When a single species dominates, as expressed by the constraints imposed
   by the population dynamics, biomass production depends on the niche
   position of the dominating species and can increase or decrease with
   evenness. We demonstrate that high species evenness and an intermediate
   level of biomass production is the configuration that maximizes the
   average species survival probability in response to demographic
   stochasticity.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of species and population boundaries is important in
   both evolutionary and conservation biology. In recent years, new
   population genetic and computational methods for estimating population
   parameters and testing hypotheses in a quantitative manner have emerged.
   Using a Bayesian framework and a quantitative model-testing approach, we
   evaluated the species status and genetic connectedness of bottlenose
   dolphin (Tursiops spp.) populations off remote northwestern Australia,
   with a focus on pelagic `offshore' dolphins subject to incidental
   capture in a trawl fishery. We analysed 71 dolphin samples from three
   sites beyond the 50 m depth contour (the inshore boundary of the
   fishery) and up to 170 km offshore, including incidentally caught and
   free-ranging individuals associating with trawl vessels, and 273
   dolphins sampled at 12 coastal sites inshore of the 50 m depth contour
   and within 10 km of the coast. Results from 19 nuclear microsatellite
   markers showed significant population structure between dolphins from
   within the fishery and coastal sites, but also among dolphins from
   coastal sites, identifying three coastal populations. Moreover, we found
   no current or historic gene flow into the offshore population in the
   region of the fishery, indicating a complete lack of recruitment from
   coastal sites. Mitochondrial DNA corroborated our findings of genetic
   isolation between dolphins from the offshore population and coastal
   sites. Most offshore individuals formed a monophyletic clade with common
   bottlenose dolphins (T. truncatus), while all 273 individuals sampled
   coastally formed a well-supported clade of Indo-Pacific bottlenose
   dolphins (T. aduncus). By including a quantitative modelling approach,
   our study explicitly took evolutionary processes into account for
   informing the conservation and management of protected species. As such,
   it may serve as a template for other, similarly inaccessible study
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) arises when the net effects of natural and
   sexual selection on body size differ between the sexes. Quantitative SSD
   variation between taxa is common, but directional intraspecific SSD
   reversals are rare. We combined micro- and macroevolutionary approaches
   to study geographic SSD variation in closely related black scavenger
   flies. Common garden experiments revealed stark intra- and interspecific
   variation: Sepsis biflexuosa is monomorphic across the Holarctic, while
   S. cynipsea (only in Europe) consistently exhibits female-biased SSD.
   Interestingly, S. neocynipsea displays contrasting SSD in Europe
   (females larger) and North America (males larger), a pattern opposite to
   the geographic reversal in SSD of S. punctum documented in a previous
   study. In accordance with the differential equilibrium model for the
   evolution of SSD, the intensity of sexual selection on male size varied
   between continents (weaker in Europe), whereas fecundity selection on
   female body size did not. Subsequent comparative analyses of 49 taxa
   documented at least six independent origins of male-biased SSD in
   Sepsidae, which is likely caused by sexual selection on male size and
   mediated by bimaturism. Therefore, reversals in SSD and the associated
   changes in larval development might be much more common and rapid and
   less constrained than currently assumed.}},

Title = {{Habitat requirements and ecological niche of two cryptic amphipod
   species at landscape and local scales}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Cryptic species are phylogenetically diverged taxa that are
   morphologically indistinguishable and may differ in their ecological and
   behavioral requirements. This may have important implications for
   ecosystem services and conservation of biodiversity. We investigated
   whether two ecologically important cryptic species of the freshwater
   amphipod Gammarus fossarum (types A and B) are associated with different
   habitats. We collected data on their occurrence at both the landscape
   scale (large watersheds) and at the local scale (river reach) to compare
   macro- and microscale environmental parameters associated with their
   presence. Analysis of the landscape scale data showed that occurrence of
   types A and B differ with respect to watershed and river size and,
   interestingly, human impact on river ecomorphology. Whereas type B was
   mainly found in less forested areas with higher human impact, type A
   showed the opposite occurrence pattern. Analyses of the local scale data
   suggested that habitats occupied by type A were characterized by larger
   gravel, larger stones and less macrophytes than habitats occupied by
   type B. The landscape and local data set showed contradicting patterns
   with regard to stream size. Overall, the observed differences between
   the two types of G. fossarum most likely reflect ecological differences
   between them, but alternative explanations (e. g., historical
   colonization processes) cannot be completely ruled out. Our study
   underlines that common cryptic species can differ in their ecology and
   response to anthropogenic influence. Such differences in habitat
   requirements among difficult-to-identify taxa present a challenge for
   biodiversity and ecosystem management. Our results emphasize the
   importance of conservative and precautionary approaches in maintenance
   of habitat diversity and environmental heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of the N-glycoproteome in integral membrane proteins of
   the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) or the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis
   thaliana and, for further comparison, of the Rattus norvegicus lysosomal
   and plasma membranes, was analyzed. In silico analysis showed that
   potential N-glycosylation sites are much less frequent in tonoplast
   proteins. Biochemical analysis of Arabidopsis subcellular fractions with
   the lectin concanavalin A, which recognizes mainly unmodified N-glycans,
   or with antiserum against Golgi-modified N-glycans confirmed the in
   silico results and showed that, unlike the plant plasma membrane, the
   tonoplast is almost or totally devoid of N-glycoproteins with
   Golgi-modified glycans. Lysosomes share with vacuoles the hydrolytic
   functions and the position along the secretory pathway; however, our
   results indicate that their membranes had a divergent evolution. We
   propose that protection against the luminal hydrolases that are abundant
   in inner hydrolytic compartments, which seems to have been achieved in
   many lysosomal membrane proteins by extensive N-glycosylation of the
   luminal domains, has instead been obtained in the vast majority of
   tonoplast proteins by limiting the length of such domains.}},

Title = {{Down-regulation of tomato PHYTOL KINASE strongly impairs tocopherol

   manner}},

Abstract = {{Tocopherol, a compound with vitamin E (VTE) activity, is a conserved
   constituent of the plastidial antioxidant network in photosynthetic
   organisms. The synthesis of tocopherol involves the condensation of an
   aromatic head group with an isoprenoid prenyl side chain. The latter,
   phytyl diphosphate, can be derived from chlorophyll phytol tail
   recycling, which depends on phytol kinase (VTE5) activity. How plants
   co-ordinate isoprenoid precursor distribution for supplying biosynthesis
   of tocopherol and other prenyllipids in different organs is poorly
   understood. Here, Solanum lycopersicum plants impaired in the expression
   of two VTE5-like genes identified by phylogenetic analyses, named SIVTE5
   and SIFOLK, were characterized. Our data show that while SIFOLK does not
   affect tocopherol content, the production of this metabolite is >80\%
   dependent on SIVTE5 in tomato, in both leaves and fruits. VTE5
   deficiency greatly impacted lipid metabolism, including prenylquinones,
   carotenoids, and fatty acid phytyl esters. However, the prenyllipid
   profile greatly differed between source and sink organs, revealing
   organ-specific metabolic adjustments in tomato. Additionally,
   VTE5-deficient plants displayed starch accumulation and lower CO2
   assimilation in leaves associated with mild yield penalty. Taken
   together, our results provide valuable insights into the distinct
   regulation of isoprenoid metabolism in leaves and fruits and also expose
   the interaction between lipid and carbon metabolism, which results in
   carbohydrate export blockage in the VTE5-deficient plants, affecting
   tomato fruit quality.}},

Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{A trial at semi-industrial scale was conducted to evaluate the effect of
   wood ash amendment on communal biowaste in a composting process and on
   the final composts produced. For this purpose, three treatments
   including an unamended control (CO) and composts with additions of 6\%
   (C6), and 12\% (C12) of wood ash (w/w) were studied, and
   physico-chemical parameters as well as microbial activity and community
   composition were investigated. At the end of the process, composts were
   tested for toxicity and quality, and microbial physiological activity.
   The influence of ash addition on compost temperature, pH, microbial
   activity and composition was stronger during the early composting stages
   and diminished with time, whereby composts became more similar. Using
   the COMPOCHIP microarray, a reduction in the pathogenic genera Listeria
   and Clostridium was observed, which together with the temperature
   increases of the composting process helped in the hygienisation of
   composts. Lactobacillus species were also affected, such that reduced
   hybridisation signals were observed with increased ash addition, due to
   the increased pH values in amended composts. Organic matter
   mineralisation was also increased through ash addition, and no negative
   effects on the composting process were observed. The nutrient content of
   the final products was increased through the addition of ash, and no
   toxic effects were observed. Nonetheless, greater concentrations of
   heavy metals were found in composts amended with more ash, which
   resulted in a downgrading of the compost quality according to the
   Austrian Compost Ordinance. Thus, regulation of both input materials and
   end-product quality is essential in optimising composting processes. (C)

Abstract = {{The importance of integrating local perspectives into international
   debates about climate change has received increasing attention. Local
   perspectives on the impacts of climate change often focus on issues of
   loss and harm and support the widely recognized need for global
   responses to climate change as suggested by scientists and international
   institutions. Here we argue that local perspectives need to be addressed
   not only from outside communities but also from inside in order to
   understand people's responses to climate change: their concerns, their
   understanding of themselves as members of particular groups and their
   position in the world, their view on responsibilities for causing
   climate change, and their perceptions of possible responses. The
   ethnographic work at two study sites, one in Carhuaz, Cordillera Blanca,
   Peru, and one in Stilfs, South Tyrolean Alps, Italy, identifies dominant
   perceptions on climate change at each site with a particular focus on
   glacier retreat. The case studies show that the view on the need for
   global action as response to climate change is not necessarily shared
   throughout the world, and thus presents a challenge to global
   collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{Although the protective role of leaf litter cover against soil erosion
   is known for a long time, little research has been conducted on the
   processes involved. Moreover, the impact of soil meso-and macrofauna
   within the litter layer on erosion control is not clear. To investigate
   how leaf litter cover and diversity as well as meso-and macrofauna
   influence sediment discharge in subtropical forest ecosystems, a field
   experiment has been carried out in Southeast China. A full-factorial
   random design with 96 micro-scale runoff plots and 7 domestic leaf
   species was established and erosion was triggered by a rainfall
   simulator. Our results demonstrate that leaf litter cover protects soil
   from erosion (-82\% sediment discharge on leaf covered plots) by
   rainfall and this protection is removed as litter decomposes. The
   protective effect is influenced by the presence or absence of soil
   meso-and macrofauna. Fauna presence increases soil erosion rates
   significantly by 58 \%, while leaf species diversity shows a
   non-significant negative trend. We assume that the faunal effect arises
   from arthropods slackening and processing the soil surface as well as
   fragmenting and decomposing the protecting leaf litter covers. Even
   though the diversity level did not show a significant influence, single
   leaf species in monocultures show rather different impacts on sediment
   discharge and thus, erosion control. In our experiment, runoff plots
   with leaf litter from Machilus thunbergii showed the highest sediment
   discharge (68.0 gm(-2)) whereas plots with Cyclobalanopsis glauca showed
   the smallest rates (7.9 gm(-2)). Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Higher species diversity can improve community performance within a
   species guild when different species complement each other in their use
   of the available niche, such as through resource partitioning. However,
   species in one guild of organisms may act as resources for another such
   that the diversity in one guild alters the realized niche for species in
   another. Yet, it remains largely untested as to whether diversity in one
   guild of organisms influences species complementarity in another. The
   productivity and diversity in plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
   fungal communities can be positively associated with each other through
   their typically mutualistic exchange of resources. Here, we utilized
   these two interacting species guilds to determine whether greater
   diversity in one influences species complementarity in the other. This
   was performed by creating monocultures and a mixture of a grass, forb
   and legume in a full factorial design with monocultures and a mixture of
   four AM fungi. The presence of AM fungi reduced differences in the
   performance among plant species and greater diversity of fungi generally
   improved plant productivity over the average of the fungal monocultures.
   However, plant species complementarity was not greatest with a higher
   diversity of fungi and was only positive with a particular fungal
   monoculture. AM fungal abundance was not affected by plant diversity,
   but was greatly reduced in the grass monoculture compared to the other
   plant communities. Variation in fungal complementarity among plant
   communities was low overall and was little influenced by plant
   diversity.Synthesis. Using a model plant-mycorrhizal system, our results
   suggest that the composition rather than the diversity of species within
   one guild may be more influential in determining how species function
   within an associated species guild. However, our model system does not
   represent a broad gradient of diversity in either plant or fungal
   communities and only assesses the initial growth phase. Nonetheless, our
   results highlight that changes in species compositions in one species
   guild can affect the functioning of species diversity in another.}},

Abstract = {{The geological record of prehistoric rock avalanches provides invaluable
   data for assessing the hazard posed by these rare but destructive mass
   movements. Here we investigate two large rock avalanches in the Obersee
   valley of the Glarner Alps, Switzerland, providing detailed mapping of
   landslide and related Quaternary phenomena, revised volume estimates for
   each event and surface exposure dating of rock avalanche deposits. The
   Rautispitz rock avalanche originated from the southern flank of the
   Obersee valley, releasing approximately 91 million m(3) of limestone on
   steeply-dipping bedding planes. Debris had maximum horizontal travel
   distance of similar to 5000 m, a fahrboeschung angle (relating fall
   height to length) of 18 degrees, and was responsible for the creation of
   Lake Obersee; deposits are more than 130 m thick in places. The Platten
   rock avalanche encompassed a source volume of 11 million m(3) sliding
   from the northern flank of the Obersee valley on similar steeply-dipping
   limestone beds (bedrock forms a syncline under the valley). Debris had a
   maximum horizontal travel distance of 1600 m with a fahrboeschung angle
   of 21 degrees, and is more than 80 m thick in places. Deposits of the
   Platten rock avalanche are superposed atop those from the Rautispitz
   event at the end of the Obersee valley where they dam Lake Haslensee.
   Runout for both events was simulated using the dynamic analysis code
   DAN3D; results showed excellent match to mapped deposit extents and
   thickness and helped confirm the hypothesized single-event failure
   scenarios. Cl-36 cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating of 13
   deposited boulders revealed a Younger Dryas age of 12.6 +/- 1.0 Ka for
   the Rautispitz rock avalanche and a mid-Holocene age of 6.1 +/- 0.8 Ka
   for the Platten rock avalanche. A seismological trigger is proposed for
   the former event due to potentially correlated turbidite deposits in
   nearby Lake Zurich. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite growing interest in ecological consequences of parasitism in
   food webs, relatively little is known about effects of parasites on
   long-term population dynamics of non-host species or about whether such
   effects are density or trait mediated.
   We studied a tri-trophic food chain comprised of (i) a bacterial basal
   resource (Serratia fonticola), (ii) an intermediate consumer (Paramecium
   caudatum), (iii) a top predator (Didinium nasutum) and (iv) a parasite
   of the intermediate consumer (Holospora undulata). A fully factorial
   experimental manipulation of predator and parasite presence/absence was
   combined with analyses of population dynamics, modelling and analyses of
   host (Paramecium) morphology and behaviour.
   Predation and parasitism each reduced the abundance of the intermediate
   consumer (Paramecium), and parasitism indirectly reduced the abundance
   of the basal resource (Serratia). However, in combination, predation and
   parasitism had non-additive effects on the abundance of the intermediate
   consumer, as well as on that of the basal resource. In both cases, the
   negative effect of parasitism seemed to be effaced by predation.
   Infection of the intermediate consumer reduced predator abundance.
   Modelling and additional experimentation revealed that this was most
   likely due to parasite reduction of intermediate host abundance (a
   density-mediated effect), as opposed to changes in predator functional
   or numerical response.
   Parasitism altered morphological and behavioural traits, by reducing
   host cell length and increasing the swimming speed of cells with
   moderate parasite loads. Additional tests showed no significant
   difference in Didinium feeding rate on infected and uninfected hosts,
   suggesting that the combination of these modifications does not affect
   host vulnerability to predation. However, estimated rates of encounter
   with Serratia based on these modifications were higher for infected
   Paramecium than for uninfected Paramecium.
   A mixture of density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect effects of
   parasitism on non-host species creates rich and complex possibilities
   for effects of parasites in food webs that should be included in
   assessments of possible impacts of parasite eradication or introduction.}},

   show that the SRM option lacks robustness. We then analyse the welfare
   consequences of basing the SRM decision on wrong assumptions about its
   side-effects, and show that total output losses are considerable and
   increase with the error horizon. This reinforces the need to balance the
   policy portfolio in favour of mitigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Segregation distorters located on sex chromosomes are predicted to sweep
   to fixation and cause extinction via a shortage of one sex, but in
   nature they are often found at low, stable frequencies. One potential
   resolution to this longstanding puzzle involves female multiple mating
   (polyandry). Because many meiotic drivers severely reduce the sperm
   competitive ability of their male carriers, females are predicted to
   evolve more frequent polyandry and thereby promote sperm competition
   when a meiotic driver invades. Consequently, the driving chromosome's
   relative fitness should decline, halting or reversing its spread. We
   used formal modeling to show that this initially appealing hypothesis
   cannot resolve the puzzle alone: other selective pressures (e.g., low
   fitness of drive homozygotes) are required to establish a stable meiotic
   drive polymorphism. However, polyandry and meiotic drive can strongly
   affect one another's frequency, and polyandrous populations may be
   resistant to the invasion of rare drive mutants.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and reactive nitrogen (N)
   concentrations have been increasing due to human activities and impact
   the global carbon (C) cycle by affecting plant photosynthesis and
   decomposition processes in soil. Large amounts of C are stored in plants
   and soils, but the mechanisms behind the stabilization of plant- and
   microbial-derived organic matter (OM) in soils are still under debate
   and it is not clear how N deposition affects soil OM dynamics. Here, we
   studied the effects of 4years of elevated (C-13-depleted) CO2 and N
   deposition in forest ecosystems established in open-top chambers on
   composition and turnover of fatty acids (FAs) in plants and soils. FAs
   served as biomarkers for plant- and microbial-derived OM in soil density
   fractions. We analyzed above- and belowground plant biomass of beech and
   spruce trees as well as soil density fractions for the total organic C
   and FA molecular and isotope (C-13) composition. FAs did not accumulate
   relative to total organic C in fine mineral fractions, showing that FAs
   are not effectively stabilized by association with soil minerals. The
   C-13 values of FAs in plant biomass increased under high N deposition.
   However, the N effect was only apparent under elevated CO2 suggesting a
   N limitation of the system. In soil fractions, only isotope compositions
   of short-chain FAs (C16+18) were affected. Fractions of new'
   (experimental-derived) FAs were calculated using isotope depletion in
   elevated CO2 plots and decreased from free light to fine mineral
   fractions. New' FAs were higher in short-chain compared to long-chain
   FAs (C20-30), indicating a faster turnover of short-chain compared to
   long-chain FAs. Increased N deposition did not significantly affect the
   quantity of new' FAs in soil fractions, but showed a tendency of
   increased amounts of old' (pre-experimental) C suggesting that
   decomposition of old' C is retarded by high N inputs.}},

Abstract = {{The flora of southern Africa is, for its latitude and area, very
   species-rich. Although the hyperdiverse Cape flora contributes almost
   half of this richness, three other radiations (desert, grassland, and
   woodland) contribute significantly to the botanical wealth of southern
   Africa. Each radiation occurs in a different ecological setting and has
   a different diversification history. Such parallel radiations can
   develop in suitably complex environments, given gradual change through
   time and no region wide catastrophes. These four radiations cross-seeded
   each other, with clades spawning subclades in other radiations, thus
   linking all four into one complex radiation. This led to an increase in
   the number of diversifying clades in each radiation. Such complex
   radiations accumulate diversifying lineages over a long time, spawn
   daughter radiations on other continents, and become powerhouses of
   global-biodiversity generation. We suggest that several of the most
   species-rich regions may harbor such complex radiations.}},

Abstract = {{In many species, females have evolved behavioral strategies to reduce
   the risk of infanticide. For instance, polyandry can create paternity
   confusion that inhibits males from killing offspring they could have
   sired. Here, the authors propose that females could socially obtain the
   same benefits by nesting communally. Singly sired litters could be
   perceived as a large multiply sired litter once pooled together in a
   single nest. Long-term data from a wild house mouse population showed
   that monandrous litters (singly sired) were more common in communal than
   in solitary nests and 85\% of them were raised with litters sired by
   different males hence becoming effectively polyandrous (multiply sired).
   These socially polyandrous litters had significantly higher offspring
   survival than genetically or socially monandrous litters and reached a
   similar survival to that of multiply sired litters raised in solitary or
   communal nests. Furthermore, the number of sires within nests
   significantly improved offspring survival whereas the number of mothers
   did not. These results suggest that the survival benefits associated
   with communal nesting are driven by polyandry and not communal defense.
   This socially mediated polyandry was as efficient as multiple paternity
   in preventing infanticide, and may also occur in other infanticidal and
   polytocous species where the caring parent exhibits social
   behavior.Communal nesting allows social females to avoid infanticide in
   much the same way as multiple mating: through paternity confusion.
   Litters sired by a single male can be perceived as a large
   multiply-sired litter once pooled together in a communal nest. This
   socially mediated polyandry was as efficient as multiple paternity in
   preventing infanticide. The number of mothers in communal nests did not
   explain offspring survival hence rejecting the communal defense
   hypothesis.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{One of the grand challenges in glacier research is to assess the total
   ice volume and its global distribution. Over the past few decades the
   compilation of a world glacier inventory has been well-advanced both in
   institutional set-up and in spatial coverage. The inventory is
   restricted to glacier surface observations. However, although thickness
   has been observed on many glaciers and ice caps around the globe, it has
   not yet been published in the shape of a readily available database.
   Here, we present a standardized database of glacier thickness
   observations compiled by an extensive literature review and from
   airborne data extracted from NASA's Operation IceBridge. This database
   contains ice thickness observations from roughly 1100 glaciers and ice
   caps including 550 glacier-wide estimates and 750,000 point
   observations. A comparison of these observational ice thicknesses with
   results from area- and slope-dependent approaches reveals large
   deviations both from the observations and between different estimation
   approaches. For glaciers and ice caps all estimation approaches show a
   tendency to overestimation. For glaciers the median relative absolute
   deviation lies around 30\% when analyzing the different estimation
   approaches. This initial database of glacier and ice caps thickness will
   hopefully be further enlarged and intensively used for a better
   understanding of the global glacier ice volume and its distribution. (C)

Abstract = {{Human activity affects properties and development of ecosystems across
   the globe, to such a degree that it is now challenging to get baseline
   values for undisturbed ecosystems. This is especially true for soil
   development, which is potentially affected by land-use history and holds
   a legacy of past human interventions. Therefore, it is still largely
   unknown for most ecozones how soil would have developed naturally'.
   Here, we show undisturbed soil development, i.e. the processes of
   weathering and accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM), by comparing
   pristine with grazed sites in the high Andes (4500 m) of southern Peru.
   We located study plots on a large ledge (0.2 km(2)) that is only
   accessible with mountaineering equipment. Plots with pristine vegetation
   were compared to rangeland plots that were presumably under relatively
   constant grazing management for at least four millennia. Vegetation
   change, induced by grazing management, led to lower vegetation cover of
   the soil, thereby increasing soil surface temperatures and soil
   acidification. Both factors increased weathering in rangeland soils.
   Formation of pedogenic oxides with high surface area explained
   preservation of SOM, with positive feedback to acidification. Higher
   contents of pyrophosphate extractable Fe and Al oxides indicated the
   importance of organo-mineral associations for SOM stabilization on
   rangeland sites, which are likely responsible for a higher degree of
   humification. This higher degree of humification induced melanization
   (darker colour) of the rangeland soils which, together with sparse
   vegetation cover, also feeds back to soil temperature. With this work,
   we present a conceptual framework of positive feedback links between
   human-induced vegetation change, soil development and accumulation of
   SOM, which is only possible due to the unique baseline values of a
   pristine ecosystem. Using inaccessibility' as a tool to quantify human
   impact in future interdisciplinary studies may push research forward on
   evaluating anthropogenic impact on Earth's ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Parasite Fitness Traits Under Environmental Variation: Disentangling the
   Roles of a Chytrid's Immediate Host and External Environment}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{645-656}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Parasite environments are heterogeneous at different levels. The first
   level of variability is the host itself. The second level represents the
   external environment for the hosts, to which parasites may be exposed
   during part of their life cycle. Both levels are expected to affect
   parasite fitness traits. We disentangle the main and interaction effects
   of variation in the immediate host environment, here the diatom
   Asterionella formosa (variables host cell volume and host condition
   through herbicide pre-exposure) and variation in the external
   environment (variables host density and acute herbicide exposure) on
   three fitness traits (infection success, development time and
   reproductive output) of a chytrid parasite. Herbicide exposure only
   decreased infection success in a low host density environment. This
   result reinforces the hypothesis that chytrid zoospores use
   photosynthesis-dependent chemical cues to locate its host. At high host
   densities, chemotaxis becomes less relevant due to increasing chance
   contact rates between host and parasite, thereby following the
   mass-action principle in epidemiology. Theoretical support for this
   finding is provided by an agent-based simulation model. The immediate
   host environment (cell volume) substantially affected parasite
   reproductive output and also interacted with the external herbicide
   exposed environment. On the contrary, changes in the immediate host
   environment through herbicide pre-exposure did not increase infection
   success, though it had subtle effects on zoospore development time and
   reproductive output. This study shows that both immediate host and
   external environment as well as their interaction have significant
   effects on parasite fitness. Disentangling these effects improves our
   understanding of the processes underlying parasite spread and disease
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing using airborne imaging spectroscopy (AIS) is known to
   retrieve fundamental optical properties of ecosystems. However, the
   value of these properties for predicting plant species distribution
   remains unclear. Here, we assess whether such data can add value to
   topographic variables for predicting plant distributions in French and
   Swiss alpine grasslands. We fitted statistical models with high spectral
   and spatial resolution reflectance data and tested four optical indices
   sensitive to leaf chlorophyll content, leaf water content and leaf area
   index. We found moderate added-value of AIS data for predicting alpine
   plant species distribution. Contrary to expectations, differences
   between species distribution models (SDMs) were not linked to their
   local abundance or phylogenetic/functional similarity. Moreover,
   spectral signatures of species were found to be partly site-specific. We
   discuss current limits of AIS-based SDMs, highlighting issues of scale
   and informational content of AIS data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares two Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies

   overall conclusion for the case of a news magazine namely that the
   tablet version of the magazine has environmental advantages over the
   print version there are significant differences in the details of the
   LCA results. We show how these differences can be explained by
   differences in the methodological approaches used for life cycle
   inventory (LCI) modelling, in particular the use of rough average data
   versus the attempt to use the most specific and detailed data as
   possible. We conclude that there are several issues in LCA practice (at
   least when applied in the domain of media) that can significantly
   influence the results already at the LCI level: The data collection
   strategy used (e.g. relying on desk-based research or dismantling a
   given device) and the decisions made at inventory level with regard to
   parameters with significant geographic variability, such as the
   electricity mix or recycling quotas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{International organizations sometimes institutionalize country groupings
   by specifying differentiated commitments that may, in turn, affect
   negotiation dynamics. Drawing on incentive-based and socialization
   arguments, we develop a ``constructed peer group{''} hypothesis
   suggesting that by creating these groups those organizations may
   actually construct new lines of confrontation over and above the
   substance-based disagreements existing between countries. This generates
   a particular type of path dependence, rendering broad-based
   international agreements more difficult in the future.
   We analyze this question at the example of the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change's increasingly politicized split between
   Annex I and non-Annex I countries. Using a self-coded dataset of country
   oral statements during the negotiations between December 2007 and
   December 2009 we assess whether Annex I membership influences a
   country's stance toward other countries' arguments, while controlling
   for country characteristics that may drive their preferences and the
   affiliation to Annex I. We find that the split between Annex I and
   non-Annex I has indeed influenced negotiation behavior and amplified the
   divide between developing and industrialized countries in the climate
   negotiations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The present study investigates the use expectations,
   prevalence and frequency of neuroenhancement drug (ND) use among the
   Swiss male population, separating college students from others. Methods:
   Young Swiss men were invited to participate in the Cohort Study on
   Substance Use Risk Factors. A total of 5,967 participants responded to
   questions on six types of NDs (wakefulness medication, antidepressants,
   Alzheimer's disease medication, Parkinson's disease medication,
   attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication, and
   beta-blockers). The frequency of use depending on five expectations (to
   enhance wakefulness, attention, memory, concentration and stress
   reduction) was analyzed for a twelve-month period. Results: (1) About
   3\% of the sample indicated use of at least one ND; (2) ADHD medication
   was the most prevalent; (3) The type of ND preferred differed depending
   on academic status (4). Quantitatively, over the year, college student
   users used ND much less frequently than other users. Conclusions:
   Prevalence of ND use is low in Switzerland relative to other countries
   such as the United States. Patterns of ND use differed depending on
   academic status, suggesting that while college student ND users tended
   to do so rarely (probably to enhance cognitive abilities for exams),
   non-college male users used other NDs more frequently (probably to ``get
   high{''}).}},

   bootstrap support. Trebouxia arboricola,T. decolorans and closely
   related, unnamed Trebouxia species, all belonging to clade A, were found
   as photobionts of Xanthoria species. Xanthomendoza species associated
   with either T. decolorans (clade A), T. impressa, T. gelatinosa (clade
   I) or with an unnamed Trebouxia species. Trebouxia gelatinosa genotypes
   (clade I) were the photobionts of Teloschistes chrysophthalmus,T.
   hosseusianus and Josefpoeltia parva. Only weak correlations between
   distribution patterns of algal genotypes and environmental conditions or
   geographical location were observed.}},

Title = {{The use of the local flora in Switzerland: A comparison of past and
   recent medicinal plant knowledge}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{151}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: This analysis of documented medicinal
   plants of the Swiss Flora over the last two millennia provides a rich
   source of knowledge on earlier uses of plants and use patterns of the
   local flora. We ask which local plant species were used during different
   time periods of the last 2000 years and how the numbers of species and
   the use intensity of specific plant families, growth forms and habitats
   changed over time.
   Materials and methods: Totally 25 herbals from the antiquity, monastic
   medicine, Renaissance, early modern era and the contemporary time as
   well as five recent ethnobotanical studies were considered. Use patterns
   were analysed with the Bayesian approach.
   Results: A total of 768 species, i.e. 32\% of the vascular plants of the
   Swiss Flora have been documented as medicinal plants. Numbers increase
   until the monastic period (366 spp.) and the Renaissance (476) and
   remain relatively stable since then (modern and contemporary era: 477).
   But, 465 formerly documented species do not occur in the ethnobotanical
   studies and thus seem not to be used any more. Overall, 104 species are
   documented through all time periods. Archeophytes, trees and forest
   plants are generally overrepresented in herbals from all time periods
   while plants from above the timberline are generally underrepresented.
   Most widely used are the Lamiaceae and Apiaceae.
   Conclusion: A constant body of medicinal plant knowledge in Switzerland
   exists since ancient time. This knowledge was always influenced by
   knowledge from neighboring countries and no ``typical Swiss
   specialties{''} seem to exist. Medicinal plants are not randomly chosen
   from the available flora. Certain species are deliberately introduced
   others are neglected. This process, which is still ongoing, can be
   traced back with the help of herbals to the antiquity. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We use remote-sensing and GIS technologies to monitor glacier changes in
   the Koshi River basin, central Himalaya. The results indicate that in
   2009 there were 2061 glaciers in this region, with a total area of 3225
   90.3 km(2). This glacier population is divided into 1290 glaciers, with
   a total area of 1961 +/- 54.9 km(2), on the north side of the Himalaya
   (NSH), and 771 glaciers, with a total area of 1264 +/- 35.4 km(2), on
   the south side of the Himalaya (SSH). From 1976 to 2009, glacier area in
   the basin decreased by about 19 +/- 5.6\% (0.59 +/- 0.17\% a(-1)).
   Glacier reduction was slightly faster on SSH (20.3 +/- 5.6\%) than on
   NSH (18.8 +/- 5.6\%). The maximum contribution to glacier area loss came
   from glaciers within the 1-5 km(2) area interval, which accounted for
   32\% of total area loss between 1976 and 2009. The number of glaciers in
   the Koshi River catchment decreased by 145 between 1976 and 2009.
   Glacier area on SSH decreased at a rate of 6.2 +/- 3.2\% (0.68 +/-
   0.36\% a(-1)), faster than on NSH, where the rate was 2.5 +/- 3.2\%
   (0.27 +/- 0.36\% a(-1)) during 2000-09. Based on records from Tingri
   weather station, we infer that temperature increase and precipitation
   decrease were the main causes of glacier thinning and retreat during the
   1976-2000 period. Glacier retreat during the 2000-09 period appears to
   be controlled by temperature increase, since precipitation increase over
   this period did not offset ice losses to surface melting.}},

Abstract = {{Photobiont diversity within populations of Xanthoria parietina was
   studied at the species level by means of ITS analyses and at the
   subspecific level with fingerprinting techniques (RAPD-PCR) applied to
   sterile cultured algal isolates. Populations from coastal, rural and
   urban sites from NW, SW and central France and from NE Switzerland were
   investigated. Between 8 and 63 samples per population, altogether 150
   isolates, were subjected to phenetic and ordination analyses. Epiphytic
   samples of X. parietina associated with different genotypes of Trebouxia
   decolorans but saxicolous samples contained T. arboricola. For
   comparison the T. gelatinosa photobiont of a small population of
   Teloschistes chrysophthalmus (4 samples) was investigated. ITS sequences
   of T. decolorans isolates from different geographic locations were
   largely similar. In all populations a surprisingly high diversity of
   genotypes was observed in Trebouxia isolated from lichen thalli growing
   side by side. As Trebouxia spp. are assumed to be asexually reproducing
   haplonts, the genetic background of this diversity is discussed.
   Fingerprinting techniques are a powerful tool for obtaining valuable
   insights into the genetic diversity within the algal partner of
   lichen-forming fungi at the population level, provided that sterile
   cultured isolates are available.}},

Abstract = {{Fossil bamboo leaf blades and culms from the middle Miocene deposits of
   Sanzhangtian, Zhenyuan County, Yunnan, Southwest China are reported for
   the first time. The distinctive pseudopetioles and parallelodromous
   venation patterns of the leaf blades and the nodal morphology of the
   culms support the placement of the fossils into Poaceae subfamily
   Bambusoideae. We describe one new genus and four new species. Bambusium
   angustifolia L. Wang et Z.K. Zhou, sp. nov. has leaf blades
   0.7-1.6(1.27) cm in width with 3-6(4) lateral veins on both sides of the
   midrib. Leaf blades of Bambusium latifolia L. Wang et Z.K. Zhou, sp.
   nov. are 1.4-3.8 (2.16) cm wide with 4-7 (6) lateral veins on both sides
   of the midrib. Culms of Bambusiculmus lotus L. Wang et Z.K. Zhou, sp.
   nov. have an internodal external diameter of 1.6-2.9 (2.5) cm, and more
   or less horizontal nodal line and supranodal ridge, while culm of
   Bambusiculmus angustus L. Wang et Z.K. Zhou, sp. nov. has an internodal
   external diameter of only 1.5 cm, and horizontal supranodal ridge and
   oblique nodal line. Our findings provide the earliest evidence of bamboo
   fossil leaf blades and culms with detailed external morphological
   characters in China. These fossils indicate that bamboos in Yunnan began
   to diversify no later than the middle Miocene. Because Yunnan is one of
   the biodiversity centres of modern bamboos, these fossils provide new
   insights into bamboo biogeography. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Shallow landslides pose substantial risks to people and infrastructure
   in mountain areas. Their occurrence is influenced by groundwater
   dynamics and bedrock characteristics. The bedrock may drain or
   contribute to groundwater in the overlying soil mass, depending on the
   hydraulic conductivity, degree of fracturing, saturation, and hydraulic
   head. Here, we present a detailed case study for a slope from Central
   Switzerland, where soil-bedrock interactions were responsible for
   triggering shallow landslides in the past. The bedrock in the study area
   represents a succession of heavily fissured conglomerate-sandstone beds
   and weathered marlstone layers, which are overlain by a clayey soil
   layer. There is evidence of a temporally confined aquifer in bedrock
   fractures from a severe storm event in August 2005. We derived a
   detailed geological model of the slope from electrical resistivity
   tomography surveys, borehole data, and bedrock outcrops. Then, the
   groundwater response to 32 rainfall events was monitored in the soil
   layer and in different bedrock layers from November 2010 to November
   2011. We observed a fast and substantial rise of the hydraulic head in
   the bedrock, which was in contrast to the low permeability of the soil
   layer. The data suggest that rapid groundwater flow through bedrock
   fractures caused the immediate increase of the hydraulic head. Our
   observations document how water pressure builds up in fractured bedrock
   below a low permeability soil cover during heavy rainfall, which may
   trigger shallow landslides.}},

   phosphorus precipitation, were implemented throughout the industrialized
   world, leading to reoligotrophication in many freshwater lakes. To
   understand and assess the effects of reoligotrophication on primary
   productivity, we analyzed 28 years of C-14 assimilation rates, as well
   as other biotic and abiotic parameters, such as global radiation,
   nutrient concentrations and plankton densities in peri-alpine Lake
   Lucerne, Switzerland. Using a simple productivity-light relationship, we
   estimated continuous primary production and discussed the relation
   between productivity and observed limnological parameters. Furthermore,
   we assessed the uncertainty of our modeling approach based on monthly
   C-14 assimilation measurements using Monte Carlo simulations. Results
   confirm that monthly sampling of productivity is sufficient for
   identifying long-term trends in productivity and that conservation
   management has successfully improved water quality during the past three
   decades via reducing nutrients and primary production in the lake.
   However, even though nutrient concentrations have remained constant in
   recent years, annual primary production varies significantly from year
   to year. Despite the fact that nutrient concentrations have decreased by
   more than an order of magnitude, primary production has decreased only
   slightly. These results suggest that primary production correlates well
   to nutrients availability but meteorological conditions lead to
   interannual variability regardless of the trophic status of the lake.
   Accordingly, in oligotrophic freshwaters meteorological forcing may
   reduce productivity impacting on the entire food chain of the ecosystem.}},

Title = {{The impact of pre- and post-natal contexts on immunity, glucocorticoids

Abstract = {{1. Genetic background, prenatal and post-natal early-life conditions
   influence the development of interconnected physiological systems and
   thereby shape the phenotype. Certain combinations of genotypes and pre-
   and post-natal conditions may provide higher fitness in a specific
   environmental context.
   2. Here, we investigated how grey partridges Perdix perdix of two
   strains (wild and domesticated) cope physiologically with pre- and
   post-natal predictable vs. unpredictable food supply. Food
   unpredictability occurs frequently in wild environments and requires
   physiological and behavioural adjustments.
   3. Well-orchestrated and efficient physiological systems are presumably
   more vital in a wild environment as compared to captivity. We thus
   predicted that wild-strain grey partridges have a stronger immunity,
   glucocorticoid (GC) stress response and oxidative stress resistance
   (OSR) than domesticated birds, which have undergone adaptations to
   captivity. We also predicted that wild-strain birds react more strongly
   to environmental stimuli and, when faced with harsh prenatal conditions,
   are better able to prepare their offspring for similarly poor post-natal
   conditions than birds of domesticated origin.
   4. We found that wild-strain offspring were physiologically better
   prepared for stressful situations as compared to the domesticated
   strain. They had a high GC stress response and a high OSR when kept
   under predictable food supply. Wild-strain parents reacted to prenatal
   unpredictable food supply by lowering their offspring's GC stress
   response, which potentially lowered GC-induced oxidative pressure. No
   such pattern was evident in the domesticated birds.
   5. Irrespective of strain and prenatal feeding scheme, post-natal
   unpredictable food supply boosted immune indices, and GC stress response
   was negatively related to antibody response in females and to
   mitochondrial superoxide production.
   6. Wild-strain grey partridge showed fitness-relevant physiological
   advantages and appeared to prepare their offspring for the prospective
   environment. Negative relationships between GC stress response, immunity
   and oxidative indices imply a pivotal role of an organism's oxidative
   balance and support the importance of considering multiple physiological
   systems simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis step in the production of synthetic natural gas from wood,

   ethylene to ethane and further to methane under isothermal fluidised bed
   methanation conditions could be shown. Lower temperatures favour the
   production of the intermediate ethane while high temperatures cause the
   formation of carbon depositions and carbon whiskers. Applying optimal
   operation conditions, the hydrogenation of the unsaturated olefin not
   only avoids the deposition of carbon or coke, but also leads to an
   increase of the higher heating value (HHV) of the produced (raw) SNG.

Title = {{The future sea-level rise contribution of Greenland's glaciers and ice

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{We calculate the future sea-level rise contribution from the surface
   mass balance of all of Greenland's glaciers and ice caps (GICs, similar
   to 90 000 km(2)) using a simplified energy balance model which is driven
   by three future climate scenarios from the regional climate models
   HIRHAM5, RACMO2 and MAR. Glacier extent and surface elevation are
   modified during the mass balance model runs according to a glacier
   retreat parameterization. Mass balance and glacier surface change are
   both calculated on a 250 m resolution digital elevation model yielding a
   high level of detail and ensuring that important feedback mechanisms are
   considered. The mass loss of all GICs by 2098 is calculated to be 2016
   +/- 129 Gt (HIRHAM5 forcing), 2584 +/- 109 Gt (RACMO2) and 3907 +/- 108
   Gt (MAR). This corresponds to a total contribution to sea-level rise of
   5.8 +/- 0.4, 7.4 +/- 0.3 and 11.2 +/- 0.3 mm, respectively. Sensitivity
   experiments suggest that mass loss could be higher by 20-30\% if a
   strong lowering of the surface albedo were to take place in the future.
   It is shown that the sea-level rise contribution from the north-easterly
   regions of Greenland is reduced by increasing precipitation while mass
   loss in the southern half of Greenland is dominated by steadily
   decreasing summer mass balances. In addition we observe glaciers in the
   north-eastern part of Greenland changing their characteristics towards
   greater activity and mass turnover.}},

Abstract = {{All Illicium spp. have explosive fruits, which is a unique character
   among the basal grade of angiosperms. Illicium fruits consist of several
   ventrally dehiscing follicles developing from conduplicate carpels, with
   a prominent, slightly postgenitally fused ventral slit. The closure of
   the ventral slit is also secured by two mirror-symmetrical massive
   longitudinal sclerenchymatous bands in the mesocarp along the edges and
   by turgor pressure. The pericarp differentiates into a fleshy (or
   coriaceous) peripheral zone (exocarp and mesocarp) with numerous
   ethereal-oil-containing cells and a sclerenchymatous (single-layered,
   palisade) inner zone (endocarp). Dehydration of the fleshy zone of the
   pericarp and partial compression of the epidermal sclereids with
   U-shaped wall thickenings lining the ventral suture are instrumental in
   explosive fruitlet dehiscence. Generally, the fruit structure of
   Illicium differs dramatically from those in other early diverging
   angiosperms. Gynoecium and fruit structure (and a probable early
   Cretaceous divergence from the Schisandra-Kadsura clade) provide
   evidence for treatment of Illicium as separate from Schisandraceae s.s.

Pages = {{185-198}},

Abstract = {{Actinobacteria of the acI lineage are the most abundant microbes in
   freshwater systems, but there are so far no pure living cultures of
   these organisms, possibly because of metabolic dependencies on other
   microbes. This, in turn, has hampered an in-depth assessment of the
   genomic basis for their success in the environment. Here we present
   genomes from 16 axenic cultures of acI Actinobacteria. The isolates were
   not only of minute cell size, but also among the most streamlined
   free-living microbes, with extremely small genome sizes (1.2-1.4 Mbp)
   and low genomic GC content. Genome reduction in these bacteria might
   have led to auxotrophy for various vitamins, amino acids and reduced
   sulphur sources, thus creating dependencies to co-occurring organisms
   (the ` Black Queen' hypothesis). Genome analyses, moreover, revealed a
   surprising degree of inter-and intraspecific diversity in metabolic
   pathways, especially of carbohydrate transport and metabolism, and
   mainly encoded in genomic islands. The striking genotype
   microdiversification of acI Actinobacteria might explain their global
   success in highly dynamic freshwater environments with complex seasonal
   patterns of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon sources. We propose a
   new order within Actinobacteria ('Candidatus Nanopelagicales') with two
   new genera ('Candidatus Nanopelagicus' and `Candidatus Planktophila')

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2140-2158}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Hybridization is increasingly recognized as a significant evolutionary
   process, in particular because it can lead to introgression of genes
   from one species to another. A striking pattern of discordance in the
   amount of introgression between mitochondrial and nuclear markers exists
   such that substantial mitochondrial introgression is often found in
   combination with no or little nuclear introgression. Multiple mechanisms
   have been proposed to explain this discordance, including positive
   selection for introgressing mitochondrial variants, several types of
   sex-biases, drift, negative selection against introgression in the
   nuclear genome, and spatial expansion. Most of these hypotheses are
   verbal, and have not been quantitatively evaluated so far. We use
   individual-based, multilocus, computer simulations of secondary contact
   under a wide range of demographic and genetic scenarios to evaluate the
   ability of the different mechanisms to produce discordant introgression.
   Sex-biases and spatial expansions fail to produce substantial
   mito-nuclear discordance. Drift and nuclear selection can produce strong
   discordance, but only under a limited range of conditions. In contrast,
   selection on the mitochondrial genome produces strong discordance,
   particularly when dispersal rates are low. However, commonly used
   statistical tests have little power to detect this selection.
   Altogether, these results dismiss several popular hypotheses, and
   provide support for adaptive mitochondrial introgression.}},

Abstract = {{The end of the Pliocene marked the beginning of a period of great
   climatic variability and sea-level oscillations. Here, based on a new
   analysis of the fossil record, we identify a previously unrecognized
   extinction event among marine megafauna (mammals, seabirds, turtles and
   sharks) during this time, with extinction rates three times higher than
   in the rest of the Cenozoic, and with 36\% of Pliocene genera failing to
   survive into the Pleistocene. To gauge the potential consequences of
   this event for ecosystem functioning, we evaluate its impacts on
   functional diversity, focusing on the 86\% of the megafauna genera that
   are associated with coastal habitats. Seven (14\%) coastal functional
   entities (unique trait combinations) disappeared, along with 17\% of
   functional richness (volume of the functional space). The origination of
   new genera during the Pleistocene created new functional entities and
   contributed to a functional shift of 21\%, but minimally compensated for
   the functional space lost. Reconstructions show that from the late
   Pliocene onwards, the global area of the neritic zone significantly
   diminished and exhibited amplified fluctuations. We hypothesize that the
   abrupt loss of productive coastal habitats, potentially acting alongside
   oceanographic alterations, was a key extinction driver. The importance
   of area loss is supported by model analyses showing that animals with
   high energy requirements (homeotherms) were more susceptible to
   extinction. The extinction event we uncover here demonstrates that
   marine megafauna were more vulnerable to global environmental changes in
   the recent geological past than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimates of flood peaks, corresponding volumes, and
   hydrographs are required to design safe and cost-effective hydraulic
   structures. In this paper, we propose a statistical approach for the
   estimation of the design variables peak and volume by constructing
   synthetic design hydrographs for different flood types such as
   flash-floods, short-rain floods, long-rain floods, and rain-on-snow
   floods. Our approach relies on the fitting of probability density
   functions to observed flood hydrographs of a certain flood type and
   accounts for the dependence between peak discharge and flood volume. It
   makes use of the statistical information contained in the data and
   retains the process information of the flood type. The method was tested
   based on data from 39 mesoscale catchments in Switzerland and provides
   catchment specific and flood type specific synthetic design hydrographs
   for all of these catchments. We demonstrate that flood type specific
   synthetic design hydrographs are meaningful in flood-risk management
   when combined with knowledge on the seasonality and the frequency of
   different flood types.}},

Abstract = {{Due to frequent cases of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) in captive
   primates in Europe, 141 samples of food, which consisting of vegetables
   and fruits, were investigated for contamination with egg-DNA of
   taeniids. Each sample consisted of at least 40 heads of lettuce as well
   as various vegetables and fruits. The samples were purchased at
   different times of the year: either from September to November (autumn),
   originating from greenhouses or fields in the Basel region in the North
   of Switzerland, or in April and May (spring) when fruit and vegetables
   are sourced from throughout Europe from various wholesalers. Each sample
   was washed, and the washing water sieved through mesh apertures of 50 mm
   and 21 mm, respectively. The debris, including taeniid eggs, collected
   on the 21 mm sieve were investigated by a multiplex PCR-analysis
   followed by direct sequencing. In 17 (18\%) of the 95 samples collected
   in autumn, taeniid-DNA was detected (Taenia hydatigena in four, Taenia
   ovis in three, Taenia polyacantha in two and Hydatigera (Taenia)
   taeniaeformis in five cases). Similarly, in 13 (28\%) of the 46 samples
   collected during spring taeniid-DNA was detected (Echinococcus
   granulosus s.l. in two, Taenia crassiceps in one, T.hydatigena in two,
   Taenia multiceps/Taenia serialis in two, Taenia saginata in one and H.
   taeniaeformis in five cases). Although DNA of Echinococcus
   multilocularis was not found specifically in this study, the detection
   of other fox taeniids reveals that vegetables and fruit fed to the
   primates at the Zoo Basel at different times of the year and from
   different origin are contaminated with carnivore's faeces and therefore
   act as a potential source of AE infections. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{8679-8685}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Migratory birds are often faithful to wintering (nonbreeding) sites, and
   also migration timing is usually remarkably consistent, that is, highly
   repeatable. Spatiotemporal repeatability can be of advantage for
   multiple reasons, including familiarity with local resources and
   predators as well as avoiding the costs of finding a new place, for
   example, nesting grounds. However, when the environment is variable in
   space and time, variable site selection and timing might be more
   rewarding. To date, studies on spatial and temporal repeatability in
   short-lived long-distance migrants are scarce, most notably of
   first-time and subsequent migrations. Here, we investigated
   repeatability in autumn migration directions, wintering sites, and
   annual migration timing in Hoopoes (Upupa epops), a long-distance
   migrant, using repeated tracks of adult and first-time migrants. Even
   though autumn migration directions were mostly the same, individual
   wintering sites often changed from year to year with distances between
   wintering sites exceeding 1,000 km. The timing of migration was
   repeatable within an individual during autumn, but not during spring
   migration. We suggest that Hoopoes respond to variable environmental
   conditions such as north-south shifts in rainfall during winter and
   differing onset of the food availability during spring migration.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to control the cytoplasmic environment is a prerequisite for
   plants to cope with changing environmental conditions. During salt
   stress, for instance, Na+ and Cl- are sequestered into the vacuole to
   help maintain cytosolic ion homeostasis and avoid cellular damage. It
   has been observed that vacuolar ion uptake is tied to fluxes across the
   plasma membrane. The coordination of both transport processes and
   relative contribution to plant adaptation, however, is still poorly
   understood. To investigate the link between vacuolar anion uptake and
   whole-plant ion distribution during salinity, we used mutants of the
   only vacuolar Cl- channel described to date: the Arabidopsis
   (Arabidopsis thaliana) ALMT9. After 24-h NaCl treatment, almt9 knock-out
   mutants had reduced shoot accumulation of both Cl- and Na+. In contrast,
   almt9 plants complemented with a mutant variant of ALMT9 that exhibits
   enhanced channel activity showed higher Cl- and Na+ accumulation. The
   altered shoot ion contents were not based on differences in
   transpiration, pointing to a vacuolar function in regulating xylem
   loading during salinity. In line with this finding, GUS staining
   demonstrated that ALMT9 is highly expressed in the vasculature of shoots
   and roots. RNA-seq analysis of almt9 mutants under salinity revealed
   specific expression profiles of transporters involved in long-distance
   ion translocation. Taken together, our study uncovers that the capacity
   of vacuolar Cl- loading in vascular cells plays a crucial role in
   controlling whole-plant ion movement rapidly after onset of salinity.}},

Title = {{Quantifying population declines based on presence-only records for

Abstract = {{Accurate trend estimates are necessary for understanding which species
   are declining and which are most in need of conservation action.
   Imperfect species detection may result in unreliable trend estimates
   because this may lead to the overestimation of declines. Because many
   management decisions are based on population trend estimates, such
   biases could have severe consequences for conservation policy. We used
   an occupancy-modeling framework to estimate detectability and calculate
   nationwide population trends for 14 Swiss amphibian species both
   accounting for and ignoring imperfect detection. Through the application
   of International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List criteria to
   the different trend estimates, we assessed whether ignoring imperfect
   detection could affect conservation policy. Imperfect detection occurred
   for all species and detection varied substantially among species, which
   led to the overestimation of population declines when detectability was
   ignored. Consequently, accounting for imperfect detection lowered the
   red-list risk category for 5 of the 14 species assessed. We demonstrate
   that failing to consider species detectability can have serious
   consequences for species management and that occupancy modeling provides
   a flexible framework to account for observation bias and improve
   assessments of conservation status. A problem inherent to most
   historical records is that they contain presence-only data from which
   only relative declines can be estimated. A move toward the routine
   recording of nonobservation and absence data is essential if
   conservation practitioners are to move beyond this toward accurate
   population trend estimation.
   Cuantificacion de las Declinaciones Poblacionales Basada en los
   Registros de Presencia de las Valoraciones de la Lista Roja Se requieren
   estimaciones precisas de tendencias para entender cuales especies estan
   declinando y cuales estan mas necesitadas de acciones de conservacion.
   La deteccion imperfecta de especies puede resultar en estimaciones de
   tendencias poco confiables ya que esto puede llevar a la sobreestimacion
   de las declinaciones. Como muchas decisiones de manejo se basan en las
   estimaciones de las tendencias poblacionales, dichos sesgos podrian
   generar consecuencias severas en las politicas de conservacion.
   Utilizamos el marco de trabajo de un modelo de ocupacion para estimar lo
   detectable y calcular las tendencias nacionales de poblacion de 14
   especies de anfibios suizos, dando cuenta de e ignorando en ambos casos
   las detecciones imperfectas. Por medio de la aplicacion de criterios de
   la Lista Roja de la Union Internacional para la Conservacion de la
   Naturaleza a las diferentes estimaciones de tendencias valoramos si
   ignorar la deteccion imperfecta podria afectar a las politicas de
   conservacion. La deteccion imperfecta estuvo presente para todas las
   especies y esta vario sustancialmente entre especies, lo que derivo en
   la sobreestimacion de las declinaciones poblacionales cuando lo
   detectable fue ignorado. Como consecuencia, notar las detecciones
   imperfectas redujo la categoria de riesgo de la lista roja de cinco de
   las 14 especies valoradas. Demostramos que fallas en la consideracion de
   lo detectable de las especies puede tener consecuencias serias para el
   manejo de especies y que el modelo de ocupacion proporciona un marco de
   trabajo flexible para explicar los sesgos de observacion y mejorar las
   valoraciones del estado de conservacion. Un problema inherente para la
   mayoria de los registros historicos es que contienen datos de presencia
   de los cuales solo se pueden estimar declinaciones relativas. Dar un
   paso hacia el registro rutinario de la no-observacion y la ausencia de
   datos es esencial si quienes practican la conservacion desean sobrepasar
   esto e ir hacia la estimacion certera de las tendencias poblacionales.

Abstract = {{AimEcologically driven diversification can create spectacular diversity
   in both species numbers and form. However, the prediction that the match
   between intrinsic (e.g. functional trait) and extrinsic (e.g. climatic
   niche) variables may lead to evolutionary radiation has not been
   critically tested. Here, we test this hypothesis in the Southern
   Hemisphere plant family Proteaceae, which shows a spectacular diversity
   in open mediterranean shrublands in the Southwest Australian Floristic
   Region (SWAFR) and the Cape Floristic Region (CFR). Species in the
   Proteaceae family occupy habitats ranging from tropical rain forests to
   deserts and are remarkably variable in leaf morphology.
   LocationSouthern Hemisphere.
   MethodsWe built a phylogenetic tree for 337 Proteaceae species (21\% of
   the total), representing all main clades, climatic tolerances and
   morphologies, and collected leaf functional traits (leaf area,
   sclerophylly, leaf shape) for 261 species and climatic niche data for
   1645 species. Phylogenetic generalized least squares regression and
   quantitative-trait evolutionary model testing were used to investigate
   the evolutionary pathways of traits and climatic niches, and their
   effect on diversification rates.
   ResultsWe found that divergent selection may have caused lineages in
   open vegetation types to evolve towards trait and climatic niche optima
   distinct from those in closed forests. Furthermore, we show that the
   interaction between open habitats, dry, warm and/or mediterranean
   climates, and small, sclerophyllous, toothed leaves increases net
   diversification rates in Proteaceae.
   Main conclusionsOur results suggest that the evolution of specific leaf
   adaptations may have allowed Proteaceae to adapt to variable climatic
   niches and diversify extensively in open ecosystems such as those in the
   CFR and SWAFR. This match between morphology and environment may
   therefore more generally lead to evolutionary radiation.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel framework for conceptualising, quantifying and
   unifying discordant patterns of species richness along geographical
   gradients. While not itself explicitly mechanistic, this approach offers
   a path towards understanding mechanisms. In this study, we focused on
   the diverse patterns of species richness on mountainsides. We
   conjectured that elevational range midpoints of species may be drawn
   towards a single midpoint attractor - a unimodal gradient of
   environmental favourability. The midpoint attractor interacts with
   geometric constraints imposed by sea level and the mountaintop to
   produce taxon-specific patterns of species richness. We developed a
   Bayesian simulation model to estimate the location and strength of the
   midpoint attractor from species occurrence data sampled along
   mountainsides. We also constructed midpoint predictor models to test
   whether environmental variables could directly account for the observed
   patterns of species range midpoints. We challenged these models with 16
   elevational data sets, comprising 4500 species of insects, vertebrates
   and plants. The midpoint predictor models generally failed to predict
   the pattern of species midpoints. In contrast, the midpoint attractor
   model closely reproduced empirical spatial patterns of species richness
   and range midpoints. Gradients of environmental favourability, subject
   to geometric constraints, may parsimoniously account for elevational and
   other patterns of species richness.}},

Title = {{Impact of changing wind conditions on foraging and incubation success in

Abstract = {{1. Wind is an important climatic factor for flying animals as by
   affecting their locomotion, it can deeply impact their life-history
   characteristics.
   2. In the context of globally changing wind patterns, we investigated
   the mechanisms underlying recently reported increase in body mass of a
   population of wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) with increasing
   wind speed over time.
   3. We built a foraging model detailing the effects of wind on movement
   statistics and ultimately on mass gained by the forager and mass lost by
   the incubating partner. We then simulated the body mass of incubating
   pairs under varying wind scenarios. We tracked the frequency at which
   critical mass leading to nest abandonment was reached to assess
   incubation success.
   4. We found that wandering albatrosses behave as time minimizers during
   incubation as mass gain was independent of any movement statistics but
   decreased with increasing mass at departure. Individuals forage until
   their energy requirements, which are determined by their body
   conditions, are fulfilled. This can come at the cost of their partner's
   condition as mass loss of the incubating partner depended on trip
   duration. This behaviour is consistent with strategies of long-lived
   species which favoured their own survival over their current
   reproductive attempt. In addition, wind speed increased ground speed
   which in turn reduced trip duration and males foraged further away than
   females at high ground speed.
   5. Contrasted against an independent data set, the simulation performed
   satisfactorily for males but less so for females under current wind
   conditions. The simulation predicted an increase in male body mass
   growth rate with increasing wind speed, whereas females' rate decreased.
   This trend may provide an explanation for the observed increase in mass
   of males but not of females. Conversely, the simulation predicted very
   few nest abandonments, which is in line with the high breeding success
   of this species and is contrary to the hypothesis that wind patterns
   impact incubation success by altering foraging movement.}},

Abstract = {{Forging strong links between traits and performance is essential for
   understanding and predicting community assembly and dynamics. Functional
   trait analyses of trees that have correlated single-trait values with
   measures of performance such as growth and mortality have generally
   found weak relationships. A reason for these weak relationships is the
   failure to use individual-level trait data while simultaneously putting
   that data into the context of the abiotic setting, neighborhood
   composition, and the remaining axes constituting the overall phenotype.
   Here, utilizing detailed growth and trait data for 59 species of trees
   in a subtropical forest, we demonstrate that the individual-level
   functional trait values are strongly related to individual growth rates,
   and that the strength of these relationships critically depends on the
   context of that individual. We argue that our understanding of
   trait-performance relationships can be greatly improved with
   individual-level data so long as that data is put into the proper
   context.}},

Abstract = {{Vittarioid ferns compose a well-supported Glade of 100-130 species of
   highly simplified epiphytes in the family Pteridaceae. Generic
   circumscriptions within the vittarioid Glade were among the first in
   ferns to be evaluated and revised based on molecular phylogenetic data.
   Initial analyses of rbcL sequences revealed strong geographic structure
   and demonstrated that the two largest vittarioid genera, as then
   defined, each had phylogenetically distinct American and Old World
   components. The results of subsequent studies that included as many as
   36 individuals of 33 species, but still relied on a single gene, were
   generally consistent with the early findings. Here, we build upon the
   previous datasets, incorporating many more samples (138 individuals
   representing 72 species) and additional plastid markers (atpA, chlN,
   rbcL, rpoA). Analysis of our larger dataset serves to better
   characterize known lineages, reveals new lineages, and ultimately
   uncovers an underlying geographic signal that is even stronger than was
   previously appreciated. In our revised generic classification, we
   recognize a total of eleven vittarioid genera. Each genus, including the
   new genus Antrophyopsis (Benedict) Schuettp., stat. nov., is readily
   diagnosable based on morphology, with micromorphological characters
   related to soral paraphyses and spores complementing more obvious
   features such as venation and the distribution of sporangia. A key to
   the currently recognized vittarioid genera, brief generic descriptions,
   and five new species combinations are provided.}},

Title = {{Evolution of unusual morphologies in Lentibulariaceae (bladderworts and
   allies) and Podostemaceae (river-weeds): a pictorial report at the
   interface of developmental biology and morphological diversification}},

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background Various groups of flowering plants reveal profound
   ('saltational') changes of their bauplans (architectural rules) as
   compared with related taxa. These plants are known as morphological
   misfits that appear as rather large morphological deviations from the
   norm. Some of them emerged as morphological key innovations (perhaps
   `hopeful monsters') that gave rise to new evolutionary lines of
   organisms, based on (major) genetic changes.
   Scope This pictorial report places emphasis on released bauplans as
   typical for bladderworts (Utricularia, approx. 230 secies,
   Lentibulariaceae) and river-weeds (Podostemaceae, three subfamilies,
   approx. 54 genera, approx. 310 species). Bladderworts (Utricularia) are
   carnivorous, possessing sucking traps. They live as submerged aquatics
   (except for their flowers), as humid terrestrials or as epiphytes. Most
   Podostemaceae are restricted to rocks in tropical river-rapids and
   waterfalls. They survive as submerged haptophytes in these extreme
   habitats during the rainy season, emerging with their flowers
   afterwards. The recent scientific progress in developmental biology and
   evolutionary history of both Lentibulariaceae and Podostemaceae is
   summarized.
   Conclusions Lentibulariaceae and Podostemaceae follow structural rules
   that are different from but related to those of more typical flowering
   plants. The roots, stems and leaves - as still distinguishable in
   related flowering plants - are blurred ('fuzzy'). However, both families
   have stable floral bauplans. The developmental switches to unusual
   vegetative morphologies facilitated rather than prevented the evolution
   of species diversity in both families. The lack of one-to-one
   correspondence between structural categories and gene expression may
   have arisen from the re-use of existing genetic resources in novel
   contexts. Understanding what developmental patterns are followed in
   Lentibulariaceae and Podostemaceae is a necessary prerequisite to
   discover the genetic alterations that led to the evolution of these
   atypical plants. Future molecular genetic work on morphological misfits
   such as bladderworts and river-weeds will provide insight into
   developmental and evolutionary aspects of more typical vascular plants.}},

Abstract = {{RNA interference (RNAi) is a widely used approach to generate
   virus-resistant transgenic crops. However, issues of agricultural
   importance like the long-term durability of RNAi-mediated resistance
   under field conditions and the potential side effects provoked in the
   plant by the stable RNAi expression remain poorly investigated. Here, we
   performed field trials and molecular characterization studies of two
   homozygous trans genic tomato lines, with different selection markers,
   expressing an intron-hairpin RNA cognate to the Tomato yellow leaf curl
   virus (TYLCV) Cl gene. The tested F6 and F4 progenies of the respective
   kanamycin- and basta-resistant plants exhibited unchanged field
   resistance to TYLCV and stably expressed the transgene-derived short
   interfering RNA (siRNAs) to represent 6 to 8\% of the total plant small
   RNAs. This value outnumbered the average percentage of viral siRNAs in
   the nontransformed plants exposed to TYLCV-infested whiteflies. As a
   result of the RNAi transgene expression, a common set of up- and down
   regulated genes was revealed in the transcriptome profile of the plants
   selected from either of the two transgenic events. A previously
   unidentified geminivirus causing no symptoms of viral disease was
   detected in some of the transgenic plants. The novel virus acquired V1
   and V2 genes from TYLCV and C1, C2, C3, and C4 genes from a distantly
   related geminivirus and, thereby, it could evade the repressive
   sequence-specific action of transgene-derived siRNAs. Our findings shed
   light on the mechanisms of siRNA-directed antiviral silencing in
   transgenic plants and highlight the applicability limitations of this
   technology as it may alter the transcriptional pattern of nontarget
   genes.}},

Abstract = {{Insect pollination and pest control are pivotal functions sustaining
   global food production. However, they have mostly been studied in
   isolation and how they interactively shape crop yield remains largely
   unexplored. Using controlled field experiments, we found strong
   synergistic effects of insect pollination and simulated pest control on
   yield quantity and quality. Their joint effect increased yield by 23\%,
   with synergistic effects contributing 10\%, while their single
   contributions were 7\% and 6\%, respectively. The potential economic
   benefit for a farmer from the synergistic effects (12\%) was 1.8 times
   greater than their individual contributions (7\% each). We show that the
   principal underlying mechanism was a pronounced pest-induced reduction
   in flower lifetime, resulting in a strong reduction in the number of
   pollinator visits a flower receives during its lifetime. Our findings
   highlight the importance of non-additive interactions among ecosystem
   services (ES) when valuating, mapping or predicting them and reveal
   fundamental implications for ecosystem management and policy aimed at

Abstract = {{Plant species richness (PSR) increases nutrient uptake which depletes
   bioavailable nutrient pools in soil. No such relationship between plant
   uptake and availability in soil was found for phosphorus (P). We
   explored PSR effects on P mobilisation {[}phosphatase activity (PA)] in
   soil. PA increased with PSR. The positive PSR effect was not solely due
   to an increase in C-org concentrations because PSR remained significant
   if related to PA:C-org. An increase in PA per unit C-org increases the
   probability of the temporal and spatial match between substrate, enzyme
   and microorganism potentially serving as an adaption to competition.
   Carbon use efficiency of microorganisms (C-mic:C-org) increased with
   increasing PSR while enzyme exudation efficiency (PA:C-mic) remained
   constant. These findings suggest the need for efficient C rather than P
   cycling underlying the relationship between PSR and PA. Our results
   indicate that the coupling between C and P cycling in soil becomes
   tighter with increasing PSR.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated if an increase in species pool size leads to more
   pronounced turnover in local communities and assessed if this increase
   relates to stronger competition for environmental niches or to more
   random placement of species. We compared compositional turnover of
   pteridophytes (ferns and lycophytes) at 15 sites in mountain ecosystems
   on 13 islands in southeast Asia and Melanesia that mainly differed in
   the size of their species pool. Each site was sampled with 16 plots of
   20 x 20 m(2). Using multiple regression on distance matrices, we
   investigated the relationship between environmental distance and
   compositional turnover at different spatial extents within sites with
   different species pool sizes. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis
   that the intensity of competition increases with increasing species pool
   size. This was done by assessing how realized niche overlap and
   unevenness of communities relate to environmental distance and species
   pool size. With increasing species pool size, there was an increase in:
   a) proportional turnover in community composition, b) the importance of
   environmental distance for explaining turnover in community composition
   and c) a decrease in environmental niche overlap between species
   indicating an increasing importance of competition for community
   composition. Our results support the idea that increasing species pool
   size increases the competition for available environmental niches, and
   thereby leads to a tighter connection between environmental factors and
   community composition.}},

Abstract = {{Postcopulatory sexual selection is widely accepted to underlie the
   extraordinary diversification of sperm morphology. However, why does it
   favour longer sperm in some taxa but shorter in others? Two recent
   hypotheses addressing this discrepancy offered contradictory
   explanations. Under the sperm dilution hypothesis, selection via sperm
   density in the female reproductive tract favours more but smaller sperm
   in large, but the reverse in small, species. Conversely, the metabolic
   constraint hypothesis maintains that ejaculates respond positively to
   selection in small endothermic animals with high metabolic rates,
   whereas low metabolic rates constrain their evolution in large species.
   Here, we resolve this debate by capitalizing on the substantial
   variation in mammalian body size and reproductive physiology.
   Evolutionary responses shifted from sperm length to number with
   increasing mammalian body size, thus supporting the sperm dilution
   hypothesis. Our findings demonstrate that body-size-mediated trade-offs
   between sperm size and number can explain the extreme diversification in
   sperm phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and continuous monitoring of forest production is critical for
   quantifying the dynamics of regional-to-global carbon cycles. MOD17A2
   provides high frequency observations of terrestrial gross primary
   productivity (GPP) and is widely used to evaluate the spatiotemporal
   variability and responses to changing climate. However, the
   effectiveness of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) in measuring GPP is directly constrained by the large
   uncertainties in the modeling process, specifically for complicated and
   extensive forest ecosystems. Although there have been plenty of studies
   to verify the MODIS GPP product with ground-based measurements covering
   a range of biome types, few have comprehensively validated the
   performance of MODIS estimates (C5.5) for diverse forests. Thus, this
   study examined the degree of correspondence between the MODIS-derived
   GPP and the EC-measured GPP at seasonal and interannual time scales for
   the main forest ecosystems, encompassing evergreen broadleaf forest
   (EBF), evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF), deciduous broadleaf forest
   (DBF), and mixed forest (MF) relying on 16 flux towers with a total
   dataset of 68 site-years. Overall, the site-specific evaluation of
   multi-year mean annual GPP estimates indicates that the current MODIS
   product works more significantly for DBF and MF, less for ENF, and least
   for EBF. Except for the tropical forest, MODIS estimates could capture
   the broad trends of GPP at an 8-day time scale for the other sites. At
   the seasonal time scale, the highest performance was observed in ENF,
   followed by MF and DBF, and the least performance was observed in EBF.
   Trend analyses also revealed the weak performance in EBF and DBF. This
   study suggested that current MODIS GPP estimates still need to improve
   the quality of different upstream inputs in addition to the algorithm
   for accurately quantifying forest production.}},

Abstract = {{For applications in animal movement, we propose a random trajectory
   generator (RTG) algorithm that combines the concepts of random walks,
   space-time prisms, and the Brownian bridge movement model and is capable
   of efficiently generating random trajectories between a given origin and
   a destination point, with the least directional bias possible. Since we
   provide both a planar and a spherical version of the algorithm, it is
   suitable for simulating trajectories ranging from the local scale up to
   the (inter-)continental scale, as exemplified by the movement of
   migrating birds. The algorithm accounts for physical limitations,
   including maximum speed and maximum movement time, and provides the user
   with either single or multiple trajectories as a result. Single
   trajectories generated by the RTG algorithm can be used as a null model
   to test hypotheses about movement stimuli, while the multiple
   trajectories can be used to create a probability density surface akin to
   Brownian bridges.}},

Abstract = {{The present work focuses on cold alpine soils of the Altai Mountains
   (Siberia, Russia). Permafrost is widespread and often occurs at a depth
   of about 100 cm. The area is characterised by extremely cold winters and
   cool summers: the aim was consequently to find out whether weathering
   could be more intense on thermally less unfavoured conditions or whether
   the abundance of water could be a more important factor.
   We investigated 10 soils in a very small area close to a local glacier
   tongue. Five of the investigated soils were south-facing and the other
   five north-facing. The soils have the same parent material (mica-rich
   till), altitude, topography and soil age. The vegetation is alpine
   grassland that is partially intersected with some juniper and mosses.
   Soil chemical properties such as organic C, N, soil organic matter
   quality (using DRIFT), pH value, (oxy)hydroxides, total elemental
   contents (XRF) and soil micromorphology and mineralogy (using diagnostic
   treatments and XRD) were determined. The age constraint of the site was
   given by geomorphic studies together with C-14 dating of a nearby peat
   bog and the stable organic matter fraction of the soils.
   The soils have a Holocene age. The results showed astonishingly
   clearly-similarly to the European Alps-that the north-facing soils have
   a higher weathering state. This is expressed by lower pH values, higher
   oxalate and dithionite extractable Fe, Al, Mn and Si contents, higher C
   and N concentrations and stocks when compared to the south-facing sites.
   No statistically significant differences with respect to weathering
   indexes could be detected.
   The geochemical evolution of the soils seems to be enhanced at
   north-facing sites, even though very severe climatic conditions prevail.
   Furthermore, biodegradation seems to be less pronounced on north-facing
   compared to south-facing sites as poorly degraded organic matter is
   accumulated. This gives rise to more organic ligands that promote metal
   binding and their subsequent eluviation along the soil profile.
   We consequently must assume that weathering is not limited by low
   temperatures in the active layer but is rather controlled by soil
   moisture that seems to be higher during the warmer period in the
   north-facing soils.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of precipitation and its spatial variability is
   crucial for reliable discharge simulations. Although radar and satellite
   based techniques are becoming increasingly widespread, quantitative
   precipitation estimates based on point rain gauge measurement
   interpolation are, and will continue to be in the foreseeable future,
   widely used. However, the ability to infer spatially distributed data
   from point measurements is strongly dependent on the number, location
   and reliability of measurement stations. In this study we quantitatively
   investigated the effect of rain gauge network configurations on the
   spatial interpolation by using the operational hydrometeorological
   sensor network in the Thur river basin in north-eastern Switzerland as a
   test case. Spatial precipitation based on a combination of radar and
   rain gauge data provided by MeteoSwiss was assumed to represent the true
   precipitation values against which the precipitation interpolation from
   the sensor network was evaluated. The performance using scenarios with
   both increased and decreased station density were explored. The
   catchment-average interpolation error indices significantly improve up
   to a density of 24 rain gauges per 1000km(2), beyond which improvements
   were negligible. However, a reduced rain gauge density in the higher
   parts of the catchment resulted in a noticeable decline of the
   performance indices. An evaluation based on precipitation intensity
   thresholds indicated a decreasing performance for higher precipitation
   intensities. The results of this study emphasise the benefits of dense
   and adequately distributed rain gauge networks.}},

Abstract = {{Mass loss of glaciers in the Chinese Altai was detected using geodetic
   methods based on topographical maps (1959), the Shuttle Radar Topography
   Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (2000), and the Advanced
   Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) stereo
   images (2008). The results indicate that a continued and accelerating
   shrinkage has occurred in the Chinese Altai Mountains during the last 50
   years, with mass deficits of 0.43 +/- 0.02 and 0.54 +/- 0.13 m a(-1)
   water equivalent (w.e.) during the periods 1959-1999 and 1999-2008,
   respectively. Overall, the Chinese Altai Mountains have lost 7.06 +/-
   0.44 km(3) in ice volume (equivalent to -0.43 +/- 0.03 m a(-1) w.e.)
   from 1959-2008. The spatial heterogeneity in mass loss was potentially
   affected by comprehensive changes in temperature and precipitation, and
   had a substantial correlation with glacier size and topographic
   settings. Comparison shows that in the Chinese Altai Mountains glaciers
   have experienced a more rapid mass loss than those in the Tianshan and
   northwestern Tibetan Plateau (TP), and the mass balance of glaciers was
   slightly less negative relative to those in the Russian Altai, Himalaya,
   and southern TP.}},

Abstract = {{The early life period is characterized by fast growth and development,
   which can lead to high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Young
   animals thus have to balance their investment in growth versus ROS
   defence, and this balance is likely mediated by resource availability.
   Consequently resources transferred prenatally by the mother and
   nutritional conditions experienced shortly after birth may crucially
   determine the oxidative status of young animals. Here, we experimentally
   investigated the relative importance of pre- and early postnatal
   nutritional conditions on the oxidative status of great tit nestlings
   (Parus major). We show that resources transferred by the mother through
   the egg and nutritional conditions encountered after hatching affect the
   oxidative status of nestling in a sex-specific way. Daughters of
   non-supplemented mothers and daughters which did not receive extra food
   during the early postnatal period had higher oxidative damage than sons,
   while no differences between sons and daughters were found when extra
   food was provided pre- or postnatally. No effect of the food
   supplementations on growth, fledging mass or tarsus length was observed,
   indicating that female nestlings maintained their investment in growth
   at the expense of ROS defence mechanisms when resources were limited.
   The lower priority of the antioxidant defence system for female
   nestlings was also evidenced by lower levels of specific antioxidant
   components. These results highlight the important role of early parental
   effects in shaping oxidative stress in the offspring, and show that the
   sensitivity to these parental effects is sex-specific.}},

Abstract = {{The scarcity of parthenogenetic vertebrates is often attributed to their
   inferior' mode of clonal reproduction, which restricts them to
   self-reproduce their own genotype lineage and leaves little evolutionary
   potential with regard to speciation and evolution of sexual
   reproduction. Here, we show that for some taxa, such uniformity does not
   hold. Using hybridogenetic water frogs (Pelophylax esculentus) as a
   model system, we demonstrate that triploid hybrid males from two
   geographic regions exhibit very different reproductive modes. With an
   integrative data set combining field studies, crossing experiments, flow
   cytometry and microsatellite analyses, we found that triploid hybrids
   from Central Europe are rare, occur in male sex only and form diploid
   gametes of a single clonal lineage. In contrast, triploid hybrids from
   north-western Europe are widespread, occur in both sexes and produce
   recombined haploid gametes. These differences translate into contrasting
   reproductive roles between regions. In Central Europe, triploid hybrid
   males sexually parasitize diploid hybrids and just perpetuate their own
   genotype - which is the usual pattern in parthenogens. In north-western
   Europe, on the other hand, the triploid males are gamete donors for
   diploid hybrids, thereby stabilizing the mixed 2n-3n hybrid populations.
   By demonstrating these contrasting roles in male reproduction, we draw
   attention to a new significant evolutionary potential for animals with
   nonsexual reproduction, namely reproductive plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{The crucial role of reproductive isolation in speciation has long been
   recognized; however, a limited number of studies quantify different
   isolation barriers and embed reproductive isolation in a phylogenetic
   context. In this study, we investigate reproductive isolation between
   the often sympatrically occurring orchid species, Gymnadenia conopsea
   and G. odoratissima. We examine the phylogenetic relationship between
   the two species and analyse floral isolation, fruit set and seed
   viability from interspecies crosses, as well as the ploidy level.
   Additionally, we quantify interspecies differences in floral signals and
   morphology. The results suggest that the two species have a
   sister-species relationship. In terms of reproductive isolation, we
   found complete floral isolation between the two species, but little to
   no post-pollination isolation; the species also mostly had the same
   ploidy level in the studied populations. We also show clear distinctions
   in floral signals, as well as in floral size and spur length. We propose
   that respective adaptation to short- vs. long-tongued pollinators was
   the driver of speciation in the here studied Gymnadenia species. Our
   study supports the key role of floral isolation in orchid speciation and
   shows that floral isolation is not restricted to highly specialized
   pollination systems, but can also occur between species with less
   specialized pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Predator-prey relationships are vital to ecosystem function and there is
   a need for greater predictive understanding of these interactions. We
   develop a geometric foraging model predicting minimum prey size scaling

   habitat dimensionality and biological traits. Our model predicts
   positive predator-prey size relationships on land but negative
   relationships in the sea. To test the model, we compiled data on diets
   of 794 predators (mammals, snakes, sharks and rays). Consistent with
   predictions, both terrestrial endotherm and ectotherm predators have
   significantly positive predator-prey size relationships. Marine
   predators, however, exhibit greater variation. Some of the largest
   predators specialise on small invertebrates while others are large
   vertebrate specialists. Prey-predator mass ratios were generally higher
   for ectothermic than endothermic predators, although dietary patterns
   were similar. Model-based simulations of predator-prey relationships
   were consistent with observed relationships, suggesting that our

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity is extremely widespread in the behaviour,
   morphology and life-history of animals. However, inducible changes in
   the production of defensive chemicals are described mostly in plants and
   surprisingly little is known about similar plasticity in chemical
   defences of animals. Inducible chemical defences may be common in
   animals because many are known to produce toxins, the synthesis of
   toxins is likely to be costly, and there are a few known cases of
   animals adjusting their toxin production to changes in environmental
   conditions. We outline what is known about the occurrence of inducible
   chemical defences in animals and argue that there is immense potential
   for progress in this field. Possible directions include surveying
   diverse taxa to explore how general its occurrence may be and testing
   for selection acting on inducible chemical defences. Data on inducible
   chemical defences would provide insight into life-history tradeoffs by
   enabling novel tests of how time-costs and resource-costs affect
   life-history. If the synthesis of toxic compounds by animals proves
   accessible to manipulation, as it is in plants and fungi, this will open
   the way to refined estimates of the fitness costs of defence, ultimately
   providing a clearer picture of how plasticity evolves and is maintained
   in nature.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a trans-disciplinary research project, a series of surveys
   and interventions were conducted in different arsenic-affected regions
   of rural Bangladesh. Surveys of institutional stakeholders identified
   deep tubewells and piped water systems as the most preferred options,
   and the same preferences were found in household surveys of populations
   at risk. Psychological surveys revealed that these two technologies were
   well-supported by potential users, with self-efficacy and social norms
   being the principal factors driving behavior change. The principal
   drawbacks of deep tubewells are that installation costs are too high for
   most families to own private wells, and that for various
   socio-cultural-religious reasons, people are not willing to walk long
   distances to access communal tubewells. In addition, water sector
   planners have reservations about greater exploitation of the deep
   aquifer, out of concern for current or future geogenic contamination.
   Groundwater models and field studies have shown that in the great
   majority of the affected areas, the risk of arsenic contamination of
   deep groundwater is small; salinity, iron, and manganese are more likely
   to pose problems. These constituents can in some cases be avoided by
   exploiting an intermediate depth aquifer of good chemical quality, which
   is hydraulically and geo-chemically separate from the
   arsenic-contaminated shallow aquifer. Deep tubewells represent a
   technically sound option throughout much of the arsenic-affected
   regions, and future mitigation programs should build on and accelerate
   construction of deep tubewells. Utilization of deep tubewells, however,
   could be improved by increasing the tubewell density (which requires
   stronger financial support) to reduce travel times, by considering water
   quality in a holistic way, and by accompanying tubewell installation
   with motivational interventions based on psychological factors. By
   combining findings from technical and social sciences, the efficiency
   and success of arsenic mitigation in general - and installation of deep
   tubewells in particular - can be significantly enhanced. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Drawing on the idea that biodiversity is simply the diversity of living
   things, and that everyone knows what diversity and living things mean,
   most conservation professionals eschew the need to explain the many
   complex ways in which biodiversity is understood in science. On many
   biodiversity-related issues, this lack of clarity leads to a
   communication gap between science and the general public, including
   decision makers who must design and implement biodiversity policies.
   Closing this communication gap is pivotal to the ability of science to
   inform sound environmental decision making. To address this
   communication gap, we propose a surrogate of biodiversity for
   communication purposes that captures the scientific definition of
   biodiversity yet can be understood by nonscientists; that is,
   biodiversity as a learning experience. The prerequisites of this or any
   other biodiversity communication surrogate are that it should have
   transdisciplinary relevance; not be measurable; be accessible to a wide
   audience; be usable to translate biodiversity issues; and understandably
   encompass biodiversity concepts. Biodiversity as a learning experience
   satisfies these prerequisites and is philosophically robust. More
   importantly, it can effectively contribute to closing the communication
   gap between biodiversity science and society at large. Experimentando la
   Biodiversidad como un Puente sobre el Vacio entre la Comunicacion
   Ciencia-Sociedad
   Resumen Partiendo de la idea que la biodiversidad es simplemente la
   diversidad de seres vivos y que todos saben lo que significan diversidad
   y seres vivos, la mayoria de los profesionales de la conservacion evitan
   la necesidad de explicar las diferentes formas complejas en las cuales
   la biodiversidad se entiende dentro de la ciencia. En muchos temas
   relacionados con la biodiversidad, esta falta de claridad lleva a un
   vacio en la comunicacion entre la ciencia y el publico en general,
   incluyendo a quienes toman las decisiones y deben disenar e implementar
   politicas de biodiversidad. Disminuir este vacio es esencial en la
   habilidad de la ciencia para informar la toma de decisiones ambientales.
   Para tratar este vacio proponemos un sustituto de la biodiversidad para
   propositos de comunicacion que capture la definicion cientifica de
   biodiversidad y pueda ser entendido por no-cientificos; esto quiere
   decir que la biodiversidad es una experiencia de aprendizaje. Los
   prerrequisitos de esto, o cualquier otro sustituto de la comunicacion,
   son que debe tener relevancia transdisciplinaria, no ser medible, ser
   accesible a un publico amplio, ser util para traducir temer de
   biodiversidad y ser entendible para englobar conceptos de biodiversidad.
   La biodiversidad como una experiencia de aprendizaje satisface estos
   prerrequisitos y es filosoficamente robusta. Mas importante, puede
   contribuir efectivamente al cierre del vacio en la comunicacion entre la
   ciencia de la biodiversidad y la sociedad en general.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular methods of assessing dispersal have become increasingly
   powerful and have superseded direct methods of studying dispersal.
   Although now less popular, direct methods of studying dispersal remain
   important tools for understanding the evolution of dispersal. Here, we
   use data from Siberian jays Perisoreus infaustus, a group-living bird
   species, to compare natal dispersal distances and rates using visual
   mark-recapture, radio-tracking and microsatellite data. Siberian jays
   have bimodal natal dispersal timing; socially dominant offspring remain
   with their parents for up to 5 years (delayed dispersers), while they
   force their subordinate brood mates to leave the parental territory at
   independence (early dispersers). Early dispersers moved about 9,000 m
   (visual mark-recapture, radio-tracking) before settling in a group as a
   non-breeder. In contrast, delayed dispersers moved about 1,250 m (visual
   mark-recapture only) and mainly moved to a breeding opening. Dispersal
   distances were greater in managed habitat compared to natural habitat
   for both early and delayed dispersers. Molecular estimates based on 23
   microsatellite loci and geographical locations supported distance
   estimates from the direct methods. Our study shows that molecular
   methods are at least 22 times cheaper than direct methods and match
   estimates of dispersal distance from direct methods. However, molecular
   estimates do not give insight into the behavioural mechanisms behind
   dispersal decisions. Thus, to understand the evolution of dispersal, it
   is important to combine direct and indirect methods, which will give
   insights into the behavioural processes affecting dispersal decisions,
   allowing proximate dispersal decisions to be linked to the ultimate
   consequences thereof.}},

Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{Soil moisture affects belowground activity in grasslands, but the
   effects of summer drought on different soil C fluxes is uncertain. Soil
   respiration (SR), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leaching and their
   components may all respond differently and drought effects will interact
   with other factors such as temperature, making a priori predictions of
   soil C balances difficult. In this study, we used rain shelters to
   simulate summer droughts by reducing annual precipitation by around 30
   \% in three managed grassland sites at 400, 1,000 and 2,000 m a.s.l. in
   Switzerland covering a gradient in mean annual temperatures of 7.5 A
   degrees C. During the growing season, we quantified the impacts of
   drought on SR, DOC leaching, litter decomposition and the contribution
   of C-13-depleted litter to DOC fluxes. Along the elevational gradient,
   SR rates did not decrease with increasing altitude. Thus, SR was higher
   at a given temperature at higher altitudes, which probably reflects more
   labile soil C and hence greater substrate availability in a colder
   climate. Fluxes of DOC at 5 cm depth were a magnitude smaller than SR
   and did not show a pattern with elevation. At all altitudes, the
   experimental summer drought significantly reduced SR rates by 25-57 \%
   and DOC leaching by 80-100 \%, with a declining contribution of
   C-13-depleted litter-DOC. The remaining litter mass after drought was
   two to seven times larger as compared to the control. We did not observe
   a strong C release upon rewetting and hence, there was no compensation
   for the reduced soil C fluxes during drought. The more sensitive drought
   response in the litter layer than in the deeper soil and the declining
   DOC fluxes indicate an altered soil C balance with a C preservation in
   the topsoil, but ongoing losses of probably `older' C in subsoils under
   drought.}},

Title = {{FLORAL STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT IN RAFFLESIACEAE WITH EMPHASIS ON THEIR

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{225-243}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: The holoparasitic plant family Rafflesiaceae
   include the world's largest flowers. Despite their iconic status,
   relatively little is known about the morphology and development of their
   flowers. A recent study clarified the organization of the outer
   (sterile) floral organs, surprisingly revealing that their distinctive
   floral chambers arose via different developmental pathways in the two
   major genera of the family. Here, we expand that research to investigate
   the structure and development of the reproductive organs of
   Rafflesiaceae.
   Methods: Serial sectioning, scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray
   tomography of floral buds were employed to reconstruct the structure and
   development of all three Rafflesiaceae genera.
   Key results: Unlike most angiosperms, which form their shoot apex from
   the primary morphological surface, the shoot apex of Rafflesiaceae
   instead forms secondarily via internal cell separation (schizogeny)
   along the distal boundary of the host-parasite interface. Similarly, the
   radially directed ovarial clefts of the gynoecium forms via schizogeny
   within solid tissue, and no carpels are initiated from the floral apex.
   Conclusions: The development of the shoot apex and gynoecium of
   Rafflesiaceae are highly unusual. Although secondary formation of the
   morphological surface from the shoot apex has been documented in other
   plant groups, secondary derivation of the inner gynoecium surface is
   otherwise unknown. Both features are likely synapomorphies of
   Rafflesiaceae. The secondary derivation of the shoot apex may protect
   the developing floral shoot as it emerges from within dense host tissue.
   The secondary formation of the ovarial clefts may generate the extensive
   placental area necessary to produce hundreds of thousands of ovules.}},

Abstract = {{A range of chemicals found in the aquatic environment have the potential
   to influence endocrine function and affect sexual development by
   mimicking or antagonizing the effects of hormones, or by altering the
   synthesis and metabolism of hormones. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate whether the effects of chemicals interfering with sex hormone
   synthesis may affect the regulation of early ovarian development via the
   modulation of sex steroid and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) systems.
   To this end, ex vivo ovary cultures of juvenile brown trout (Salmo
   trutta fario) were exposed for 2 days to either
   1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (ATD, a specific aromatase inhibitor),
   prochloraz (an imidazole fungicide), or tributyltin (TBT, a persistent
   organic pollutant). Further, juvenile female brown trout were exposed in
   vivo for 2 days to prochloraz or TBT. The ex vivo and in vivo ovarian
   gene expression of the aromatase (CYP19), responsible for estrogen
   production, and of IGF1 and 2 were compared. Moreover, 17-estradiol (E2)
   and testosterone (T) production from ex vivo ovary cultures was
   assessed. Ex vivo exposure to ATD inhibited ovarian E2 synthesis, while
   T levels accumulated. However, ATD did not affect ex vivo expression of
   cyp19, igf1, or igf2. Ex vivo exposure to prochloraz inhibited ovarian
   E2 production, but did not affect T levels. Further prochloraz
   up-regulated igf1 expression in both ex vivo and in vivo exposures. TBT
   exposure did not modify ex vivo synthesis of either E2 or T. However, in
   vivo exposure to TBT down-regulated igf2 expression. The results
   indicate that ovarian inhibition of E2 production in juvenile brown
   trout might not directly affect cyp19 and igf gene expression. Thus, we
   suggest that the test chemicals may interfere with both sex steroid and
   IGF systems in an independent manner, and based on published literature,
   potentially lead to endocrine dysfunction and altered sexual
   development. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 29:

Abstract = {{The distribution of concentration of cosmogenic nuclides in fault scarps
   is used to determine slip histories. The complicated part is the
   calculation of cosmic radiation shielding by the escarpment body and the
   overlying wedge of the colluvial sediment. To improve reconstruction of
   earthquake ages and slip histories, we developed a mathematical model
   and corresponding MATLAB(R) code for computation of shielding factor
   profiles in fault scarp geometry. In the model, cosmic radiation
   received by a point of footwall is represented as unit rays attenuated
   exponentially in scarp geometry. This approach allows producing very
   precise results both for the fault scarp and the sloped surface. The
   code is presented as a m-function and as a stand-alone program with a
   user-friendly interface. Shielding factors are calculated by the code
   for fast neutrons or for muons and include all general shieldings:
   topographical, sloped surface, fault scarp surface, colluvium cover,
   snow cover and self-shielding. A variety of input parameters enables one
   to adjust the model and the code to almost all possible shielding cases.
   The code and stand-alone version are provided as supplementary materials
   and equipped with help and explanatory notes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Genomic effects on advertisement call structure in diploid and triploid
   hybrid waterfrogs (Anura, Pelophylax esculentus)}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: In anurans, differences in male mating calls have
   intensively been studied with respect to taxonomic classification,
   phylogeographic comparisons among different populations and sexual
   selection. Although overall successful, there is often much unexplained
   variation in these studies. Potential causes for such variation include
   differences among genotypes and breeding systems, as well as differences
   between populations. We investigated how these three factors affect call
   properties in male water frogs of Pelophylax lessonae (genotype LL), P.
   ridibundus (RR) and their interspecific hybrid P. esculentus which comes
   in diploid (LR) and triploid types (LLR, LRR).
   Results: We investigated five call parameters that all showed a genomic
   dosage effect, i.e. they either decreased or increased with the L/R
   ratio in the order LL-LLR-LR-LRR-RR. Not all parameters differentiated
   equally well between the five genotypes, but combined they provided a
   good separation. Two of the five call parameters were also affected by
   the breeding system. Calls of diploid LR males varied, depending on
   whether these males mated with one or both of the parental species
   (diploid systems) or triploid hybrids (mixed ploidy systems). With the
   exception of the northernmost mixed-ploidy population, call differences
   were not related to the geographic location of the population and they
   were not correlated with genetic distances in the R and L genomes.
   Conclusions: We found an influence of all three tested factors on call
   parameters, with the effect size decreasing from genotype through
   breeding system to geographic location of the population. Overall,
   results were in line with predictions from a dosage effect in L/R
   ratios, but in three call parameters all three hybrid types were more
   similar to one or the other parental species. Also calls of diploid
   hybrids varied between breeding systems in agreement with the sexual
   host required for successful reproduction. The lack of hybrid call
   differences in a mixed-ploidy population at the northern edge of the
   water frog distribution is likely to be associated with genetic
   particularities, including a) low genetic variability and/or b) a local
   loss of genes coding for genotype-dependent call differentiation under
   conditions where female discrimination between diploid and triploid
   males is not beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{Several plant species of the genus Psychotria (Rubiaceae) harbor
   Burkholderia sp. bacteria within specialized leaf nodules. The bacteria
   are transmitted vertically between plant generations and have not yet
   been cultured outside of their host. This symbiosis is considered to be
   obligatory because plants devoid of symbionts fail to develop into
   mature individuals. The genome of `Candidatus Burkholderia kirkii' has
   been sequenced recently and has revealed evidence of reductive genome
   evolution, as shown by the proliferation of insertion sequences and the
   presence of numerous pseudogenes. We employed shotgun proteomics to
   investigate the expression of `Ca. B. kirkii' proteins in the leaf
   nodule. Drawing from this dataset and refined comparative genomics
   analyses, we designed a new pseudogene prediction algorithm and improved
   the genome annotation. We also found conclusive evidence that nodule
   bacteria allocate vast resources to synthesis of secondary metabolites,
   possibly of the C7N aminocyclitol family. Expression of a putative
   2-epi-5-valiolone synthase, a key enzyme of the C7N aminocyclitol
   synthesis, is high in the nodule population but downregulated in
   bacteria residing in the shoot apex, suggesting that production of
   secondary metabolites is particularly important in the leaf nodule.}},

Abstract = {{The extinction of a species is an event that often captures the public's
   imagination. Indeed, declaring a species as extinct is typically though
   of as a way of raising awareness of the impacts humanity is having on
   the global biosphere. However, thus far there is little evidence to
   suggest whether declaring a species as extinct leads to increased public
   concern, and whether this concern may in turn lead to support to slow
   future biodiversity loss. To assess this, I look to see whether there is
   any increase in the number of donations made to a large conservation
   charity after five recent, well-publicised extinction events that have
   generated public interest. I find that peaks in public interest in a
   species that has been reported as extinct may correspond to an increase
   in the number of donations made, but that other conservation related
   events may also affect month-month variation in the number of pledges
   made.}},

   species, total planting density was 1,000 or 2,000 seeds/m(2), and
   species were sown in even or uneven proportions, where one functional
   group was made dominant. Aboveground plant biomass increased linearly
   with the logarithm of species richness in all density and evenness
   treatments during all three years of the experiment. This was due to a
   convergence of realized density and evenness within species richness
   levels, although functional groups which were initially made dominant
   retained their dominance. Between species richness levels, realized
   density increased, and realized evenness decreased with species
   richness. Thus, more individuals could coexist if they belonged to
   different species. Within species richness levels, higher biomass values
   were correlated with lower density, suggesting an underlying thinning
   process. However, communities with low realized evenness also had low
   biomass values; thus high biomass did not result from species dominance.
   So-called complementarity and selection effects were similar across
   density and evenness treatments, indicating that the mechanisms
   underpinning the biodiversity effects were not altered. Species richness
   was the dominant driver of aboveground biomass, irrespective of
   variations in total densities and species abundance distributions at the
   start of the experiment; rejecting the hypothesis that initial
   differences in species abundance distributions might lead to different
   ``stable states{''} in community structure or biomass. Thus, results
   from previous biodiversity experiments that only manipulated species
   richness and composition should be quite robust and broadly
   generalizable.}},

Abstract = {{Summer pastures in the Swiss Alps are currently affected by land-use
   changes that cause a decrease in biodiversity. Although these habitats
   make up one-third of the whole Swiss agricultural area, direct payments
   dedicated to support their management are very low. Current political
   instruments do not support efforts to conserve the biodiversity in these
   areas, but a vegetation-based approach such as the one implemented in
   the permanently utilized agricultural areas is under discussion.
   However, available studies evaluating the surrogate value of vascular
   plants for other (particularly animal) taxa have yielded inconsistent
   results, and very few have been conducted in habitats at high
   elevations. We investigated the extent to which vascular plants are
   adequate surrogates for butterfly and grasshopper diversity, examining
   the congruence of species richness and community similarity in two
   heterogeneous subalpine pastures in the Swiss Alps. Results at the
   species richness level (Spearman's rank correlation) varied widely
   according to the study site and taxa assessed. In contrast, at the
   community similarity level (Procrustean randomization tests with
   Bray-Curtis similarity), congruencies between vascular plant and
   invertebrate taxa were generally highly significant. We therefore
   recommend the use of community similarity as a basis for estimating
   biodiversity patterns. Our results suggest that conservation measures
   aimed primarily at enhancing the floristic diversity of subalpine
   grasslands are also likely to benefit butterfly and grasshopper
   diversity, at least at the local scale.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers of extant Quintinia are described in detail on the basis of
   field observations and serial microtome sections and compared with
   flowers of the Late Cretaceous Silvianthemum suecicum and Bertilanthus

   analyses of both extant and fossil material also include
   synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy. The study shows that
   Quintinia and Silvianthemum/Bertilanthus have more features in common
   than previously recognized and strongly reinforces their earlier assumed
   close relationships. Among important characters linking the three genera
   are similar secretory hairs on the floral surface and pedicel; short
   sepals; free, quincuncial petals; broad anthers with small pollen sacs;
   4-aperturate pollen (in Silvianthemum and Quintinia); postgenital union
   of the 3-4 apocarpous styles (in Silvianthemum and Quintinia);
   connection of the apocarpous carpel parts with the floral base; downward
   tapering ovary and locule(s); placentation on incomplete septa; and
   flask-shaped epidermal cells with a thin and long papilla on the
   carpels. Features observed in Quintinia, particularly the presence of
   bitegmic ovules and free petals, suggest that the apparent phylogenetic
   position with extant Paracryphiales (campanulids) needs further
   analysis. Bitegmic ovules are not known from other Paracryphiales or
   campanulids, and the presence of free petals is unusual in campanulids.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies of plant stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition
   have revealed relationships with temperature and precipitation. These
   relationships conform to theoretical predictions of how extrinsic
   factors impact on ecophysiological processes such as photosynthesis and
   nitrogen cycling. However, examination of many datasets reveals high
   levels of variation, especially across environments with moderate
   precipitation (<1000mm a1). To test for extrinsic effects on plant
   isotope composition in such environments, we studied data from plants
   collected over three years from multiple habitats and seasons in Kruger
   National Park, South Africa. Our sample is sufficiently large to
   evaluate not only effects of environmental variables (rainfall up to
   approximate to 800mm a1, temperature, physical habitat structure) but
   also taxonomic effects. Species composition of habitats accounted for
   most of the variation in our data, followed by physical habitat
   structure (e.g. wooded or riverine compared with open, grassy habitats),
   while rainfall and temperature had only indirect or negligible effects.
   The latter finding concurs with subsections of existing datasets and we
   suggest therefore that such effects usually become visible in datasets
   that span environmental extremes, implying environmental ranges within
   which plant isotope variations cannot readily be ascribed to climate.

Abstract = {{The evolutionary potential and ecological importance of interspecific
   hybrids continues to be a controversial issue. Traditionally,
   hybridization often associated with polyploidy and clonal reproduction
   was considered an important mechanism for speciation in plants, but not
   in animals. More recently, investigations have shifted to the question:
   Under which genetic and ecological conditions do hybrid taxa and
   different ploidies arise and succeed, and when and where do they fail?
   Finding answers to this question is aggravated by the fact that suitable
   taxa for such studies are often far apart on the phylogenetic tree.
   Hence, results are influenced by many confounding variables. In this
   study, we reduce this problem by investigating the fitness within a
   complex of three closely related water frog taxa consisting of the two
   sexually reproducing parental species Pelophylax lessonae (genotype LL)
   and P.ridibundus (RR) plus their interspecific hybrid P.esculentus which
   comes in three ploidy types (LR, LLR and LRR), as well as with sexual
   and hemiclonal reproduction. Offspring of all five genotypes were
   produced by artificially crossing adults sampled from populations in
   Slovakia, Germany and Switzerland. This created genetic variation. They
   were then raised at two temperature levels: 18 and 24 degrees C. This
   created ecological variation. Larval performance under the two
   temperature regimes was analysed with respect to three fitness-related
   parameters: survival rate, days to metamorphosis and weight at tail
   resorption. Survival rate was significantly higher for offspring of the
   three hybrid types (LR, LLR and LRR) compared with those of the parental
   species (LL, RR), at both rearing temperatures. For days to
   metamorphosis and weight at metamorphosis, we found an interaction
   between offspring type and temperature. In both cases, performance of
   hybrid and parental offspring did not differ at 24 degrees C, but at 18
   degrees C hybrids metamorphosed faster and at a lower weight than
   parentals. We discuss these results in relation to those from other
   studies and conclude that under cold conditions hybrids (especially the
   two triploid types) have higher fitness than both parental species. This
   genotypexenvironment interaction could be one reason why all-hybrid
   populations mainly occur at the cooler northern range of the water frog
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Monographs are fundamental for progress in systematic botany. They are
   the vehicles for circumscribing and naming taxa, determining
   distributions and ecology, assessing relationships for formal
   classification, and interpreting long-term and short-term dimensions of
   the evolutionary process. Despite their importance, fewer monographs are
   now being prepared by the newer generation of systematic botanists, who
   are understandably involved principally with DNA data and analysis,
   especially for answering phylogenetic, biogeographic, and population
   genetic questions. As monographs provide hypotheses regarding species
   boundaries and plant relationships, new insights in many plant groups
   are urgently needed. Increasing pressures on biodiversity, especially in
   tropical and developing regions of the world, emphasize this point. The
   results from a workshop (with 21 participants) reaffirm the central role
   that monographs play in systematic botany. But, rather than advocating
   abbreviated models for monographic products, we recommend a full
   presentation of relevant information. Electronic publication offers
   numerous means of illustration of taxa, habitats, characters, and
   statistical and phylogenetic analyses, which previously would have been
   prohibitively costly. Open Access and semantically enhanced linked
   electronic publications provide instant access to content from anywhere
   in the world, and at the same time link this content to all underlying
   data and digital resources used in the work. Resources in support of
   monography, especially databases and widely and easily accessible
   digital literature and specimens, are now more powerful than ever
   before, but interfacing and interoperability of databases are much
   needed. Priorities for new resources to be developed include an index of
   type collections and an online global chromosome database. Funding for
   sabbaticals for monographers to work uninterrupted on major projects is
   strongly encouraged. We recommend that doctoral students be assigned
   smaller genera, or natural portions of larger ones (subgenera, sections,
   etc.), to gain the necessary expertise for producing a monograph,
   including training in a broad array of data collection (e.g.,
   morphology, anatomy, palynology, cytogenetics, DNA techniques, ecology,
   biogeography), data analysis (e.g., statistics, phylogenetics, models),
   and nomenclature. Training programs, supported by institutes,
   associations, and agencies, provide means for passing on procedures and
   perspectives of challenging botanical monography to the next generation
   of young systematists.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{92-100}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Many resistance genes against fungal pathogens show costs of resistance.
   Genetically modified (GM) plants that differ in only one or a few
   resistance genes from control plants present ideal systems for measuring
   these costs in the absence of pathogens.
   To assess the ecological relevance of costs of pathogen resistance, we
   grew individual plants of four transgenic spring wheat lines in a field
   trial with three pathogen levels and varied the genetic diversity of the
   crop.
   We found that two lines with a Pm3b transgene were more resistant to
   powdery mildew than their sister lines of the variety Bobwhite, whereas
   lines with chitinase (A9) or chitinase and glucanase (A13) transgenes
   were not more resistant than their mother variety Frisal. Nevertheless,
   in the absence of the pathogen, both the GM lines of Bobwhite as well as
   those of Frisal performed significantly worse than their controls, i.e.
   Pm3b\#1 and Pm3b\#2 had 39\% or 53\% and A9 and A13 had 14\% or 23\%
   lower yields. In the presence of the pathogen, all GM lines except
   Pm3b\#2 could increase their yields and other fitness-related traits,
   reaching the performance levels of the control lines. Line Pm3b\#2
   seemed to have lost its phenotypic plasticity and had low performance in
   all environments. This may have been caused by very high transgene
   expression. No synergistic effects of mixing different GM lines with
   each other were detected. This might have been due to high transgene
   expression or the similarity between the lines regarding their
   resistance genes.
   We conclude that costs of resistance can be high for transgenic plants
   with constitutive transgene expression and that this can occur even in
   cases where the non-transgenic control lines are already relatively
   resistant, such as in our variety Frisal. Transgenic plants could only
   compete with conventional varieties in environments with high pathogen
   pressure. Furthermore, the large variability among the GM lines, which
   may be due to unpredictable transgene expression, suggests that
   case-by-case assessments are necessary to evaluate costs of resistance.}},

Title = {{Black carbon contributes to organic matter in young soils in the
   Morteratsch proglacial area (Switzerland)}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1265-1274}},
Abstract = {{Most glacier forefields of the European Alps are being progressively
   exposed since the glaciers reached their maximum expansion in the 1850s.
   Global warming and climate changes additionally promote the exposure of
   sediments in previously glaciated areas. In these proglacial areas,
   initial soils have started to develop so that they may offer a
   continuous chronosequence from 0 to 150-yr-old soils.
   The build-up of organic matter is an important factor of soil formation,
   and not only autochthonous but also distant sources might contribute to
   its accumulation in young soils and surfaces of glacier forefields. Only
   little is known about black carbon in soils that develop in glacier
   forefields, although charred organic matter could be an important
   component of organic carbon in Alpine soils.
   The aim of our study was to examine whether black carbon (BC) is present
   in the initial soils of a proglacial area, and to estimate its relative
   contribution to soil organic matter. We investigated soil samples from
   35 sites distributed over the whole proglacial area of Morteratsch
   (Upper Engadine, Switzerland), covering a chronosequence from 0 to 150
   yr. BC concentrations were determined in fine earth using the benzene
   polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) marker method. We found that charred organic
   matter occurred in the whole area, and that it was a main compound of
   soil organic matter in the youngest soils, where total C-org
   concentrations were very low. The absolute concentrations of BC in fine
   earth were generally low but increased in soils that had been exposed
   for more than 40 yr. Specific initial microbial communities may profit
   from this additional C source during the first years of soil evolution
   and potentially promote soil development in its early stage.}},

Title = {{The genus Lycium as food and medicine: A botanical, ethnobotanical and
   historical review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{212}},
Pages = {{50-66}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Lycium is widely distributed in the arid
   to semi-arid environments of North and South America, Africa, and
   Eurasia. In recent years, Lycium barbarum and L. chinense have been
   advertised as ``superfood{''} with healthy properties. Despite of its
   popularity, there is a lack of an integrated and critical appraisal of
   the existing evidence for the use of Lycium.
   Aim of the study: There is a need to understand: 1) Which species were
   used and how the uses of Lycium developed spatially and over time, 2)
   how uses differ among regions with different culture backgrounds, and 3)
   how traditional and current therapeutic and preventive health claims
   correlate with pharmacological findings.
   Methods: Information was retrieved from floras, taxonomic, botanical,
   and ethnobotanical databases, research articles, recent editions of
   historical Chinese herbals over the last 2000 years, and pharmacopoeias.
   Results: Of totally 97 species, 31 have recorded uses as food and/or
   medicine worldwide. Usually the fruits are used. While 85\% of the
   Lycium species occur in the Americas and Africa, 26\% of them are used,
   but 9 out of 14 species in Eurasia. In China, seven species and two
   varieties of the genus Lycium occur, of which four species have been
   used by different ethnic groups. Only L. barbarum and L. chinense have
   been transformed into globally traded commodities. In China, based on
   the name, their use can be traced back over the last two millennia.
   Lycium fruits for anti-aging, improving eyesight and nourishment were
   documented already in 500 C.E. (Mingyi Bielu). Recent findings explain
   the pharmacological foundations of the traditional uses. Especially
   polysaccharides, zeaxanthin dipalmitate, vitamins, betaine, and mixed
   extracts were reported to be responsible for anti-aging, improving
   eyesight, and anti-fatigue effects.
   Conclusions: The integration of historical, ethnobotanical, botanical,
   phytochemical and pharmacological data has enabled a detailed
   understanding of Lycium and its wider potential. It highlights that the
   focus so far has only been on two species and that the genus can
   potentially yield a wide range of other products with different
   properties.}},

Title = {{Predicting the environmental impact of a future nanocellulose production
   at industrial scale: Application of the life cycle assessment scale-up
   framework}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{283-295}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of lab-scale processes come with
   certain limitations as they are not reflecting e.g. higher efficiencies
   of large-scale production. To address this, we developed in an earlier
   manuscript a scale-up framework for chemical processes which is applied
   in this paper here. Following the framework's five-step procedure on the
   case of a new nanocellulose production pathway, a scaled-up LCA study
   for a future production of nanocellulose is performed. The comparison of
   these LCA results with competing and already commercially produced
   materials as well as with the lab-scale process demonstrates the
   usefulness of the whole scale-up procedure. The example shows that the
   environmental impact per kg of produced nanocellulose yarn can be
   lowered by a factor of up to 6.5 compared to the laboratory production,
   reflecting a projected impact that is closer to the values of an actual
   production plant in case the material will be commercialized. Our
   results got also better comparable to those of competing materials,
   showing values that are up to three times smaller than for carbon
   fibers. Looking into the process, the chosen example of nanocellulose
   shows a considerable change concerning the relative contributions of the
   various process steps. While in the lab scale, the enzymatic treatment
   step - which involved heating for an extended period - was the dominant
   contributor, this step proved to be negligible in terms of environmental
   impact at industrial-scale production given that a more efficient and
   well-insulated reactor is used. The identification of such changes is a
   major added value of the applied scale-up framework which cannot be
   achieved with scale-up procedures using a simple, global scaling factor.
   One of the main purposes of the whole scale-up at such an early stage is
   to give improvement recommendations. The framework can be considered as
   being an effective support for eco-design purposes, helping in
   identifying hotspots for process improvements. It gives a better
   understanding of the process and shows the practical scalability of the
   various steps. Overall, it can assist in steering the research of new
   chemicals and materials more towards an industrial application. (C) 2017

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{4-17}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The evolution of sperm quality and quantity is shaped by various
   selective processes, with sperm competition generally considered the
   primary selective agent. Particularly in external fertilizers, however,
   sperm limitation through gamete dispersal can also influence gamete
   investments, but empirical data examining this effect are limited. Here,
   we studied the relative importance of sperm competition and the spawning
   conditions in explaining the macroevolutionary patterns of sperm size
   and number within two taxa with external fertilization but differences
   in their reproductive biology. In frogs, sperm swim slowly but for up to
   hours as they penetrate the gelatinous egg coating, whereas fish sperm
   typically swim fast, are very short-lived (seconds to minutes), and
   often face a relatively higher risk of being moved away from the ova by
   currents. Our phylogenetic models and path analyses revealed different
   trajectories of ejaculate evolution in these two taxa. Sperm size and
   number responded primarily to variation in sperm competition in the
   anurans, but more strongly to egg number and water turbulence in the
   fishes. Whereas the results across anurans align with the general
   expectation that sexual selection is the main driver of ejaculate
   evolution, our findings across the fishes suggest that sperm limitation
   has been underappreciated.}},

Abstract = {{Armillaria species are both devastating forest pathogens and some of the
   largest terrestrial organisms on Earth. They forage for hosts and
   achieve immense colony sizes via rhizomorphs, root-like multicellular
   structures of clonal dispersal. Here, we sequenced and analysed the
   genomes of four Armillaria species and performed RNA sequencing and
   quantitative proteomic analysis on the invasive and reproductive
   developmental stages of A. ostoyae. Comparison with 22 related fungi
   revealed a significant genome expansion in Armillaria, affecting several
   pathogenicity-related genes, lignocellulose-degrading enzymes and
   lineage-specific genes expressed during rhizomorph development.
   Rhizomorphs express an evolutionarily young transcriptome that shares
   features with the transcriptomes of both fruiting bodies and vegetative
   mycelia. Several genes show concomitant upregulation in rhizomorphs and
   fruiting bodies and share cis-regulatory signatures in their promoters,
   providing genetic and regulatory insights into complex multicellularity
   in fungi. Our results suggest that the evolution of the unique dispersal
   and pathogenicity mechanisms of Armillaria might have drawn upon
   ancestral genetic toolkits for wood-decay, morphogenesis and complex
   multicellularity.}},

Abstract = {{We computed circum-Arctic surface velocity maps of glaciers and ice caps
   over the Canadian Arctic, Svalbard and the Russian Arctic for at least
   two times between the 1990s and 2017 using satellite SAR data. Our
   analyses are mainly performed with offset-tracking of ALOS-1 PALSAR-1
   (2007-2011) and Sentinel-1 (2015-2017) data. In certain cases JERS-1 SAR
   (1994-1998), TerraSAR-X (2008-2012), Radarsat-2 (2009-2016) and ALOS-2
   PALSAR-2 (2015-2016) data were used to fill-in spatial or temporal gaps.
   Validation of the latest Sentinel-1 results was accomplished by means of
   SAR data at higher spatial resolution (Radarsat-2 Wide Ultra Fine) and
   ground-based measurements. In general, we observe a deceleration of flow
   velocities for the major tidewater glaciers in the Canadian Arctic and
   an increase in frontal velocity along with a retreat of frontal
   positions over Svalbard and the Russian Arctic. However, all regions
   have strong accelerations for selected glaciers. The latter developments
   can be well traced based on the very high temporal sampling of
   Sentinel-1 acquisitions since 2015, revealing new insights in glacier
   dynamics. For example, surges on Spitsbergen (e.g., Negribreen,
   Nathorsbreen, Penckbreen and Strongbreen) have a different
   characteristic and timing than those over Eastern Austfonna and Edgeoya
   (e.g., Basin 3, Basin 2 and Stonebreen). Events similar to those ongoing
   on Eastern Austofonna were also observed over the Vavilov Ice Cap on
   Severnaya Zemlya and possibly Simony Glacier on Franz-Josef Land.
   Collectively, there seems to be a recently increasing number of glaciers
   with frontal destabilization over Eastern Svalbard and the Russian
   Arctic compared to the 1990s.}},

Abstract = {{The classical quorum-sensing (QS) model is based on the assumption that
   diffusible signaling molecules accumulate in the culture medium until
   they reach a critical concentration upon which expression of target
   genes is triggered. Here we demonstrate that the hydrophobic signal
   N-hexadecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone, which is produced by Paracoccus
   sp., is released from cells by the aid of membrane vesicles (MVs).
   Packed into MVs, the signal is not only solubilized in an aqueous
   environment but is also delivered with varying propensities to different
   bacteria. We propose a novel MV-based mechanism for binary trafficking
   of hydrophobic signal molecules, which may be particularly relevant for
   bacteria that live in open aqueous environments.}},

Abstract = {{A striking feature of the angiosperms that use animals as pollen

   These traits are underpinned by the synthesis of secondary metabolites

   acids, which are used by plants to lure and reward animal pollinators.
   We review here the knowledge of the metabolic network that supports the
   biosynthesis of these compounds and the behavioral responses that these
   molecules elicit in the animal pollinators. Such knowledge provides us
   with a deeper insight into the ecology and evolution of plant pollinator
   interactions, and should help us to better manage these ecologically

Abstract = {{Accelerated discharge through marine-terminating outlet glaciers has
   been a key component of the rapid mass loss from Arctic glaciers since
   the 1990s. However, glacier retreat and its climatic controls have not
   been assessed at the pan-Arctic scale. Consequently, the spatial and
   temporal variability in the magnitude of retreat, and the possible
   drivers are uncertain. Here we use remotely sensed data acquired over
   273 outlet glaciers, located across the entire Atlantic Arctic (i.e.
   areas potentially influenced by North Atlantic climate and/or ocean
   conditions, specifically: Greenland, Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land and
   Svalbard), to demonstrate high-magnitude, accelerating and
   near-ubiquitous retreat between 1992 and 2010. Overall, mean retreat
   rates increased by a factor of 3.5 between 1992 and 2000 (-30.5 m a(-1))
   and 2000-10 (-105.8 m a(-1)), with 97\% of the study glaciers retreating
   during the latter period. The Retreat was greatest in northern, western
   and south-eastern Greenland and also increased substantially on the
   Barents Sea coast of Novaya Zemlya. Glacier retreat showed no
   significant or consistent relationship with summer air temperatures at
   decadal timescales. The rate of frontal position change showed a
   significant, but weak, correlation with changes in sea-ice
   concentrations. We highlight large variations in retreat rates within
   regions and suggest that fjord topography plays an important role. We
   conclude that marine-terminating Arctic outlet glaciers show a common
   response of rapid and accelerating retreat at decadal timescales.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Globally, the geographical distributions of species are dynamic and
   strongly influenced by dispersal. At the same time, range dynamics feed
   back and may select for increased dispersal at expanding range fronts.
   This interplay between macroecological and evolutionary dynamics happens
   almost universally across environmental gradients and such gradients can
   have a direct impact on the fitness of organisms due to the match or
   mismatch between an individual's environmental optimum and the current
   conditions along the gradient. Importantly, gradients also provide
   individuals with information on environmental changes because dispersing
   individuals may sense whether environmental conditions improve or
   deteriorate. However, the ability of organisms to use this information
   on the environment and to subsequently adjust dispersal decisions
   plastically, that is, deciding to further disperse into the gradient or
   not, has been largely ignored and the macroecological consequences
   remain unclear. We here aim to demonstrate the impact of informed
   dispersal on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of ranges.
   Location Laboratory and theoretical.
   Methods We used individual-based simulations and controlled experiments
   in replicated microcosm landscapes. Range expansions of the protist
   model organism Tetrahymena were tracked using video recording and
   analysis.
   Results We show that information on environmental gradients had a severe
   impact on range dynamics and inverted the spatial distribution of
   population densities in comparison with controls where this information
   was not provided. Additionally, the use of information on gradients
   prevented evolutionary changes in dispersal rates and an acceleration of
   range expansion.
   Main conclusions We demonstrate the strong impact of informed dispersal
   and subsequent behavioural changes on range dynamics in environmental
   gradients. More generally, our findings highlight the importance of
   informed dispersal for spatial ecological and evolutionary dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Most experimental biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research to date
   has addressed herbaceous plant communities. Comparably little is known
   about how forest communities will respond to species losses, despite
   their importance for global biogeochemical cycling. We studied tree
   species interactions in experimental subtropical tree communities with
   33 distinct tree species mixtures and one, two, or four species. Plots
   were either exposed to natural light levels or shaded. Trees grew
   rapidly and were intensely competing above ground after 1.5 growing
   seasons when plots were thinned and the vertical distribution of leaves
   and wood determined by separating the biomass of harvested trees into 50
   cm height increments. Our aim was to analyze effects of species richness
   in relation to the vertical allocation of leaf biomass and wood, with an
   emphasis on bipartite competitive interactions among species.
   Aboveground productivity increased with species richness. The
   community-level vertical leaf and wood distribution depended on the
   species composition of communities. Mean height and breadth of
   species-level vertical leaf and wood distributions did not change with
   species richness. However, the extra biomass produced by mixtures
   compared to monocultures of the component species increased when
   vertical leaf distributions of monocultures were more different.
   Decomposition of biodiversity effects with the additive partitioning
   scheme indicated positive complementarity effects that were higher in
   light than in shade. Selection effects did not deviate from zero,
   irrespective of light levels. Vertical leaf distributions shifted apart
   in mixed stands as consequence of competition-driven phenotypic
   plasticity, promoting realized complementarity. Structural equation
   models showed that this effect was larger for species that differed more
   in growth strategies that were characterized by functional traits. In 13
   of the 18 investigated two-species mixtures, both species benefitted
   relative to intraspecific competition in monoculture. In the remaining
   five pairwise mixtures, the relative yield gain of one species exceeded
   the relative yield loss of the other species, resulting in a relative
   yield total (RYT) exceeding 1. Overall, our analysis indicates that
   richness-productivity relationships are promoted by interspecific niche
   complementarity at early stages of stand development, and that this
   effect is enhanced by architectural plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Ozonation of secondary wastewater effluents can reduce the discharge of
   micropollutants by transforming their chemical structures. Therefore, a
   better understanding of the formation of transformation products during
   ozonation is important. In this study, a computer-based prediction
   platform for the kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of ozone with
   organic compounds was developed to enable in silico predictions of
   transformation products. With the developed prediction platform,
   reaction kinetics expressed as second-order rate constants for the
   reactions of ozone with selected organic compounds (k(O3), M-1 s(-1))
   can be predicted based on an adapted k(O3) prediction model from a
   previous study (Lee et al., Environ. Sci. Technol., 2015, 49, 9925-9935)
   (average model error of about a factor of 6 for 14 compound classes with
   284 model compounds). Ozone reaction mechanisms reported in the
   literature have been reviewed and, using chemoinformatics tools, encoded
   into about 340 individual reaction rules that can be generally applied
   to predict the transformation products of micropollutants. Predictions
   for k(O3) and/or transformation products were overall consistent with
   the experimental data for three micropollutants used as validation
   compounds (e.g., carbamazepine, tramadol, and triclosan). However,
   limitations of the current k(O3) prediction platform were also
   identified: ambiguous assignment of the n-th highest occupied molecular
   orbital energy (EHOMO-n) to the reactive sites, potential errors
   associated with the use of a gas-phase geometry, and a poor k(O3)
   prediction for certain compounds (cetirizine). Therefore, the current
   prediction tool should not be considered as a substitute for
   experimental studies and experimental data are still required in the
   future to obtain a more robust prediction model. Nonetheless, the
   developed prediction platform, made available as a stand-alone graphical
   user interface (GUI) application, will provide useful information about
   aqueous ozone chemistry to various groups of end-users such as
   environmental chemists, engineers, or toxicologists.}},

Abstract = {{Iron and zinc deficiencies negatively impact human health worldwide. We
   developed wheat lines that meet or exceed recommended dietary target
   levels for iron and zinc in the grains. These lines represent useful
   germplasm for breeding new wheat varieties that can reduce iron and zinc

   Micronutrient deficiencies, including iron and zinc deficiencies, have
   negative impacts on human health globally. Iron-deficiency; anemia
   affects nearly two billion people worldwide and is the cause of reduced
   cognitive development, fatigue and overall low productivity. Similarly,
   zinc deficiency causes stunted growth, decreased immunity and increased
   risk of respiratory infections. Biofortification of staple crops is a
   sustainable and effective approach to reduce the burden of health
   problems associated with micronutrient deficiencies. Here, we developed
   wheat lines expressing rice NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE 2 (OsNAS2) and bean
   FERRITIN (PvFERRITIN) as single genes as well as in combination. NAS
   catalyzes the biosynthesis of nicotianamine (NA), which is a precursor
   of the iron chelator deoxymugeneic acid (DMA) required for long distance
   iron translocation. FERRITIN is important for iron storage in plants
   because it can store up to 4500 iron ions. We obtained significant
   increases of iron and zinc content in wheat grains of plants expressing
   either OsNAS2 or PvFERRTIN, or both genes. In particular, wheat lines
   expressing OsNAS2 greatly surpass the HarvestPlus recommended target
   level of 30 \% dietary estimated average requirement (EAR) for iron, and
   40 \% of EAR for zinc, with lines containing 93.1 A mu g/g of iron and
   140.6 A mu g/g of zinc in the grains. These wheat lines with dietary
   significant levels of iron and zinc represent useful germplasm for
   breeding new wheat varieties that can reduce micronutrient deficiencies

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   Although shrubs are an important component of forests, their role has
   not yet been considered in forest biodiversity experiments. In the
   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment with subtropical
   tree species in south-east China (BEF-China), we factorially combined
   tree with shrub species-diversity treatments. Here, we tested the
   hypotheses that shrub survival differs between the 10 planted shrub
   species, with lower survival rates of late-than early-successional
   species and is affected by environmental conditions, such as topography
   and top soil characteristics, as well as by biotic factors, represented
   by tree, shrub and herb layer characteristics.
   Methods
   We analyzed the survival of 42 000 shrub individuals in 105 plots
   varying in tree and shrub species richness of the BEF-China project four
   years after planting. Shrub survival was analyzed with generalized
   linear mixed effects models at the level of individuals and with
   variance partitioning at the plot level. Random intercept and random
   slope models of different explanatory variables were compared with
   respect to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
   Important Findings
   Survival rates differed largely between the 10 shrub species, ranging
   from 26\% to 91\% for Ardisia crenata and Distylium buxifolium,
   respectively. Irrespective of species identity, single abiotic factors
   explained up to 5\% of species survival, with a negative effect of
   altitude and slope inclination and a positive effect of the topsoil
   carbon to nitrogen ratio, which pointed to drought as the major cause of
   shrub mortality. In contrast, neither tree nor shrub richness affected
   shrub survival at this early stage of the experiment. Among the biotic
   predictors, only herb layer species richness and cover of the dominant
   fern species (Dicranopteris pedata) affected shrub survival. Overall,
   our models that included all variables could explain about 65\% in shrub
   survival, with environmental variables being most influential, followed
   by shrub species identity, while tree species diversity (species
   richness and identity) and herb layer characteristics contributed much
   less. Thus, in this early stage of the experiment the biotic
   interactions among shrubs and between shrubs and trees have not yet
   overruled the impact of abiotic environmental factors.}},

   relationship to plant functional types than to plant life/growth forms.
   However, the connection between a vegetation community's functional and
   spectral response remains to be established. We assessed the correlation
   structure between (i) biochemical and structural vegetation traits
   (biomass, dry matter content, nitrogen content, neutral detergent fibre
   content), (ii) plant life/growth forms and (iii) seven plant functional
   types of two categories (strategy types, indicator values) collected in
   heterogeneous alpine grassland. We then used airborne imaging
   spectroscopy data from the same area to model and predict plant
   life/growth forms and plant functional types at the vegetation community
   level using partial least squares regression and validated our models
   based on an independent data set. We found high correlations between
   many of the biochemical and structural vegetation traits, plant
   life/growth forms and plant functional types tested. Using airborne
   imaging spectroscopy data, we successfully modelled and predicted most
   plant life/growth forms (R-2 max.=056) and all plant functional types
   (R-2 max.=062). However, model performance for plant life/growth forms
   decreased substantially during external validation and overall model
   consistency was low (average change in R-2=72\%), while plant functional
   type models were much more consistent (average change in R-2=20\%).
   Based on our findings, we developed a conceptual framework using the
   theory and methodology of vegetation ecology and imaging spectroscopy to
   link the vegetation community's functional to its spectral signature.
   Our results encourage the use of plant functional types in imaging
   spectroscopy in order to aid the large-scale monitoring of ecosystems,
   which is particularly important given the increased availability of
   airborne data and the prospective launches of spaceborne instruments in
   the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we describe a strategy to improve broad-spectrum leaf rust
   resistance by marker-assisted combination of two partial resistance
   genes. One of them represents a novel partial adult plant resistance
   gene, named Lr75.
   Leaf rust caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia triticina is a damaging
   disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The combination of several,
   additively-acting partial disease resistance genes has been proposed as
   a suitable strategy to breed wheat cultivars with high levels of durable
   field resistance. The Swiss winter wheat cultivar `Forno' continues to
   show near-immunity to leaf rust since its release in the 1980s. This
   resistance is conferred by the presence of at least six quantitative
   trait loci (QTL), one of which is associated with the morphological
   trait leaf tip necrosis. Here, we used a marker-informed strategy to
   introgress two `Forno' QTLs into the leaf rust-susceptible Swiss winter
   wheat cultivar `Arina'. The resulting backcross line `ArinaLrFor' showed
   markedly increased leaf rust resistance in multiple locations over
   several years. One of the introgressed QTLs, QLr.sfr-1BS, is located on
   chromosome 1BS. We developed chromosome 1B-specific microsatellite
   markers by exploiting the Illumina survey sequences of wheat cv.
   `Chinese Spring' and mapped QLr.sfr-1BS to a 4.3 cM interval flanked by
   the SSR markers gwm604 and swm271. QLr.sfr-1BS does not share a genetic
   location with any of the described leaf rust resistance genes present on
   chromosome 1B. Therefore, QLr.sfr-1BS is novel and was designated as
   Lr75. We conclude that marker-assisted combination of partial resistance
   genes is a feasible strategy to increase broad-spectrum leaf rust
   resistance. The identification of Lr75 adds a novel and highly useful
   gene to the small set of known partial, adult plant leaf rust resistance
   genes.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of flood event magnitudes with a certain return period are
   required for the design of hydraulic structures. While the return period
   is clearly defined in a univariate context, its definition is more
   challenging when the problem at hand requires considering the dependence
   between two or more variables in a multivariate framework. Several ways
   of defining a multivariate return period have been proposed in the
   literature, which all rely on different probability concepts.
   Definitions use the conditional probability, the joint probability, or
   can be based on the Kendall's distribution or survival function. In this
   study, we give a comprehensive overview on the tools that are available
   to define a return period in a multivariate context. We especially
   address engineers, practitioners, and people who are new to the topic
   and provide them with an accessible introduction to the topic. We
   outline the theoretical background that is needed when one is in a
   multivariate setting and present the reader with different definitions
   for a bivariate return period. Here, we focus on flood events and the
   different probability concepts are explained with a pedagogical,
   illustrative example of a flood event characterized by the two variables
   peak discharge and flood volume. The choice of the return period has an
   important effect on the magnitude of the design variable quantiles,
   which is illustrated with a case study in Switzerland. However, this
   choice is not arbitrary and depends on the problem at hand. (C) 2016

Volume = {{569}},
Pages = {{1064-1076}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Deadwood is known to significantly contribute to global terrestrial
   carbon stocks and carbon cycling, but its decay dynamics are still not
   thoroughly understood. Although the chemistry of deadwood has been
   studied as a function of decay stage in temperate to subalpine
   environments, it has generally not been related to time. We therefore
   studied the decay (mass of deadwood, cellulose and lignin) of
   equal-sized blocks of Picea abies wood in soil-mesocosms over two years
   in the Italian Alps. The 8 sites selected were along an altitudinal
   sequence, reflecting different climate zones. In addition, the effect of
   exposure (north-and south-facing slopes) was taken into account. The
   decay dynamics of the mass of deadwood, cellulose and lignin were
   related to soil parameters (pH, soil texture, moisture, temperature) and
   climatic data. The decay rate constants of Picea abies deadwood were low
   (on average between 0.039 and 0.040 y(-1)) and of lignin close to zero
   (or not detectable), while cellulose reacted much faster with average
   decay rate constants between 0.110 and 0.117 y(-1). Our field
   experiments showed that local scale factors, such as soil parameters and
   topographic properties, influenced the decay process: higher soil
   moisture and clay content along with a lower pH seemed to accelerate
   wood decay. Interestingly, air temperature negatively correlated with
   decay rates or positively with the amount of wood components on
   south-facing sites. It exerted its influence rather on moisture
   availability, i.e. the lower the temperature the higher the moisture
   availability. Topographic features were also relevant with generally
   slower decay processes on south-facing sites than on north-facing sites
   owing to the drier conditions, the higher pH and the lower weathering
   state of the soils ( less clay minerals). This study highlights the
   importance of a multifactorial consideration of edaphic parameters to
   unravel the complex dynamics of initial wood decay. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In connection with the ongoing disappearance of glaciers in cold
   mountains, a great number of new lakes come into existence. The sites
   and approximate formation time of such potential new lakes can be
   realistically modelled. This provides an important knowledge base for
   planning the management of at least the larger ones among such lakes.
   New water bodies can markedly increase the hazard and risk potential for
   down-valley areas in the long term, especially in relation to
   impact/flood waves triggered by rock/ice avalanches from the steep icy
   peaks surrounding them. However, they also offer opportunities for use
   in connection with tourism, water supply and hydropower production.
   Legal regulations and aspects of landscape protection and nature
   conservation have to be thereby carefully considered. Possible synergies
   and conflicts exist; they can be anticipated at an early stage by a
   matrix-type analysis of interrelations between the different
   perspectives involved. A corresponding inter- and transdisciplinary
   study was performed for the currently glacierized areas of the Swiss
   Alps. The results of this study may serve as an example for dealing with
   the consequences of rapid climate-induced changes in other populated
   regions with rugged icy mountains, such as the Peruvian Cordilleras or
   the Himalaya-Karakoram region.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing image classification exploiting multiple sensors is a
   very challenging problem: data from different modalities are affected by
   spectral distortions and mis-alignments of all kinds, and this hampers
   re-using models built for one image to be used successfully in other
   scenes. In order to adapt and transfer models across image acquisitions,
   one must be able to cope with datasets that are not co-registered,
   acquired under different illumination and atmospheric conditions, by
   different sensors, and with scarce ground references. Traditionally,
   methods based on histogram matching have been used. However, they fail
   when densities have very different shapes or when there is no
   corresponding band to be matched between the images. An alternative
   builds upon manifold alignment. Manifold alignment performs a
   multidimensional relative normalization of the data prior to product
   generation that can cope with data of different dimensionality (e.g.
   different number of bands) and possibly unpaired examples. Aligning data
   distributions is an appealing strategy, since it allows to provide data
   spaces that are more similar to each other, regardless of the subsequent
   use of the transformed data. In this paper, we study a methodology that
   aligns data from different domains in a nonlinear way through
   kernelization. We introduce the Kernel Manifold Alignment (KEMA) method,
   which provides a flexible and discriminative projection map, exploits
   only a few labeled samples (or semantic ties) in each domain, and
   reduces to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. We successfully
   test KEMA in multi-temporal and multi-source very high resolution
   classification tasks, as well as on the task of making a model invariant
   to shadowing for hyperspectral imaging. (C) 2016 International Society

Abstract = {{Remote sensing (RS)'approaches commonly applied to constrain estimates
   of gross primary production (GPP) employ greenness-based vegetation
   indices derived from surface reflectance data. Such approaches cannot
   capture dynamic changes of photosynthesis rates as caused by
   environmental stress. Further, applied vegetation indices are often
   affected by background reflectance or saturation effects. Sun. induced
   chlorophyll fluorescence (F) provides the most direct measure of
   photosynthesis and has been recently proposed as a new RS approach to
   improve estimates of GPP and tracing plant stress reactions. This work
   aims to provide further evidence on the complementary information
   content of F and its relation to changes in photosynthetic activity
   compared to traditional RS approaches. We use the airborne imaging
   spectrometer HyPlant to obtain several F products including red
   fluorescence (F-687), far-red fluorescence (F-760), F-760 yield
   (F-760yield) and the ration between F-687 and F-760 (F-ratio). We
   calculate several vegetation indices indicative for vegetation
   greenness. We apply a recently proposed F-based semi-mechanistic
   approach to improve the forward modeling of GPP using F-760 and compare
   this approach with a traditional one based on vegetation greenness and
   ground measurements of GPP derived from chamber measurements. In
   addition, we assess the sensitivity of F-760yield and Fratio for
   environmental stress. Our results show an improved predictive capability
   of GPP when using F-760 compared to greenness-based vegetation indices.
   F-760yield and F-ratio show a strong variability in time and between
   different crop types suffering from different levels of water shortage,
   indicating a strong sensitivity of F products for plant stress
   reactions. We conclude that the new RS approach of F provides
   complements to the set of commonly applies RS: The use of F-760 improves
   constraining estimates of GPP while the ratio of red and far-red F shows
   large potential for tracking spatio-temporal plant adaptation in
   response to environmental stress conditions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Ecosystems are linked to neighbouring ecosystems not only by dispersal,
   but also by the movement of subsidy. Such subsidy couplings between
   ecosystems have important landscape-scale implications because
   perturbations in one ecosystem may affect community structure and
   functioning in neighbouring ecosystems via increased/decreased
   subsidies. Here, we combine a general theoretical approach based on
   harvesting theory and a two-patch protist meta ecosystem experiment to
   test the effect of regional perturbations on local community dynamics.
   We first characterized the relationship between the perturbation regime
   and local population demography on detritus production using a
   mathematical model. We then experimentally simulated a perturbation
   gradient affecting connected ecosystems simultaneously, thus altering
   cross ecosystem subsidy exchanges. We demonstrate that the perturbation
   regime can interact with local population dynamics to trigger unexpected
   temporal variations in subsidy pulses from one ecosystem to another.
   High perturbation intensity initially led to the highest level of
   subsidy flows; however, the level of perturbation interacted with
   population dynamics to generate a crash in subsidy exchange over time.
   Both theoretical and experimental results show that a perturbation
   regime interacting with local community dynamics can induce a collapse
   in population levels for recipient ecosystems. These results call for
   integrative management of human-altered landscapes that takes into
   account regional dynamics of both species and resource flows.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to ambient air pollution (AP) exposure has been linked to type
   2 diabetes (T2D) risk. Evidence on the impact of T2D genetic variants on
   AP susceptibility is lacking. Compared to single variants, joint genetic
   variants contribute substantially to disease risk. We investigated the
   modification of AP and diabetes association by a genetic risk score
   (GRS) covering 63 T2D genes in 1524.first follow-up participants of the
   Swiss cohort study on air pollution and lung and heart diseases in
   adults. Genome-wide data and covariates were available from a nested
   asthma case-control study design. AP was estimated as 10-year mean
   residential particulate matter <10 mu m (PM10). We computed count-GRS
   and weighted-GRS, and applied PM10 interaction terms in mixed logistic
   regressions, on odds of diabetes. Analyses were stratified by pathways
   of diabetes pathology and by asthma status. Diabetes prevalence was
   4.6\% and mean exposure to PM10 was 22 mu g/m(3). Odds of diabetes
   increased by 8\% (95\% confidence interval: 2, 14\%) per T2D risk allele
   and by 35\% ( 8, 97\%) per 10 mu g/m(3) exposure to PM10. We observed a
   positive interaction between PK and count-GRS on diabetes
   {[}ORinteraction = 1.10 (1.01, 120)], associations being strongest among
   participants at the highest quartile of count-GRS {[}OR: 1.97 (1.00,
   3.87)]. Stronger interactions were observed with variants of the GRS
   involved in insulin resistance {[}(ORinteraction = 1.22 (1.00,1.50)]
   than with variants related to beta-cell function. Interactions with
   count-GRS were stronger among asthma cases. We observed similar results
   with weighted-GRS. Five single variants near GRB14, UBE2E2, PTPRD,
   VPS26A and KCNQ1 showed nominally significant interactions with PM10 (P
   < 0.05). Our results suggest that genetic risk for T2D may modify
   susceptibility to air pollution through alterations in insulin
   sensitivity. These results need confirmation in diabetes cohort
   consortia. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid zones allow the measurement of gene flow across the genome,
   producing insight into the genomic architecture of speciation. Such
   analysis is particularly powerful when applied to multiple pairs of
   hybridizing species, as patterns of genomic differentiation can then be
   related to age of the hybridizing species, providing a view into the
   build-up of differentiation over time. We examined 33 809 single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three hybridizing woodpecker species:
   Red-breasted, Red-naped and Yellow-bellied sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus
   ruber, Sphyrapicus nuchalis and Sphyrapicus varius), two of which (ruber
   and nuchalis) are much more closely related than each is to the third
   (varius). To identify positions of SNPs on chromosomes, we developed a
   localization method based on comparative genomics. We found narrow
   clines, bimodal distributions of hybrid indices and genomic regions with
   decreased rates of introgression. These results suggest moderately
   strong reproductive isolation among species and selection against
   specific hybrid genotypes. We found 19 small regions of strong
   differentiation between species, partly shared among species pairs, but
   no large regions of differentiation. An association analysis revealed a
   single strong-effect candidate locus associated with plumage, possibly
   explaining mismatch among the three species in genomic relatedness and
   plumage similarity. Our comparative analysis of species pairs of
   different age and their hybrid zones showed that moderately strong
   reproductive isolation can occur with little genomic differentiation,
   but that reproductive isolation is incomplete even with much greater
   genomic differentiation, implying there are long periods of time when
   hybridization is possible if diverging populations are in geographic
   contact.}},

Abstract = {{Version 3 of ecoinvent includes more data, new modeling principles, and,
   for the first time, several system models: the ``Allocation, cut-off by
   classification{''} (Cut-off) system model, which replicates the modeling
   principles of version 2, and two newly introduced models called
   ``Allocation at the point of substitution{''} (APOS) and
   ``Consequential{''} (Wernet et al. 2016). The aim of this paper is to
   analyze and explain the differences in life cycle impact assessment
   (LCIA) results of the v3.1 Cut-off system model in comparison to v2.2 as
   well as the APOS and Consequential system models.
   In order to do this, functionally equivalent datasets were matched
   across database versions and LCIA results compared to each other. In
   addition, the contribution of specific sectors was analyzed. The
   importance of new and updated data as well as new modeling principles is
   illustrated through examples.
   Differences were observed in between all database versions using the
   impact assessment methods Global Warming Potential (GWP100a), ReCiPe
   Endpoint (H/A), and Ecological Scarcity 2006 (ES'06). The highest
   differences were found for the comparison of the v3.1 Cut-off and v2.2.
   At average, LCIA results increased by 6, 8, and 17 \% and showed a
   median dataset deviation of 13, 13, and 21 \% for GWP, ReCiPe, and
   ES'06, respectively. These changes are due to the simultaneous update
   and addition of new data as well as through the introduction of global
   coverage and spatially consistent linking of activities throughout the
   database. As a consequence, supply chains are now globally better
   represented than in version 2 and lead, e.g., in the electricity sector,
   to more realistic life cycle inventory (LCI) background data. LCIA
   results of the Cut-off and APOS models are similar and differ mainly for
   recycling materials and wastes. In contrast, LCIA results of the
   Consequential version differ notably from the attributional system
   models, which is to be expected due to fundamentally different modeling
   principles. The use of marginal instead of average suppliers in markets,
   i.e., consumption mixes, is the main driver for result differences.
   LCIA results continue to change as LCI databases evolve, which is
   confirmed by a historical comparison of v1.3 and v2.2. Version 3
   features more up-to-date background data as well as global supply chains
   and should, therefore, be used instead of previous versions. Continuous
   efforts will be required to decrease the contribution of
   Rest-of-the-World (RoW) productions and thereby improve the global
   coverage of supply chains.}},

Abstract = {{Two species of Australian desert ants, one inhabiting a visually rich
   environment (Melophorus bagoti) and one inhabiting a visually barren
   environment (as yet unnamed and dubbed Melophorus sp.), were tested on
   path integration and subsequent search. For each species, prominent
   landmarks were placed near the nest, and ants were trained to visit a
   feeder. After training over 2 days, an ant was captured at the feeder
   when it had grabbed some food and tested, just once individually, in
   homing with the training landmarks either present or absent. Their
   subsequent search was also recorded on gridded paper according to a grid
   marked at the test site. Both species headed initially in the
   feeder-nest direction, but directional scatter was larger when training
   landmarks were absent. Melophorus bagoti ran a shorter distance before
   starting to search on tests with the landmarks absent, but Melophorus
   sp. ran a similar distance in both conditions. In both species, the
   variance in distance run was larger when landmarks were absent. In
   searching, both species expanded their search pattern more when
   landmarks were absent than when landmarks were present. Contrary to
   predictions, the distribution of the lengths of search segments was best
   described as a single exponential function on tests with landmarks
   absent and as a double exponential function with landmarks present.
   Two species of Australian desert ants of the same genus but occupying
   visually different habitats were studied in similar experiments. One
   inhabits a barren saltpan while the other inhabits a semi-arid
   environment filled with grass, shrubs and trees. The ants were compared
   in their return home after a short outbound trip (2 m) to a feeder and
   the subsequent search for the nest. When the ants were trained in an
   environment with some prominent artificial landmarks which were
   subsequently removed in tests, ants living in the visually cluttered
   habitat cut short their initial run, starting to engage in search
   earlier than ants living on the salt pan. Search characteristics were,
   on the other hand, similar in the two species, both expanding their
   search loops over time, more so when the familiar scene was changed.
   Visual ecology drives some aspects of navigation, while common task
   requirements drive other aspects.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this research was to investigate whether there has been a
   whole-genome duplication (WGD) in the ancestry of Sphagnum (peatmoss) or
   the class Sphagnopsida, and to determine if the timing of any such
   duplication(s) and patterns of paralog retention could help explain the
   rapid radiation and current ecological dominance of peatmosses.
   RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data were generated for nine taxa in
   Sphagnopsida (Bryophyta). Analyses of frequency plots for synonymous
   substitutions per synonymous site (K-s) between paralogous gene pairs
   and reconciliation of 578 gene trees were conducted to assess evidence
   of large-scale or genome-wide duplication events in each transcriptome.
   Both Ks frequency plots and gene tree-based analyses indicate multiple
   duplication events in the history of the Sphagnopsida. The most recent
   WGD event predates divergence of Sphagnum from the two other genera of
   Sphagnopsida. Duplicate retention is highly variable across species,
   which might be best explained by local adaptation.
   Our analyses indicate that the last WGD could have been an important
   factor underlying the diversification of peatmosses and facilitated
   their rise to ecological dominance in peatlands. The timing of the
   duplication events and their significance in the evolutionary history of
   peat mosses are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Bryophyllum pinnatum(syn. Kalanchoe pinnata) is a succulent perennial
   plant native to Madagascar that was introduced in anthroposophic
   medicine in the early 20th century. In recent years, we conducted a
   large collaborative project to provide reliable data on the chemical
   composition, pharmacological properties, and clinical efficacy of
   Bryophyllum. Here, we comprehensively review the phytochemistry, as well
   as the pharmacological and clinical data. As to the pharmacology,
   special emphasis is given to properties related to the use in
   anthroposophic medicine as a treatment for ``hyperactivity diseases{''},
   such as preterm labor, restlessness, and sleep disorders. Studies
   suggesting that B. pinnatum may become a new treatment option for
   overactive bladder syndrome are also reviewed. Tolerability is
   addressed, and toxicological data are discussed in conjunction with the
   presence of potentially toxic bufadienolides in Bryophyllum species. The
   few data available on two related species with medicinal uses,
   Bryophyllum daigremontianum and Bryophyllum delagoense, have also been
   included. Taken together, current data support the use of B. pinnatum
   for the mentioned indications, but further studies are needed to fully
   understand the modes of action, and to identify the pharmacologically
   active constituents.}},

Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Whole-genome duplication (WGD) in angiosperms has
   been hypothesized to be advantageous in unstable environments and/or to
   increase diversification rates, leading to radiations. Under the first
   hypothesis, floras in stable environments are predicted to have lower
   proportions of polyploids than highly, recently disturbed floras,
   whereas species-rich floras would be expected to have higher than
   expected proportions of polyploids under the second. The South African
   Cape flora is used to discriminate between these two hypotheses because
   it features a hyperdiverse flora predominantly generated by a limited
   number of radiations (Cape clades), against a backdrop of climatic and
   geological stability.
   METHODS: We compiled all known chromosome counts for species in 21
   clades present in the Cape (1653 species, including 24 Cape clades),
   inferred ploidy levels for these species by inspection or derived from
   the primary literature, and compared Cape to non-Cape ploidy levels in
   these clades (17,520 species) using G tests.
   KEY RESULTS: The Cape flora has anomalously low proportions of
   polyploids compared with global levels. This pattern is consistently
   observed across nearly half the clades and across global latitudinal
   gradients, although individual lineages seem to be following different
   paths to low levels of WGD and to differing degrees.
   CONCLUSIONS: This pattern shows that the diversity of the Cape flora is
   the outcome of primarily diploid radiations and supports the hypothesis
   that WGD may be rare in stable environments.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic biodiversity in rivers and streams is threatened in many regions
   worldwide. As biodiversity loss has severe consequences on ecosystem
   functioning, it is important to understand the causes of decline and to
   predict biodiversity in space and time. In order to achieve this, the
   identification of the driving factors and the appropriate choice of
   indicator groups are needed. We developed a spatially explicit habitat
   distribution model for aquatic macroinvertebrates in Swiss watercourse
   networks using national biodiversity monitoring data from 410 randomly
   selected sampling sites. We specifically looked at two worldwide
   frequently used macroinvertebrate indicator groups. Using generalized
   linear models, we related firstly species richness of mayfly, stonefly
   and caddisfly (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera; EPT) and secondly
   richness of all macroinvertebrate families and higher-order taxa
   (macroinvertebrate family richness) to 38 nationwide available
   environmental variables. We then predicted richness of both indicator
   groups at the landscape scale, providing the first nationwide prediction
   of EPT species and macroinvertebrate family richness. Consistent with
   previous work, we found that variables describing land use and topology
   were most important for explaining richness at the landscape level.
   However, the two indicator groups showed opposing patterns of richness
   and a different sensitivity to land-use variables. This indicates that
   the sole use of one of these groups may be misleading with respect to
   water quality assessments and to the identification of overall diversity
   hotspots. We conclude that commonly used richness patterns derived from
   aggregated groups, such as family-level macroinvertebrate richness, may
   be less appropriate for conservation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In aquatic ecosystems invasive species are among the most important
   threats to biodiversity worldwide. Understanding the dispersal
   mechanisms of aquatic invaders is very important for protection and
   management of vulnerable water bodies. Here we ask how recreational
   boats that are transported overland could contribute to the dispersal of
   invasive zebra mussels among lakes in Switzerland. Using a questionnaire
   sent to registered boat owners, we surveyed properties of transported
   boats and collected information on self-reported mussel fouling and
   transport activities of boat owners. We also sampled boat hulls at
   launching ramps and harbors for biofouling invertebrates. Boats that
   were kept seasonally or year-round in water were found to have high
   vector potential with mussel fouling rates of more than 40 \%. However,
   only about 6 \% of boats belonging to these groups were transported
   overland to other water bodies. Considering that approximately 100,000
   recreational boats are registered in Switzerland, we estimated that
   every year around 1400 boats fouled with mussels are transported
   overland. Such boats pose a high risk of distributing zebra mussels
   between water bodies. Our results suggest that there is a considerable
   risk that recreational boats may spread new fouling species to all
   navigable water bodies within the study area. We speculate that one such
   species could be the quagga mussel, which has not yet invaded lakes in
   Switzerland. On a more positive note, our study has identified the group
   of high-risk boats so that possible control measures would only affect a
   relatively small number of boat owners.}},

Title = {{Beyond climate: convergence in fast evolving sclerophylls in Cape and
   Australian Rhamnaceae predates the mediterranean climate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Morphological convergence in mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs) has
   long been interpreted as adaptation to climatic similarities among the
   five MTEs of the world. Here, we challenge this model using the globally
   distributed Rhamnaceae.
   2. We collected functional trait data (specific leaf area, leaf area,
   spinescence, leaf phenology, growth form and leaf margin type) and biome
   data to test for trait convergence in MTEs, for models of trait
   evolution and ancestral state reconstruction and for the effect of
   traits on speciation and extinction rates, using a phylogenetic
   framework.
   3. We show that leaf functional traits evolve to three optima, which
   correspond to (i) the edaphically specialized Australian and Cape MTEs
   (AC), (ii) the mediterranean-type climates, but edaphically normal
   Chile, California and Mediterranean Basin (CCM) and (iii) the
   non-mediterranean habitats. We find that Rhamnaceae in CCM are
   predominantly characterized by non-sclerophylly, the ancestral state in
   Rhamnaceae, and Rhamnaceae in AC by sclerophylly. These leaf character
   syndromes have evolved prior to mediterranean climates in MTEs, thereby
   failing to be adaptive to this selective regime. However, sclerophylly
   evolved contemporaneously with the transitions to AC and may therefore
   be an adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.
   4. The evolution of sclerophylly has contributed to increased
   diversification rates of Pomaderreae in Australia and Phyliceae in the
   Cape, by reducing extinction rates and thereby facilitating evolutionary
   persistence. The historical relatively stable conditions in AC are
   consistent with this persistence hypothesis.
   5. Synthesis. In this study, we integrate the fields of macroevolution
   and ecology and show that low extinction rates may not only account for
   the ecological, but also for the floristic dominance of sclerophylly in
   the hyperdiverse Australian and Cape mediterranean-type ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{To test whether protist grazing selectively affects the composition of
   aquatic bacterial communities, we combined high-throughput sequencing to
   determine bacterial community composition with analyses of grazing
   rates, protist and bacterial abundances and bacterial cell sizes and
   physiological states in a mesocosm experiment in which nutrients were
   added to stimulate a phytoplankton bloom. A large variability was
   observed in the abundances of bacteria (from 0.7 to 2.4 x 10(6) cells
   per ml), heterotrophic nanoflagellates (from 0.063 to 2.7 x 10(4) cells
   per ml) and ciliates (from 100 to 3000 cells per l) during the
   experiment (similar to 3-, 45- and 30-fold, respectively), as well as in
   bulk grazing rates (from 1 to 13 x 10(6) bacteria per ml per day) and
   bacterial production (from 3 to 379 mu g per Cl per day) (1 and 2 orders
   of magnitude, respectively). However, these strong changes in predation
   pressure did not induce comparable responses in bacterial community
   composition, indicating that bacterial community structure was resilient
   to changes in protist predation pressure. Overall, our results indicate
   that peaks in protist predation (at least those associated with
   phytoplankton blooms) do not necessarily trigger substantial changes in
   the composition of coastal marine bacterioplankton communities.}},

Abstract = {{Why are some introduced species more successful at establishing and
   spreading than others? Until now, characteristics of extant species have
   been intensively investigated to answer this question. We propose to
   gain new insights on species invasiveness by exploring the long-term
   biogeographic and evolutionary history of lineages.
   We exemplify our approach using one of the best-studied invasive plant
   genera, Pinus. We notably estimated the historical biogeography of pines
   and the rates of trait evolution in pines. These estimates were analysed
   with regard to species invasiveness status.
   The results revealed that currently invasive species belong to lineages
   that were particularly successful at colonizing new regions in the past.
   We also showed that highly mobile lineages had faster rates of niche
   evolution, but that these rates are poor proxies for species adaptive
   potential in invaded regions (estimated by niche shift among native and
   invaded regions).
   In summary, working at the interface of ecology, historical biogeography
   and evolutionary history offers stimulating perspectives to improve our
   understanding of the drivers of invasion success.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the great number and variety of glaciers in southern South
   America, in situ glacier mass-balance records are extremely scarce and
   glacier-climate relationships are still poorly understood in this
   region. Here we use the longest (> aEuro-35 years) and most complete in
   situ mass-balance record, available for the Echaurren Norte glacier
   (ECH) in the Andes at similar to aEuro-33.5 degrees aEuro-S, to develop
   a minimal glacier surface mass-balance model that relies on nearby
   monthly precipitation and air temperature data as forcing. This basic
   model is able to explain 78aEuro-\% of the variance in the annual
   glacier mass-balance record over the 1978-2013 calibration period. An
   attribution assessment identified precipitation variability as the
   dominant forcing modulating annual mass balances at ECH, with
   temperature variations likely playing a secondary role. A regionally
   averaged series of mean annual streamflow records from both sides of the
   Andes between similar to aEuro-30 and 37 degrees aEuro-S is then used to
   estimate, through simple linear regression, this glacier's annual
   mass-balance variations since 1909. The reconstruction model captures
   68aEuro-\% of the observed glacier mass-balance variability and shows
   three periods of sustained positive mass balances embedded in an overall
   negative trend over the past 105 years. The three periods of sustained
   positive mass balances (centered in the 1920s-1930s, in the 1980s and in
   the first decade of the 21st century) coincide with several documented
   glacier advances in this region. Similar trends observed in other
   shorter glacier mass-balance series suggest that the Echaurren Norte
   glacier reconstruction is representative of larger-scale conditions and
   could be useful for more detailed glaciological, hydrological and
   climatological assessments in this portion of the Andes.}},

Title = {{Beneficiary feedback effects on alpine cushion benefactors become more
   negative with increasing cover of graminoids and in dry conditions}},

Abstract = {{1. In facilitative interactions, the beneficiary feedback effect (BFE)
   has been defined as the effect of beneficiary species (facilitated
   species) on their benefactor. BFEs have been shown to be dependent on
   environmental conditions and the composition of the beneficiary
   community. In alpine cushion systems, BFEs are more negative with more
   abundant, diverse and phylogenetically aggregated communities of
   beneficiary species.
   2. We tested the hypothesis that the functional composition of the
   beneficiary communities correlates with the direction and strength of
   BFE received by alpine cushion benefactors and specifically that a more
   negative BFE would occur with increasing density of graminoids and a
   more positive BFE would occur with increasing density of forbs and
   legumes. Additionally, we predicted that the negative BFE of graminoids
   would increase with increasing summer aridity.
   3. We used a data base of alpine cushion communities from 30 sites
   throughout the world to assess the overall relationship between the
   composition of beneficiary communities and the total flower density of
   cushion benefactors, and its variation with increasing drought.
   Additionally, in order to assess more precisely the role of the
   functional composition of the beneficiary communities on BFE in a very
   dry site with cushion benefactors exhibiting contrasting functional
   compositions of beneficiary communities, we also designed a field study
   in the Qilian Shan mountain range (China). At this site with a highly
   continental climate, we compared the number of flowers and fruits of
   different phenotypes of the alpine cushion species Thylacospermum
   caespitosum hosting numerous graminoids, numerous forbs or very few
   beneficiary species.
   4. In the intercontinental study, we found a negative relationship
   between graminoids and cushion benefactor flower density but no effect
   of other functional groups. The negative BFE of graminoids increased
   with increasing summer drought. In the dry Qilian Shan range, we found
   both a negative effect of graminoids on total flower density and a
   positive effect of forbs on flower density and fruit set.
   5. Our study indicates that the context dependence of BFE may be
   partially explained by the composition of beneficiary communities and in
   particular the negative effect of graminoids.}},

   scientific research has to infer both general trends and context

   experimental manipulations can provide powerful scientific tools for
   inferring causal drivers of ecological change and the generality of
   their effects. Additionally, combining these two approaches can

Abstract = {{We present results from a chemical fate model quantifying incorporation
   of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the Silvretta glacier, a
   temperate Alpine glacier located in Switzerland. Temperate glaciers, in
   contrast to cold glaciers, are glaciers where melt processes are
   prevalent. Incorporation of PCBs into cold glaciers has been quantified
   in previous studies. However, the fate of PCBs in temperate glaciers has
   never been investigated. In the model, we include melt processes,
   inducing elution of water-soluble substances and, conversely, enrichment
   of particles and particle-bound chemicals. The model is validated by
   comparing modeled and measured PCB concentrations in an ice core
   collected in the Silvretta accumulation area. We quantify PCB
   incorporation between 1900 and 2010, and discuss the fate of six PCB
   congeners. PCB concentrations in the ice core peak in the period of high
   PCB emissions, as well as in years with strong melt. While for
   lower-chlorinated PCB congeners revolatilization is important, for
   higher-chlorinated congeners, the main processes are storage in glacier
   ice and removal by particle runoff. This study gives insight into PCB
   fate and dynamics and reveals the effect of snow accumulation and melt
   processes on the fate of semivolatile organic chemicals in a temperate
   Alpine glacier.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of cryptic species is an essential aim for conservation
   biologists to avoid premature extinctions of `unrecognized' species.
   Integrating different types of data can undoubtedly aid in resolving the
   issue of species delimitation. We studied here two lineages of the
   common lizard Zootoca vivipara that display different reproductive mode
   (the viviparous Z. v. vivipara and the oviparous Z. v. carniolica) and
   that overlap their distributional ranges in the European Alps. With the
   purpose of delimiting species' boundaries, we analyzed their ecological,
   genetic and natural history features. More than 300 samples were
   collected and analyzed at cytochrome b and 11 microsatellites loci for
   investigating genetic variation, population structure, individual
   relatedness and evolutionary histories of the two lineages.
   Additionally, we compared their ecological niches using eight ecological
   variables. Genetic data showed contrasting patterns of genetic structure
   between the two lineages, different demographic dynamics and no
   hybridization events. Also strong ecological differences (such as
   temperature) emerged between the two lineages, and niche overlap was
   limited. Taken together, these results indicate that Z. v. vivipara and
   Z. v. carniolica should be recognized as two separate species, and
   particular conservation consideration should be given to the oviparous
   lineage that tends to live in areas threatened by increasing impact of
   human activities. However, recent and rapid climate warming might
   determine an increasing risk for the persistence of the viviparous
   lineage, being adapted to cold environments.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the rising interest in mountain permafrost due to climatic
   changes and a noticed increase of registered rockfall events in the
   European Alps and other mountain ranges, little is known about transient
   thermal conditions in the detachment areas of rockfalls. Temperature
   conditions prior to the rockfall events of 144 past events in the
   European Alps were modelled with a physically based ground temperature
   model. To minimise the impact that uncertainty has on interpretations,
   only relative values were used, that is, percentiles obtained from
   cumulative distribution functions of the modelled ground surface
   temperatures from the beginning of the meteorological measurement series
   up to the event dates. Our results suggest that small and midsized
   rockfalls (volumes up to 100 000 m(3)) from high elevation occurred
   mainly during short-term periods of unusually high temperatures. This
   was neither found to be a result of the seasonal distribution (most
   analysed events in higher elevations occurred from July to September)
   nor of the longer-term temporal distribution (most analysed events
   occurred after 2000) only. Plausible explanations are either a
   destabilisation related to advective thaw or failure due to stress
   redistribution caused by large temperature variations. Large deep-seated
   rock slope failures (>= 100 000 m(3)) in high elevation occurred all
   year round.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of knowledge about fertilization, inadequate income to purchase
   fertilizers, limited access to the right type of fertilizers, and
   national policies have been identified as prerequisites of Sub-Saharan
   smallholder farmers' low yield and food insecurity. This paper presents
   how the smallholder access to phosphorus (SMAP) method was developed in
   a transdisciplinary process in Kenya, and what insights have been gained
   in a first application of the SMAP method. The transdisciplinary SMAP
   method comprises (1) farmers' participation in a transdisciplinary
   process including extension officers and local scientists to construct
   farm-specific fertilization strategies based on (2) farm-specific soil
   testing and (3) the construction of cooperative strategies for
   purchasing fertilizers involving farmers, traders, and financial
   institutions in a timely manner. The method aims to improve farmers'
   participation in the value chain. The development of the method followed
   the Zurich 2000 conception of transdisciplinarity. The development
   co-led by representatives of a cereal growers association and scientists
   from local and international universities included main actors of the
   national and local (phosphorus) fertilizer supply-demand chain. The
   first application of the SMAP method was evaluated by embedding an ANOVA
   (analysis of variance) study design following the ideas of experimental
   action research. There were significant effects of soil testing and a
   marginal significant effect of the transdisciplinary construction of
   farm-specific fertilization strategies. This paper presents the initial
   transdisciplinary project plan for developing the SMAP method, how the
   transdisciplinary process worked in reality, what obstacles were met in

Abstract = {{During and after the end Permian mass extinction terrestrial and marine
   biota underwent major changes and reorganizations. The latest Permian
   and earliest Triassic is also characterized by major negative carbon
   isotope shifts reflecting fundamental changes in the carbon cycle. The
   present study documents a high-resolution bulk organic carbon isotope
   record and palynofacies analysis spanning the latest Permian-earliest
   Triassic of East Greenland. An almost 700 meter thick composite section
   from Kap Stosch allowed discriminating 6 chemostratigraphic intervals
   that provide the basis for the correlation with other coeval records
   across the world, and for the recognition of basin wide
   transgressive-regressive events documenting tectonic activity during the
   opening of the Greenland-Norway Basin. The identification of the main
   factors that influenced the organic carbon isotope signal during the
   earliest Triassic (Griesbachian to Dienerian) was possible due to the
   combination of bulk organic carbon isotope, palynofacies and Rock-Eval
   data. Two negative carbon isotopic shifts in the Kap Stosch record can
   be correlated with negative shifts recorded in coeval sections across
   the globe. A first negative shift precedes the base of the Triassic as
   defined by the first occurrence of the conodont Hindeodus parvus in the
   Meishan reference section, and the second one coincides with the
   suggested Griesbachian-Dienerian boundary. This new organic carbon
   isotope record from the extended Map Stosch section from the Boreal
   Realm documents regional and global carbon cycle signals of the interval
   between the latest Palaeozoic and the onset of the Mesozoic. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Rapid evolutionary adaptation has the potential to rescue from
   extinction populations experiencing environmental changes. Little is
   known, however, about the impact of short-term environmental
   fluctuations during long-term environmental deterioration, an intrinsic
   property of realistic environmental changes. Temporary environmental
   amelioration arising from such fluctuations could either facilitate
   evolutionary rescue by allowing population recovery (a positive
   demographic effect) or impede it by relaxing selection for beneficial
   mutations required for future survival (a negative population genetic
   effect). We address this uncertainty in an experiment with populations
   of a bacteriophage virus that evolved under deteriorating conditions
   (gradually increasing temperature). Periodic environmental amelioration
   (short periods of reduced temperature) caused demographic recovery
   during the early phase of the experiment, but ultimately reduced the
   frequency of evolutionary rescue. These experimental results suggest
   that environmental fluctuations could reduce the potential of
   evolutionary rescue.}},

Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Although the effect of herbivory on plant reproduction has been
   investigated in some detail, little is known about how herbivores affect
   floral signalling. Here, we investigated the effect of foliar herbivory
   by the African Cotton Leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis) on floral
   signalling and fruit set in the White Campion (Silene latifolia). We
   found no effects of herbivory on floral traits involved in visual
   signalling (flower number, corolla diameter, calyx length, petal length)
   or in amount of nectar produced. However, Spodoptera-infested plants
   emitted higher amounts of the two floral volatiles, (Z)-3-hexenyl
   acetate and beta-ocimene, than control plants. Open pollinated, infested
   plants also were found to produce more fruits than control plants, but
   only with nocturnal pollinators. Experimental addition of the two
   induced floral volatiles to non-infested Silene flowers also led to the
   production of more fruits with nocturnal pollination. This suggests that
   higher fruit production in herbivore-infested plants was caused by
   increased nocturnal pollinator attraction, mediated by the induced
   floral emission of these two volatiles. Our results show that the
   effects of herbivory on plant reproductive success are not necessarily
   detrimental, as plants can compensate herbivory with increased
   investment in pollinator attraction.}},

Abstract = {{Climate is a main predictor of biodiversity on a global scale, yet how
   climate availability affects niche evolution remains poorly explored.
   Here we assess how intercontinental climate differences may affect the
   evolution of climate niches and suggest three possible processes: niche
   truncation along major environmental gradients, intercontinental
   differences in available climate causing differences in selective
   regimes, and niche shifts associated with long-distance dispersals
   leading to a pattern of punctuated evolution. Using the globally
   distributed danthonioid grasses, we show significant niche
   differentiation among continents and several instances of niche
   truncation. The comparison of inferred selective regimes with
   differences in available climatic space among continents demonstrates
   adaptation resulting from opportunistic evolution toward available
   climatic space. Our results suggest that niche evolution in this clade
   is punctuated, consistent with accelerated niche evolution after
   long-distance dispersal events. Finally, we discuss how intrinsic
   constraints (genetic, developmental, or functional) and biotic
   interactions could have interacted with these three processes during
   range expansion. Integrating these mechanisms could improve predictions
   for invasive taxa and long-term evolutionary responses of expanding
   clades to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade mega-events have entered a new phase of global reach,
   as post-socialist countries in Eurasia, from Poland to Russia, have or
   will become host to some of the largest events on earth: the Olympic
   Games in Sochi (2014), the Football World Cup in Russia (2018), the
   Football European Championship in Poland and Ukraine (2012), Expo in
   Astana (2017), the Asian Winter Games in Almaty (2011) and the
   Universiade in Kazan (2013), as well as a series of high-level political
   summits including the APEC and the BRICS summits in Russia. Although
   these mega-events are global, the various institutional, economic and
   cultural constellations and recombinant forms of rule that have emerged
   in their post-socialist host countries have shaped fundamentally the
   planning and organisation of each mega-event in unique ways. In each
   case, mega-events in post-socialist countries have involved a strong
   role for the central state and neopatrimonial forms of resource
   allocation. The events are meant to demonstrate to the rest of the world
   that the cities and countries once behind the Iron Curtain have at long
   last arrived in global modernity. While the rhetoric of worldwide
   competition, nationalist pride and one-upmanship between event
   organisers may be global, policies, knowledge and ideas connected to the
   events tend not to move unchanged to the post-socialist world.}},

   glacially eroded terrain were mapped, including p-forms, roches
   moutonnees, and whalebacks. Bedform long axes and plucked face
   orientations display close correlation (parallel and perpendicular) to
   palaeo-ice flow directions inferred from striae measurements. Across all
   sites, elongation ratios (length to width) varied by an order of
   magnitude between 0.8:1 and 8.4:1. Bedform properties (length, height,
   width, and long axis orientation) from four subsample areas, form
   morphometrically distinct populations, despite their close proximity and
   hypothesised similarity in palaeoglaciological conditions.
   Variations in lithology and geological structures (e.g., joint
   frequency; joint dip; joint orientation; bedding plane thickness; and
   bedding plane dip) provide lines of geological weakness, which focus the
   glacial erosion, in turn controlling bedform geometries. Determining the
   relationship (s) between bedding plane dip relative to palaeo-ice flow
   and bedform shape, relative length, amplitude, and wavelength has
   important ramifications for understanding subglacial bed roughness,
   cavity formation, and likely erosion style (quarrying and/or abrasion)
   at the ice-bed interface. This paper demonstrates a direct link between
   bedrock bedform geometries and geological structure and emphasises the
   need to understand bedrock bedform characteristics when reconstructing
   palaeoglaciological conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) are a useful tool to
   investigate the effects of inbreeding in wild populations, but are not
   informative in distinguishing between direct and indirect effects of
   heterozygosity on fitness-related traits. We tested HFCs in male Alpine
   ibex (Capra ibex) in a free-ranging population (which suffered a severe
   bottleneck at the end of the eighteenth century) and used confirmatory
   path analysis to disentangle the causal relationships between
   heterozygosity and fitness-related traits. We tested HFCs in 149 male
   individuals born between 1985 and 2009. We found that standardized
   multi-locus heterozygosity (MLH), calculated from 37 microsatellite
   loci, was related to body mass and horn growth, which are known to be
   important fitness-related traits, and to faecal egg counts (FECs) of
   nematode eggs, a proxy of parasite resistance. Then, using confirmatory
   path analysis, we were able to show that the effect of MLH on horn
   growth was not direct but mediated by body mass and FEC. HFCs do not
   necessarily imply direct genetic effects on fitness-related traits,
   which instead can be mediated by other traits in complex and unexpected
   ways.}},

   Buckle Folding: A Case Study From the Murtel Rockglacier (Switzerland)}},

Abstract = {{Rockglaciers often feature a prominent furrow-and-ridge topography.
   Previous studies suggest that this morphology develops due to
   longitudinal compressive flow during rockglacier creep; however, no
   satisfactory mechanical/physical model has been provided explaining both
   the observed characteristic wavelength and the growth rate necessary to
   amplify the structure to its final size. Our study identifies viscous
   buckle folding as the dominant process forming the furrow-and-ridge
   morphology on rockglaciers. Buckle folding is the mechanical response of
   layered viscous media to layer-parallel compression. The Murtel
   rockglacier (Switzerland) exhibits a spectacular furrow-and-ridge
   morphology and is chosen as a case study. Its well-determined internal
   structure can be approximated by two layers: the upper 3-5 m thick
   active layer consisting mainly of rock boulders and fragments above a
   thick, almost pure, ice layer, both assumed to exhibit viscous rheology.
   We analysed a high-resolution digital elevation model of the Murtel
   rockglacier using analytical buckle-folding expressions, which provide
   quantitative relationships between the observed wavelength, the layer
   thickness and the effective viscosity ratio between the folded layer and
   the underlying ice. Based on this geometrical and rheological
   information, we developed a finite-element model to simulate dynamical
   gravity-driven two-dimensional rockglacier flow. A buckling instability
   of the upper layer develops and amplifies self-consistently, reproducing
   several key features of the Murtel rockglacier (wavelength, amplitude
   and distribution of the furrow-and-ridge morphology), as well as the
   quasi-parabolic deformation profile observed in boreholes. Comparing our
   model with published surface flow velocities constrains the time
   necessary to produce the furrow-and-ridge morphology to about 1000-1500
   years. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{The influence of surface characteristics, topography and continentality
   on mountain permafrost in British Columbia}},
Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1025-1038}},
Abstract = {{Thermal and surface offsets describe mean annual ground temperature
   relative to mean annual air temperature, and for permafrost modelling
   they are often predicted as a function of surface characteristics and
   topography. As macroclimatic conditions influence the effectiveness of
   the underlying processes, knowledge of surface- and topography-specific
   offsets is not easily transferable between regions, limiting the
   applicability of empirical permafrost distribution models over areas
   with strong macroclimatic gradients.
   In this paper we describe surface and thermal offsets derived from
   distributed measurements at seven field sites in British Columbia. Key
   findings are (i) a surprisingly small variation of the surface offsets
   between different surface types; (ii) small thermal offsets at all sites
   (excluding wetlands and peat); (iii) a clear influence of the
   micro-topography at wind exposed sites (snow-cover erosion); (iv) a
   north-south difference of the surface offset of 4 degrees C in vertical
   bedrock and of 1.5-3 degrees C on open (no canopy) gentle slopes; (v)
   only small macroclimatic differences possibly caused by the inverse
   influence of snow cover and annual air temperature amplitude. These
   findings suggest that topoclimatic factors strongly influence the
   mountain permafrost distribution in British Columbia.}},

Title = {{Floral structure of Emmotum (Icacinaceae sensu stricto or Emmotaceae), a
   phylogenetically isolated genus of lamiids with a unique pseudotrimerous
   gynoecium, bitegmic ovules and monosporangiate thecae}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Icacinaceae sensu stricto consist of a group of
   early branching lineages of lamiids whose relationships are not yet
   resolved and whose detailed floral morphology is poorly known. The most
   bizarre flowers occur in Emmotum: the gynoecium has three locules on one
   side and none on the other. It has been interpreted as consisting of
   three fertile and two sterile carpels or of one fertile carpel with two
   longitudinal septa and two sterile carpels. This study focused primarily
   on the outer and inner morphology of the gynoecium to resolve its
   disputed structure, and ovule structure was also studied. In addition,
   the perianth and androecium were investigated.
   Methods Flowers and floral buds of two Emmotum species, E. harleyi and
   E. nitens, were collected and fixed in the field, and then studied by
   scanning electron microscopy. Microtome section series were used to
   reconstruct their morphology.
   Key Results The gynoecium in Emmotum was confirmed as pentamerous,
   consisting of three fertile and two sterile carpels. Each of the three
   locules behaves as the single locule in other Icacinaceae, with the
   placenta of the two ovules being identical, which shows that three
   fertile carpels are present. In addition, it was found that the ovules
   are bitegmic, which is almost unique in lamiids, and that the stamens
   have monosporangiate thecae, which also occurs in the closely related
   family Oncothecaceae, but is not known from any other Icacinaceae sensu
   lato so far.
   Conclusions The flowers of Emmotum have unique characters at different
   evolutionary levels: the pseudotrimerous gynoecium at angiosperm level,
   the bitegmic ovules at lamiid level and the monosporangiate thecae at
   family or family group level. However, in general, the floral morphology
   of Emmotum fits well in Icacinaceae. More comparative research on flower
   structure is necessary in Icacinaceae and other early branching lineages
   of lamiids to better understand the initial evolution of this large
   lineage of asterids.}},

Abstract = {{A key tool used to assess reproductive trade-offs in birds is brood size
   manipulation (BSM) experiments. Most BSM studies have examined the
   influence on short-term measures of reproductive output. Seldom
   evaluated are the effects on long-term fitness proxies under temporally
   or spatially varying environments. Unpredictable environments may affect
   reproductive trade-offs by altering the value of the brood or hampering
   optimization of reproductive effort. We reduced or enlarged broods of
   140 male Tengmalm's owls Aegolius funereus by one chick during their
   first lifetime reproductive event. Males differed in age and bred in
   environments that varied in quality spatially (habitat structure) and
   temporally (abundance of main food). We measured the short-term
   (nestling number and condition) and long-term fitness proxies (survival,
   lifetime fledgling and recruits produced) until all experimental males
   disappeared from the population. BSMs did not affect fledgling number or
   condition, but in enlarged broods, offspring condition was lower in
   territories with a high proportion of agricultural fields. Importantly,
   no obvious impacts on long-term fitness proxies emerged; lifetime
   fledgling and recruit production of males did not differ between the BSM
   treatments. Thus, the primary caregiver (i.e. Tengmalm's owl males)
   passed increased reproductive costs to their offspring, which is in
   agreement with other studies investigating intergenerational
   reproductive trade-offs in species of intermediate lifespan. Reluctance
   to accept increased current reproductive costs in these systems
   highlights the potential for sexual conflict in bi-parental care systems
   in which one of the pair is the primary caregiver.}},

Abstract = {{Spring migration of birds in many parts of the world has advanced as the
   climate has become warmer. Variation in advancement among species has
   been proposed to correlate with geography and life history features, but
   individual studies have reported variable results, and general patterns
   have been elusive. In a quantitative review of data from 389 bird
   species sampled at 69 European and 23 North American localities, we
   evaluated associations between change in the timing of migration and
   life history (body size, molt, broodedness), ecology (habitat, diet,
   nest position), and geography. We confirmed that spring migration
   advanced: -0.214 d yr(-1) (95\% CI: -0.266, -0.162) for first-arriving
   individuals and -0.104 d yr(-1) (-0.139, -0.071) for the median date of
   passage. The rate of change in autumn was more variable: 0.090 d yr(-1)
   (0.002, 0.176) delay for median passage and 0.019 d yr(-1) (-0.175,
   0.204) delay for the date of last departure. The response during spring
   was weaker in the far north and in species that migrate long distances
   to the wintering area. Autumn migration became increasingly delayed in
   species that are large-bodied, molt before departure, and that feed on
   seeds, insects, or fruits. Variation among species, especially during
   autumn, was associated in part with constraints surrounding the timing
   of the postnuptial molt. The results suggest that ecological and life
   history features of species may influence their ability to respond to
   climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Do ferns, which are physiologically less well adapted to
   conserve water than angiosperms but have more efficient propagule
   dispersal, show different vegetation-environment relationships than
   co-occurring angiosperm herbs? We hypothesized that ferns should show
   closer relationships to local environmental conditions and might be more
   closely associated with humid and shady microhabitats.
   Location: Pono and Bariri, two sites in lower montane primary tropical
   forest, Lore Lindu National Park, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.
   Methods: At each site, all terrestrial herbaceous plants were sampled in
   200 plots of 5 m 9 5 m. Sixteen environmental factors describing soils,
   topography and canopy openness were recorded. Correlations were
   calculated to test the degree of similarity in the species richness and
   turnover of ferns and angiosperms, and their relationships with
   environmental factors. Species optima were calculated on each
   environmental axis and compared between plant groups via randomization
   tests.
   Results: In total, 184 herb morphospecies were encountered at Pono and
   135 at Bariri, of which almost 60\% at each site were ferns. At both
   sites, fern species turnover showed closer correlations with soil
   variables than did angiosperm turnover. At the more topographically
   heterogeneous site (Bariri) fern species turnover was also more closely
   associated with topographic differences than was angiosperm turnover.
   Habitat preferences of ferns and angiosperms appeared more similar at
   Bariri than Pono, with both tending towards lower topographic positions
   and richer soils, but steeper slopes, than expected at random. At
   Bariri, neither plant group tended towards shady microsites, whereas at
   Pono ferns were better represented than angiosperms in microhabitats
   with open canopies.
   Conclusions: As expected, ferns showed closer correlations with
   environmental factors than angiosperm herbs. Ferns did not, however,
   consistently favour humid microhabitats at both sites, and were not
   significantly associated with shady microhabitats at either site.
   Furthermore, it appears that physiological differences in water use do
   not lead to marked divergence in fern and angiosperm herb distributions
   in the humid understorey of this lower montane rainforest.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing demand for spatially explicit assessment of multiple
   ecosystem services (ES) and remote sensing (RS) can provide valuable
   data to meet this challenge. In this study, located in the Central
   French Alps, we used high spatial and spectral resolution RS images to
   assess multiple ES based on underpinning ecosystem properties (EP) of
   subalpine grasslands. We estimated five EP (green biomass, litter mass,
   crude protein content, species diversity and soil carbon content) from
   RS data using empirical RS methods and maps of ES were calculated as
   simple linear combinations of EP. Additionally, the RS-based results
   were compared with results of a plant trait-based statistical modelling
   approach that predicted EP and ES from land use, abiotic and plant trait
   data (modelling approach). The comparison between the RS and the
   modelling approaches showed that RS-based results provided better
   insight into the fine-grained spatial distribution of EP and thereby ES,
   whereas the modelling approach reflected the land use signal that
   underpinned trait-based models of EP. The spatial agreement between the
   two approaches at a 20-m resolution varied between 16 and 22\% for
   individual EP, but for the total ecosystem service supply it was only
   7\%. Furthermore, the modelling approach identified the alpine grazed
   meadows land use class as areas with high values of multiple ES (hot
   spots) and mown-grazed permanent meadows as areas with low values and
   only few ES (cold spots). Whereas the RS-based hot spots were a small
   subset of those predicted by the modelling approach, cold spots were
   rather scattered, small patches with limited overlap with the modelling
   results. Despite limitations associated with timing of assessment
   campaigns and field data requirements, RS offers valuable data for
   spatially continuous mapping of EP and can thus supply RS-based proxies
   of ES. Although the RS approach was applied to a limited area and for
   one type of ecosystem, we believe that the broader availability of high
   fidelity airborne and satellite RS data will promote RS-based assessment
   of ES to larger areas and other ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},

Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{52-62}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Farmers are key players in actions to halt biodiversity loss from
   farmland. However, if farmers are to sustain biodiversity, they must
   first be adequately informed about biodiversity and understand its
   drivers. Measuring biodiversity at the farm scale is difficult because
   of the structural complexity of many farms, and because different
   aspects of diversity can be considered desirable, e.g. species richness
   or rarity. In this study we examined 19 grassland farms in Central
   Switzerland, and sampled plants, earthworms, spiders and bees using a
   stratified sampling design. We considered several metrics of species
   diversity, but found two particularly useful at farm scale: average
   richness (area-weighted) and farm uniqueness in terms of species
   identity. Average richness reflects the expected species richness in a
   random sample taken on the farm, and farm uniqueness is the contribution
   of a farm to the total species richness of all farms under study.
   Average richness and farm uniqueness are complementary and reflect
   different aspects of biodiversity. We demonstrate how combining these
   metrics enables tailored recommendations for enhancing species diversity
   on the farm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Causes and consequences of fine-scale population structure in a
   critically endangered freshwater seal}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Small, genetically uniform populations may face an elevated
   risk of extinction due to reduced environmental adaptability and
   individual fitness. Fragmentation can intensify these genetic
   adversities and, therefore, dispersal and gene flow among subpopulations
   within an isolated population is often essential for maintaining its
   viability. Using microsatellite and mtDNA data, we examined genetic
   diversity, spatial differentiation, interregional gene flow, and
   effective population sizes in the critically endangered Saimaa ringed
   seal (Phoca hispida saimensis), which is endemic to the large but highly
   fragmented Lake Saimaa in southeastern Finland.
   Results: Microsatellite diversity within the subspecies (H-E = 0.36)
   ranks among the lowest thus far recorded within the order Pinnipedia,
   with signs of ongoing loss of individual heterozygosity, reflecting very
   low effective subpopulation sizes. Bayesian assignment analyses of the
   microsatellite data revealed clear genetic differentiation among the
   main breeding areas, but interregional structuring was substantially
   weaker in biparentally inherited microsatellites (F-ST = 0.107) than in
   maternally inherited mtDNA (F-ST = 0.444), indicating a sevenfold
   difference in the gene flow mediated by males versus females.
   Conclusions: Genetic structuring in the population appears to arise from
   the joint effects of multiple factors, including small effective
   subpopulation sizes, a fragmented lacustrine habitat, and behavioural
   dispersal limitation. The fine-scale differentiation found in the
   landlocked Saimaa ringed seal is especially surprising when contrasted
   with marine ringed seals, which often exhibit near-panmixia among
   subpopulations separated by hundreds or even thousands of kilometres.
   Our results demonstrate that population structures of endangered animals
   cannot be predicted based on data on even closely related species or
   subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{Networks of evolving genotypes can be constructed from the worldwide
   time-resolved genotyping of pathogens like influenza viruses. Such
   genotype networks are graphs where neighbouring vertices (viral strains)
   differ in a single nucleotide or amino acid. A rich trove of network
   analysis methods can help understand the evolutionary dynamics reflected
   in the structure of these networks. Here, I analyse a genotype network
   comprising hundreds of influenza A (H3N2) haemagglutinin genes. The
   network is rife with cycles that reflect non-random parallel or
   convergent (homoplastic) evolution. These cycles also show patterns of
   sequence change characteristic for strong and local evolutionary
   constraints, positive selection and mutation-limited evolution. Such
   cycles would not be visible on a phylogenetic tree, illustrating that
   genotype network analysis can complement phylogenetic analyses. The
   network also shows a distinct modular or community structure that
   reflects temporal more than spatial proximity of viral strains, where
   lowly connected bridge strains connect different modules. These and
   other organizational patterns illustrate that genotype networks can help
   us study evolution in action at an unprecedented level of resolution.}},

   phase-to- height conversion. The hardware and processing chain were
   validated through the analysis of experimental Ka-band data. The SAR
   image resolution was measured with point targets and found to be similar
   to 2 and similar to 15 coarser than the theoretical value in range and
   azimuth, respectively. The geolocation accuracy was typically better
   than 0.1min range and 0.2 min azimuth. Observed depression
   angle-dependent interferometric phase errors were successfully removed
   using a correction function derived from the InSAR data. Investigation
   of the interferometric phase noise showed the utility of a multibaseline
   antenna setup; the number of looks and filter size used for
   theDSMgeneration were also derived from this analysis. The results
   showed that in grassland areas, the height difference between the
   similar to 2 m-resolution InSAR DSMs and the reference ALS models was 0
   +/- 0.25 m.}},

Abstract = {{Bromeliaceae is a species-rich neotropical plant family that uses a
   variety of pollinators, principally vertebrates. Tillandsia is the most
   diverse genus, and includes more than one-third of all bromeliad
   species. Within this genus, the majority of species rely on diurnal
   pollination by hummingbirds; however, the flowers of some Tillandsia
   species show some characteristics typical for pollination by nocturnal
   animals, particularly bats and moths. In this study an examination is
   made of the floral and reproductive biology of the epiphytic bromeliad
   Tillandsia macropetala in a fragment of humid montane forest in central
   Veracruz, Mexico.
   The reproductive system of the species, duration of anthesis, production
   of nectar and floral scent, as well as diurnal and nocturnal floral
   visitors and their effectiveness in pollination were determined.
   Tillandsia macropetala is a self-compatible species that achieves a
   higher fruit production through outcrossing. Nectar production is
   restricted to the night, and only nocturnal visits result in the
   development of fruits. The most frequent visitor (75 \% of visits) and
   the only pollinator of this bromeliad (in 96 \% of visits) was the
   nectarivorous bat Anoura geoffroyi (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae).
   This is the first report of chiropterophily within the genus Tillandsia.
   The results on the pollination biology of this bromeliad suggest an
   ongoing evolutionary switch from pollination by birds or moths to bats.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Understanding what environmental drivers control the position of the
   alpine tree line is important for refining our understanding of plant
   stress and tree development, as well as for climate change studies.
   However, monitoring the location of the tree line position and potential
   movement is difficult due to cost and technical challenges, as well as a
   lack of a clear boundary. Advanced remote sensing technologies such as
   Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) offer significant potential to map
   short individual tree crowns within the transition zone despite the lack
   of predictive capacity. Process-based forest growth models offer a
   complementary approach by quantifying the environmental stresses trees
   experience at the tree line, allowing transition zones to be defined and
   ultimately mapped. In this study, we investigate the role remote sensing
   and physiological, ecosystem-based modeling can play in the delineation
   of the alpine tree line. To do so, we utilize airborne LiDAR data to map
   tree height and stand density across a series of altitudinal gradients
   from below to above the tree line within the Swiss National Park (SNP),
   Switzerland. We then utilize a simple process-based model to assess the
   importance of seasonal variations on four climatically related variables
   that impose non-linear constraints on photosynthesis. Our results
   indicate that all methods predict the tree line to within a 50m
   altitudinal zone and indicate that aspect is not a driver of significant
   variations in tree line position in the region. Tree cover, rather than
   tree height is the main discriminator of the tree line at higher
   elevations. Temperatures in fall and spring are responsible for the
   major differences along altitudinal zones, however, changes in
   evaporative demand also control plant growth at lower altitudes. Our
   results indicate that the two methods provide complementary information
   on tree line location and, when combined, provide additional insights
   into potentially endangered forest/grassland transition zones.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{133-149}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The geomorphic evolution of the Makran Range of SE-Iran and SW-Pakistan
   has been controlled by the prevailing SW-Asian monsoon and Mediterranean
   winter rainfall climate and the surface uplift processes resulting from
   the Arabia-Eurasia collision. The impact of climate on Quaternary
   fluvial and alluvial sequence formation and their regional correlation
   has been little investigated due to limited age control of these
   sequences. Using Be-10 cosmogenic nuclide exposure ages we established a
   Middle to Late Pleistocene terrace chronology. Our record tentatively
   indicates that terrace levels were abandoned towards the transition to
   or during warmer/pluvial periods (interglacials and/or interstadials)
   back to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7, but abandoned ages show a large
   spread. It is hypothesized that pluvial phases correspond with times of
   enhanced SW-monsoons and a northward shift of the Intertropical
   Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Furthermore, orbital periodidties can be
   deduced on frequencies related to obliquity and precession cycles.
   Overall, caution has to be placed in sampling and interpreting alluvial
   deposits, which may have complex inheritance patterns and spatially and
   temporarily variable catchment erosion histories and terrace-channel
   dynamics.
   Beside the dominant climate control on terrace formation, elevated
   channel steepness indices around major thrusts and numerous knickpoints
   indicate an additionally tectonic influence on terrace formation. Local
   incision rates (mean similar to 0.6-0.8 min.a(-1)) are variable in space
   and time but are similar to uplift rates obtained from coastal terraces
   and thus suggest a regional surface uplift. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Syringolin A (SylA), a virulence factor secreted by certain strains of

   proteasome inhibitor imported by plant cells by an unknown transport
   process. Here, we report that functional expression in yeast of all 17

   OLIGOPEPTIDE TRANSPORTER1 (OPT1), OPT2, YELLOW STRIPE-LIKE3 (YSL3),
   YSL7, and YSL8 rendered yeast cells sensitive to growth inhibition by
   SylA to different degrees, strongly indicating that these proteins
   mediated SylA uptake into yeast cells. The greatest SylA sensitivity was
   conferred by YSL7 and YSL8 expression. An Arabidopsis ysl7 mutant
   exhibited strongly reduced SylA sensitivity in a root growth inhibition
   assay and in leaves of ysl7 and ysl8 mutants, SylA-mediated quenching of
   salicylic-acid-triggered PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE1 transcript
   accumulation was greatly reduced compared with the wild type. These
   results suggest that YSL7 and YSL8 are major SylA uptake transporters in
   Arabidopsis. Expression of a YSL homolog of bean, the host of the
   SylA-producing P. syringae pv. syringae B728a, in yeast also conferred
   strong SylA sensitivity. Thus, YSL transporters, which are thought to be
   involved in metal homeostasis, have been hijacked by bacterial pathogens
   for SylA uptake into host cells.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic diversity is one of the key evolutionary variables that
   correlate with population size, being of critical importance for
   population viability and the persistence of species. Genetic diversity
   can also have important ecological consequences within populations, and
   in turn, ecological factors may drive patterns of genetic diversity.
   However, the relationship between the genetic diversity of a population
   and how this interacts with ecological processes has so far only been
   investigated in a few studies. Here, we investigate the link between
   ecological factors, local population size, and allelic diversity, using
   a field study of a common bird species, the house sparrow (Passer
   domesticus). We studied sparrows outside the breeding season in a
   confined small valley dominated by dispersed farms and small-scale
   agriculture in southern France. Population surveys at 36 locations
   revealed that sparrows were more abundant in locations with high food
   availability. We then captured and genotyped 891 house sparrows at 10
   microsatellite loci from a subset of these locations (N=12). Population
   genetic analyses revealed weak genetic structure, where each locality
   represented a distinct substructure within the study area. We found that
   food availability was the main factor among others tested to influence
   the genetic structure between locations. These results suggest that
   ecological factors can have strong impacts on both population size per
   se and intrapopulation genetic variation even at a small scale. On a
   more general level, our data indicate that a patchy environment and low
   dispersal rate can result in fine-scale patterns of genetic diversity.
   Given the importance of genetic diversity for population viability,
   combining ecological and genetic data can help to identify factors
   limiting population size and determine the conservation potential of
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Clear-cutting is a common forest management practice, especially in
   subtropical China. However, the potential ecological consequences of
   clear-cutting remain unclear. In particular, the effect of clear-cutting
   on soil processes, such as the carbon cycle, has not been quantified in
   subtropical forests. Here, we investigated the response of soil
   respiration (Rs) to clear-cutting during a 12-month period in a
   subtropical forest in eastern China.
   We randomly selected four clear-cut (CC) plots and four corresponding
   undisturbed forest (UF) plots. Measurements of Rs were made at monthly
   time points and were combined with continuous climatic measurements in
   both CC and UF. Daily Rs was estimated by interpolating data with an
   exponential model dependent on soil temperature. Daily Rs was cumulated
   to annual Rs estimates.
   In the first year after clear-cutting, annual estimates of Rs in CC
   (50823g C m(2) yr(1)) showed no significant difference to UF plots
   (48012g C m(2) yr(1)). During the summer, soil temperatures were usually
   higher, whereas the soil volumetric water content was lower in CC than
   in UF plots. The long-term effects of clear-cutting on Rs are not
   significant, although there might be effects during the first several
   months after clear-cutting. Compared with previous work, this pattern
   was more pronounced in our subtropical forest than in the temperate and
   boreal forests that have been studied by others. With aboveground
   residuals off-site after clear-cutting, our results indicate that the
   stimulation of increasing root debris, as well as environmental changes,
   will not lead to a significant increase in Rs. In addition, long-term Rs
   will not show a significant decrease from the termination of root
   respiration, and this observation might be because of the influence of
   fast-growing vegetation after clear-cutting in situ.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of self-compatibility (SC) by the loss of
   self-incompatibility (SI) is regarded as one of the most frequent
   transitions in flowering plants. SI systems are generally characterized
   by specific interactions between the male and female specificity genes
   encoded at the S-locus. Recent empirical studies have revealed that the
   evolution of SC is often driven by male SC-conferring mutations at the
   S-locus rather than by female mutations. In this study, using a forward
   simulation model, we compared the fixation probabilities of male vs.
   female SC-conferring mutations at the S-locus. We explicitly considered
   the effects of pollen availability in the population and bias in the
   occurrence of SC-conferring mutations on the male and female specificity
   genes. We found that male SC-conferring mutations were indeed more
   likely to be fixed than were female SC-conferring mutations in a wide
   range of parameters. This pattern was particularly strong when pollen
   availability was relatively high. Under such a condition, even if the
   occurrence of mutations was biased strongly towards the female
   specificity gene, male SC-conferring mutations were much more often
   fixed. Our study demonstrates that fixation probabilities of those two
   types of mutation vary strongly depending on ecological and genetic
   conditions, although both types result in the same evolutionary
   consequencethe loss of SI.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{Sucrose transporters are essential membrane proteins for the allocation
   of carbon resources in higher plants and protein protein interactions
   play a crucial role in the post-translational regulation of sucrose
   transporters affecting affinity, transport capacity, oligomerization,
   localization, and trafficking. Systematic screening for protein
   interactors using sucrose transporters as bait proteins helped
   identifying several proteins binding to sucrose transporters from apple,
   Arabidopsis, potato, or tomato using the split ubiguitin system. This
   mini-review summarizes known sucrose transporter-interacting proteins
   and their potential function in plants. Not all of the identified
   interaction partners are postulated to be located at the plasma
   membrane, but some are predicted to be endoplasmic reticulum-residing
   proteins such as a protein disulfide isomerase and members of the
   cytochrome b5 family. Many of the SUT1-interacting proteins are
   secretory proteins or involved in metabolism. Identification of actin
   and actin-related proteins as SUT1-interacting proteins confirmed the
   observation that movement of SUT1-containing intracellular vesicles can
   be blocked by inhibition of actin polymerization using specific
   inhibitors. Manipulation of expression of these interacting proteins
   represents one possible way to modify resource allocation by
   post-translational regulation of sucrose transporters.}},

Abstract = {{Colloids (ex. nanoparticles) may be relevant in contaminant migration in
   groundwater if the contaminant is strongly adsorbed onto colloids and
   they are stable in the environment.
   An integrated study of Se(IV) sorption and TiO2 colloid stability was
   performed in this work. This integrated study includes the experimental
   analysis and modelling of Se(IV) sorption onto TiO2 particle surface and
   the evaluation of the influence of adsorbed Se(IV) on TiO2 stability.
   Results indicated that low ionic strength and acid pH favour both high
   Se(IV) sorption and TiO2 colloid stability. However, at medium-high
   surface occupancy, sorbed Se(IV) highly affected TiO2 colloid stability.
   Anion adsorption decreases the positive surface charge shifting the TiO2
   isoelectric point, thus promoting particle aggregation under acid pH.
   Nevertheless, the application of the single particle counting technique
   allowed determination of the presence of a significant fraction of TiO2
   nanoparticles which are highly susceptible to migrate even under
   favourable conditions for aggregation. Therefore, although part of the
   TiO2 is disabled for migration by sorbed Se at acid conditions, still a
   considerable percentage that remains disaggregated could move together
   with Se. The developed Se(IV) sorption model can inform about the extent
   and type of sorption under specific geochemical conditions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Earthworms are among the world's most important ecosystem engineers
   because of their effects on soil fertility and plant productivity. Their
   dependence on plants for carbon, however, means that any changes in
   plant community structure or function caused by rising atmospheric CO2
   or loss of plant species diversity could affect earthworm activity,
   which may feed back on plant communities. Production of surface casts
   measured during three consecutive years in field experimental plots (n =
   24, 1.2 m(2)) planted with local calcareous grassland species that
   varied in plant species richness (diversity levels: high, 31 species;
   medium, 12; low, 5) and were exposed to ambient (356 mu l CO2 l(-1)) or
   elevated (600 mu l CO2 l(-1)) CO2 was only consistently stimulated in
   high diversity plots exposed to elevated CO2 (+120 \%, 31 spp: 603 +/- A
   52 under ambient CO2 vs. 1,325 +/- A 204 g cast dwt. m(-2) year(-1)
   under elevated CO2 in 1996; +77 \%, 940 +/- A 44 vs. 1,663 +/- A 204 g
   cast dwt. m(-2) year(-1) in 1998). Reductions in plant diversity had
   little effect on cast production in ecosystems maintained at ambient
   CO2, but the stimulatory effect of elevated CO2 on cast production
   disappeared when plant species diversity was decreased to 12 and 5
   species. High diversity plots were also the only communities that
   included plant species that an earlier field study showed to be among
   the most responsive to elevated CO2 and to be most preferred by
   earthworms to deposit casts near. Further, the +87 \% CO2-induced
   increase in cast production measured over the 3 years corresponded to a
   parallel increase in cumulative total nitrogen of 5.7 g N m(-2) and
   would help explain the large stimulation of aboveground plant biomass
   production observed in high-diversity communities under elevated CO2.
   The results of this study demonstrate how the loss of plant species from
   communities can alter responses of major soil heterotrophs and
   consequently ecosystem biogeochemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal generations of short-lived organisms often differ in their
   morphological, behavioural and life history traits, including body size.
   These differences may be either due to immediate effects of seasonally
   variable environment on organisms (responsive plasticity) or rely on
   presumably adaptive responses of organisms to cues signalizing
   forthcoming seasonal changes (anticipatory plasticity). When directly
   developing individuals of insects are larger than their overwintering
   conspecifics, the between-generation differences are typically ascribed
   to responsive plasticity in larval growth. We tested this hypothesis
   using the papilionid butterly Iphiclides podalirius as a model species.
   In laboratory experiments, we demonstrated that seasonal differences in
   food quality could not explain the observed size difference. Similarly,
   the size differences are not likely to be explained by the immediate
   effects of ambient temperature and photoperiod on larval growth. The
   qualitative pattern of natural size differences between the directly
   developing and diapausing butterflies could be reproduced in the
   laboratory as a response to photoperiod, indicating anticipatory
   character of the response. Directly developing and diapausing
   individuals followed an identical growth trajectory until the end of the
   last larval instar, with size differences appearing just a few days
   before pupation. Taken together, various lines of evidence suggest that
   between-generation size differences in I. podalirius are not caused by
   immediate effects of environmental factors on larval growth. Instead,
   these differences rather represent anticipatory plasticity and are thus
   likely to have an adaptive explanation. It remains currently unclear,
   whether the seasonal differences in adult size per se are adaptive, or
   if they constitute co-product of processes related to the diapause. Our
   study shows that it may be feasible to distinguish between different
   types of plasticity on the basis of empirical data even if fitness
   cannot be directly measured, and contributes to the emerging view about
   the predominantly adaptive nature of seasonal polyphenisms in insects.}},

Title = {{A method for determining weights for excess relative risk and excess
   absolute risk when applied in the calculation of lifetime risk of cancer
   from radiation exposure}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Radiation-related risks of cancer can be transported from one population
   to another population at risk, for the purpose of calculating lifetime
   risks from radiation exposure. Transfer via excess relative risks (ERR)
   or excess absolute risks (EAR) or a mixture of both (i.e., from the life
   span study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors) has been done in the
   past based on qualitative weighting. Consequently, the values of the
   weights applied and the method of application of the weights (i.e., as
   additive or geometric weighted means) have varied both between reports
   produced at different times by the same regulatory body and also between
   reports produced at similar times by different regulatory bodies. Since
   the gender and age patterns are often markedly different between EAR and
   ERR models, it is useful to have an evidence-based method for
   determining the relative goodness of fit of such models to the data.
   This paper identifies a method, using Akaike model weights, which could
   aid expert judgment and be applied to help to achieve consistency of
   approach and quantitative evidence-based results in future health risk
   assessments. The results of applying this method to recent LSS cancer
   incidence models are that the relative EAR weighting by cancer solid
   cancer site, on a scale of 0-1, is zero for breast and colon, 0.02 for
   all solid, 0.03 for lung, 0.08 for liver, 0.15 for thyroid, 0.18 for
   bladder and 0.93 for stomach. The EAR weighting for female breast cancer
   increases from 0 to 0.3, if a generally observed change in the trend
   between female age-specific breast cancer incidence rates and attained
   age, associated with menopause, is accounted for in the EAR model.
   Application of this method to preferred models from a study of
   multi-model inference from many models fitted to the LSS leukemia
   mortality data, results in an EAR weighting of 0. From these results it
   can be seen that lifetime risk transfer is most highly weighted by EAR
   only for stomach cancer. However, the generalization and interpretation
   of radiation effect estimates based on the LSS cancer data, when
   projected to other populations, are particularly uncertain if
   considerable differences exist between site-specific baseline rates in
   the LSS and the other populations of interest. Definitive conclusions,
   regarding the appropriate method for transporting cancer risks, are
   limited by a lack of knowledge in several areas including unknown
   factors and uncertainties in biological mechanisms and genetic and
   environmental risk factors for carcinogenesis; uncertainties in
   radiation dosimetry; and insufficient statistical power and/or
   incomplete follow-up in data from radio-epidemiological studies.}},

Journal = {{DENDROCHRONOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{97-104}},
Abstract = {{Permafrost and related landforms (rockglaciers) are widespread phenomena
   in alpine geosystems. In the context of changing environments due to the
   significant warming, there is a need for thorough monitoring and
   analyzing the complex responses of these cryospheric geosystems. Here,
   the first-time application of wood anatomical methods in this context is
   presented in order to investigate whether rockglacier movement is
   reflected in varying cell structures of plants growing on top of the
   rockglaciers.
   In order to determine the influence of ground movements (by permafrost
   creep) and their influence on the conductive elements within roots of
   plants, wood-samples were taken from active and inactive rockglaciers in
   the Turtmann Valley, southern Swiss Alps. Since the occurrence of trees
   is limited altitudinally, the investigation was restricted to Swiss
   willow shrubs (Salix helvetica) frequently growing in permafrost areas
   above the timberline in the European Alps. This rather new approach
   concentrates on general vessel size differences as a result of
   mechanical stresses. The comparison of vessel sizes in roots of Swiss
   willow shrubs growing on active and inactive permafrost bodies depicts
   differences within the roots, which are related to the activity status
   of the respective rockglacier creep. (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{For rural and natural scenes, synthetic aperture radar interferometry
   (InSAR) has long been an operational technique for the generation of

   areas has become an increasingly important research topic. Due to the
   complexity of this kind of scenes, however, advanced interferometric
   techniques have to be employed. While usually satellite-borne stacks of
   multi-temporal data are collected in order to make use of differential
   SAR interferometry or the increasingly popular persistent scatterer
   technique, this article aims at the utilization of an airborne
   single-pass multi-baseline system working in the millimetrewave domain.
   Starting from the description of the exemplary German MEMPHIS sensor,
   the complete processing chain from the collection of necessary
   navigation data over the focusing of the raw SAR data to finally the

   carbon fixation (or gross primary production, GPP) is crucial to our
   understanding of the global carbon cycle and the impact of climate
   change. Besides spatial, seasonal and interannual variations, GPP also
   exhibits strong diurnal variations. Satellite retrieved solar-induced
   chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides a spatially continuous, but
   temporally discrete measurement of plant photosynthesis, and has the
   potential to be used to estimate GPP at global scale. However, it
   remains unclear whether the seasonal time series of SIF snapshots taken
   at a fixed time of the day can be used to infer daily total GPP
   variation at spatial and seasonal scales. In this study, we first used
   GPP estimates from 135 eddy covariance flux sites, covering a wide range
   of geographic locations and biome types, to investigate the relationship
   between the instantaneous GPP (GPP(inst)) and daily GPP (GPP(daily)) on
   the seasonal course for different times of the day. Latitudinal and
   diurnal patterns were found to correspond to variations in
   photo-synthetically active radiation (PAR) and light use efficiency
   (LUE), respectively. We then used the Soil-Canopy Observation
   Photosynthesis and Energy Balance (SCOPE) model and the FluxCom GPP
   product to investigate the instantaneous and daily SIF-GPP relationships
   at five flux tower sites along a latitudinal gradient and at a global
   scale for different biome types. The results showed that daily SIF had a
   stronger linear correlation with daily GPP than instantaneous SIF at the
   seasonal scale, with an instantaneous to daily SIF conversion factor
   following the latitudinal and seasonal pattern driven by PAR. Our study
   highlights the necessity to take the latitudinal and diurnal factors
   into consideration for SIF-GPP relationship analyses or for
   physiological phenology analyses based on SIF.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition has aroused large concerns because of
   its potential negative effects on forest ecosystems. Although
   microorganisms play a vital role in ecosystem carbon (C) and nutrient
   cycling, the effect of N deposition on soil microbiota still remains
   unclear. In this study, we investigated the responses of microbial
   biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN) and microbial community composition to 4-5
   years of experimentally simulated N deposition in temperate needle-leaf
   forests and subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests in eastern China,
   using chloroform fumigation extraction and phospholipid fatty acid
   (PLFA) methods. We found idiosyncratic effects of N addition on
   microbial biomass in these two types of forest ecosystems. In the
   subtropical forests, N addition showed a significant negative effect on
   microbial biomass and community composition, while the effect of N
   addition was not significant in the temperate forests. The N addition
   decreased MBC, MBN, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and the F/B ratio
   (ratio of fungi to bacteria biomass) in the subtropical forests, likely
   due to a decreased soil pH and changes in the plant community
   composition. These results showed that microbial biomass and community
   composition in subtropical forests, compared with the temperate forests,
   were sensitive to N deposition. Our findings suggest that N deposition
   may have negative influence on soil microorganisms and potentially alter
   carbon and nutrient cycling in subtropical forests, rather than in
   temperate forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The spring phenology of plants in temperate regions strongly responds to
   spring temperatures. Climate warming has caused substantial phenological
   advances in the past, but trends to be expected in the future are
   uncertain. A simple indicator is temperature sensitivity, the
   phenological advance statistically associated with a 1 degrees C warmer
   mean temperature during the preseason{''}, defined as the most
   temperature-sensitive period preceding the phenological event. Recent
   analyses of phenological records have shown a decline in temperature
   sensitivity of leaf unfolding, but underlying mechanisms were not clear.
   Here, we propose that climate warming can reduce temperature sensitivity
   simply by reducing the length of the preseason due to faster bud
   development during this time period, unless the entire preseason shifts
   forward so that its temperature does not change. We derive these
   predictions theoretically from the widely used thermal time model for
   bud development and test them using data for 19 phenological events
   recorded in 1970-2012 at 108 stations spanning a 1600 m altitudinal
   range in Switzerland. We consider how temperature sensitivity, preseason
   start, preseason length and preseason temperature change (i) with
   altitude, (ii) between the periods 1970-1987 and 1995-2012, which
   differed mainly in spring temperatures, and (iii) between two
   non-consecutive sets of 18 years that differed mainly in winter
   temperatures. On average, temperature sensitivity increased with
   altitude (colder climate) and was reduced in years with warmer springs,
   but not in years with warmer winters. These trends also varied among
   species. Decreasing temperature sensitivity in warmer springs was
   associated with a limited forward shift of preseason start, higher
   temperatures during the preseason and reduced preseason length, but not
   with reduced winter chilling. Our results imply that declining
   temperature sensitivity can result directly from spring warming and does
   not necessarily indicate altered physiological responses or stronger
   constraints such as reduced winter chilling.}},

Title = {{Enhancing plant diversity in agricultural landscapes promotes both rare
   bees and dominant crop-pollinating bees through complementary increase
   in key floral resources}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1856-1864}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Enhancing key floral resources is essential to effectively mitigate
   the loss of pollinator diversity and associated provisioning of
   pollination functions in agro-ecosystems. However, effective floral
   provisioning measures may diverge among different pollinator
   conservation targets, such as the conservation of rare species or the
   promotion of economically important crop pollinators. We examined to
   what extent such diverging conservation goals could be reconciled.
   2. We analysed plant-bee visitation networks of 64 herbaceous
   semi-natural habitats representing a gradient of plant species richness
   to identify key resource plants of the three distinct conservation
   target groups: rare bees (of conservation concern), dominant wild
   crop-pollinating bees and managed crop-pollinating bees (i.e.
   honeybees).
   3. Considering overall flower visitation, rare bees tended to visit
   nested subsets of plant species that were also visited by crop
   pollinators (46\% and 77\% nestedness in the dissimilarity between rare
   bees and wild crop pollinators or managed honeybees respectively).
   However, the set of preferred plant species, henceforth key plant
   species' (i.e. those species disproportionately more visited than
   expected according to their floral abundance) was considerably more
   distinct and less nested among bee target groups.
   4. Flower visits of all bee target groups increased with plant species
   richness at a similar rate. Importantly, our analyses revealed that an
   exponential increase in the flower abundance of the identified key plant
   species and complementarity in the bee visitation pattern across plant
   species - rather than total flower abundance - were the major drivers of
   these relationships.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that the multiple goals of
   preserving high bee diversity, conserving rare species and sustaining
   crop pollinators can be reconciled if key plant species of different
   target groups are simultaneously available. This availability is
   facilitated by a high floral resource complementarity in the plant
   community. The list of identified key resource plant species we provide
   here can help practitioners such as land managers and conservationists
   to better design and evaluate pollinator conservation and restoration
   measures according to their goals. Our findings highlight the importance
   of identifying and promoting such plant species for pollinator
   conservation in agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing frequency of extreme climatic events can disrupt ecosystem
   processes and destabilize ecosystem functioning. Biodiversity may dampen
   these negative effects of environmental perturbations to provide greater
   ecosystem stability. We assessed the effects of plant diversity on the
   resistance, recovery and stability of experimental grassland ecosystems
   in response to recurring summer drought over 7 yr. Plant biomass
   production was reduced during the summer drought treatment compared with
   control plots. However, the negative effect of drought was relatively
   less pronounced at high than at low plant diversity, demonstrating that
   biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance to environmental
   perturbation. Furthermore, more diverse plant communities compensated
   for the reduced productivity during drought by increasing spring
   productivity compared to control plots. The drought-induced compensatory
   recovery led to increased short-term variations in productivity across
   growing seasons in more diverse communities that stabilized the
   longer-term productivity across years. Our findings show that short-term
   variation between seasons in the face of environmental perturbation can
   lead to longer-term stability of annual productivity in diverse
   ecosystems compared to less diverse ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of wildlife populations due to emerging infectious disease
   often shows a common pattern: the parasite invades a naive host
   population, producing epidemic disease and a population decline,
   sometimes with extirpation. Some susceptible host populations can
   survive the epidemic phase and persist with endemic parasitic infection.
   Understanding host-parasite dynamics leading to persistence of the
   system is imperative to adequately inform conservation practice. Here we
   combine field data, statistical and mathematical modelling to explore
   the dynamics of the apparently stable Rhinoderma
   darwinii-Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) system. Our results
   indicate that Bd-induced population extirpation may occur even in the
   absence of epidemics and where parasite prevalence is relatively low.
   These empirical findings are consistent with previous theoretical
   predictions showing that highly pathogenic parasites are able to
   regulate host populations even at extremely low prevalence, highlighting
   that disease threats should be investigated as a cause of population
   declines even in the absence of an overt increase in mortality.}},

Title = {{Snow redistribution for the hydrological modeling of alpine catchments}},

Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Modeling snow redistribution by wind and avalanches in hydrological
   studies in alpine catchments is important, as the spatial variability of
   the snow cover has an impact on timing and magnitude of the snowmelt
   runoff. Disregarding snow redistribution in models can lead to the
   formation of `snow towers,' i.e., multi-year accumulation of snow at
   high elevations and an incorrect water balance. The reviewed approaches
   to deal with snow redistribution in hydrological models were first
   broadly grouped by the represented physical processes: (1) the
   correction of the precipitation input data to account mainly for
   preferential deposition, (2) the description of all wind-driven
   processes based on wind field data, (3) the description of gravitational
   transports and/or wind-driven processes based on topographic
   information, and (4) the statistical description of the variability of
   the snow water equivalent (SWE) to account for all types of snow
   redistribution. The review further assessed the implementation of these
   approaches in physically based and bucket-type hydrological models.
   Generally, snow redistribution consideration has improved the simulation
   of snow patterns and SWE and consequently the prediction of discharge in
   mountain catchments worldwide. Snow redistribution approaches still have
   some limitations and a large gap exists between the knowledge and
   processes in highly detailed physically based snow models and the widely
   used bucket-type hydrological models used for water resources and
   climate change studies. There is a real need to bridge this gap using
   the knowledge earned by snow redistribution modeling with established
   physically based models to develop more conceptual approaches for the
   application in bucket-type models. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Determination of grassland use intensity based on multi-temporal remote

Abstract = {{Grassland use intensity and its impact on biodiversity and water
   pollution is a topic of growing interest. In ecological studies,
   intensity of use has been assessed by means of three indicators: i)
   mowing frequency, ii) grazing intensity, and iii) fertilization input. A
   multidimensional approach is key for the understanding of
   intensification effects in terrestrial and water ecosystems. Remote
   sensing is a powerful tool to monitor management indicators.
   Nevertheless, interdependencies between remote sensing methods and
   between indicators require new approaches to assess intensity of use.
   The objective of this study is to monitor ecological indicators of land
   use intensity based on multispectral imagery using a multidimensional
   approach. We performed a multi-temporal analysis using a series of
   RapidEye images within a growing season in the Canton of Zurich,
   Switzerland, in 2013. We defined mowing frequency classes distinguishing
   spectral changes between pairs of images. The analysis of the whole
   image sequence within the growing season helped differentiate grazing
   intensities. Furthermore, we analysed the suitability of modelled
   livestock density based on remote sensing derived products to determine
   fertilizer input. Three grassland management practices were
   distinguished: i) medium intensive (46\%), ii) low intensive (37\%), and
   iii) high intensive (17\%). We discuss the combination of high mowing
   frequency and fields with high grazing intensity to define areas prone
   to nutrient surpluses. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimation of
   interrelated indicators of grassland use intensity could be carried out
   preserving independence between methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc All

Abstract = {{In this paper, the scientific outcomes of the 2016 Data Fusion Contest
   organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee of
   the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society are discussed. The 2016
   Contest was an open topic competition based on a multitemporal and
   multimodal dataset, which included a temporal pair of very high
   resolution panchromatic and multispectral Deimos-2 images and a video
   captured by the Iris camera on-board the International Space Station.
   The problems addressed and the techniques proposed by the participants
   to the Contest spanned across a rather broad range of topics, and mixed
   ideas and methodologies from the remote sensing, video processing, and
   computer vision. In particular, the winning team developed a deep
   learning method to jointly address spatial scene labeling and temporal
   activity modeling using the available image and video data. The second
   place team proposed a random field model to simultaneously perform
   coregistration of multitemporal data, semantic segmentation, and change
   detection. The methodological key ideas of both these approaches and the
   main results of the corresponding experimental validation are discussed
   in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In order to combat global warming, Italy has committed to reduce its CO2
   emissions. To this end, it has significantly encouraged renewable energy
   development through a variety of support schemes, ranging from green
   certificates to feed-in and premium tariffs. Asa result, the production
   of electricity from renewable energy sources, in particular from solar
   and wind energy, has risen considerably over the past years. In this
   paper we review the Italian support schemes for wind and solar energy
   and estimate the cost of abating CO2 emissions by generating electricity
   from these two sources of energy for the period 2008-2011. The results
   show that the average costs for wind were around 165 (sic)/tCO(2). For
   solar, they were much higher, around 1000 (sic)/tCO(2), as solar energy
   received much higher remunerations than wind energy. These costs were
   much higher than in Germany. This was due to the differences between the
   level of incentives and the different power systems.}},

Abstract = {{Migrating birds have to incorporate migration into their annual cycle,
   next to breeding and moult. This presents the challenge to arrive at the
   right place at the right time at any given moment during the year to
   maximize fitness. Although many studies have investigated the timing of
   specific (life-history) activities of migrating birds, it is poorly
   studied how the timing and duration of these activities depend on each
   other and, ultimately, how they affect fitness. Therefore, we
   investigated variability and dependencies in the timing and duration of
   successive activities throughout the annual cycle and assessed their
   fitness consequences in hoopoes (Upupa epops), a long-distance migratory
   bird, using geolocator and breeding phenology data of five consecutive
   years. We found that the timing and duration of seasonal activities
   generally depended on the timing and duration of the preceding activity;
   yet, the strength of these dependencies and the degree of variability
   varied between activities. The strongest dependencies were found between
   the end of breeding and departure from the breeding grounds as well as
   between the arrival in the breeding grounds and the onset of breeding.
   We also found fitness consequences of timing and duration but only for
   specific activities: spring migration and particularly the duration of
   the pre-breeding period influenced the quality of the territory acquired
   as well as the total number of fledglings. Consequently, we suggest that
   our study species has the flexibility to adjust the timing and duration
   of activities but to varying degrees. This is a step forward in
   understanding the time-constraints that migratory animals face and in
   identifying their fitness consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Fine mapping of Yr47 and Lr52 in chromosome arm 5BS of wheat identified
   close linkage of the marker sun180 to both genes and its robustness for
   marker-assisted selection was demonstrated.
   The widely effective and genetically linked rust resistance genes Yr47
   and Lr52 have previously been mapped in the short arm of chromosome 5B
   in two F-3 populations (Aus28183/Aus27229 and Aus28187/Aus27229). The
   Aus28183/Aus27229 F-3 population was advanced to generate an F-6
   recombinant inbred line (RIL) population to identify markers closely
   linked with Yr47 and Lr52. Diverse genomic resources including
   flow-sorted chromosome survey sequence contigs representing the
   orthologous region in Brachypodium distachyon, the physical map of
   chromosome arm 5BS, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) located in the
   5BS6-0.81-1.00 deletion bin and resistance gene analog contigs of
   chromosome arm 5BS were used to develop markers to saturate the target
   region. Selective genotyping was also performed using the iSelect 90 K
   Infinium wheat SNP assay. A set of SSR, STS, gene-based and SNP markers
   were developed and genotyped on the Aus28183/Aus27229 RIL population.
   Yr47 and Lr52 are genetically distinct genes that mapped 0.4 cM apart in
   the RIL population. The SSR marker sun180 co-segregated with Lr52 and
   mapped 0.4 cM distal to Yr47. In a high resolution mapping population of
   600 F-2 genotypes Yr47 and Lr52 mapped 0.2 cM apart and marker sun180
   was placed 0.4 cM distal to Lr52. The amplification of a different
   sun180 amplicon (195 bp) than that linked with Yr47 and Lr52 (200 bp) in
   204 diverse wheat genotypes demonstrated its robustness for
   marker-assisted selection of these genes.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we present a comprehensive assessment of Siachen Glacier (East
   Karakoram), in terms of its area and elevation change, velocity
   variations and mass budget, utilizing different satellite datasets
   including Landsat, Hexagon, Cartosat-I, Shuttle Radar Topography
   Mission, Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar and Japanese Advanced
   Land Observing Satellite Phased Array-type L-band SAR. The total areal
   extent of Siachen Glacier did not change significantly between 1980 and
   2014; however the exposed-ice area decreased during that period. The
   terminus of the glacier has experienced substantial downwasting (on
   average 30 m) over the period of 1999-2007, followed by a retreat of the
   transition between exposed and debris-covered ice by a distance of 1.3
   km during the short span 2007-14. The spatial patterns of the elevation
   difference and velocity are heterogeneous over the large areal extent of
   Siachen Glacier. The average velocity of the entire glacier, as computed
   between 11 December 2008 and 26 January 2009, was 12.3 +/- 0.4 cm d(-1),
   while those estimated separately for the accumulation and ablation
   regions were 9.7 +/- 0.4 cm d(-1) and 20.4 +/- 0.4 cm d(-1),
   respectively. The mass budget of Siachen Glacier is estimated to be
   -0.03 +/- 0.21 m w.e. a(-1) for the period of 1999-2007.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of Quaternary climatic oscillations on the demography of
   organisms vary across regions and continents. In taxa distributed in
   Europe and North America, several paradigms regarding the distribution
   of refugia have been identified. By contrast, less is known about the
   processes that shaped the species' spatial genetic structure in areas
   such as the Himalayas, which is considered a biodiversity hotspot. Here,
   we investigated the phylogeographic structure and population dynamics of
   Primula tibetica by combining genomic phylogeography and species
   distribution models (SDMs). Genomic data were obtained for 293 samples
   of P.tibetica using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq).
   Ensemble SDMs were carried out to predict potential present and past
   distribution ranges. Four distinct lineages were identified. Approximate
   Bayesian computation analyses showed that each of them have experienced
   both expansions and bottlenecks since their divergence, which occurred
   during or across the Quaternary glacial cycles. The two lineages at both
   edges of the distribution were found to be more vulnerable and responded
   in different ways to past climatic changes. These results illustrate how
   past climatic changes affected the demographic history of Himalayan
   organisms. Our findings highlight the significance of combining genomic
   approaches with environmental data when evaluating the effects of past
   climatic changes.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores two pre-eminent features of transnational media
   coverage of climate change: The framing of climate change as a harmful,
   human-induced risk and the way that reporting handles contrarian voices
   in the climate debate. The analysis shows how journalists, and their
   interpretations and professional norms, shape media debates about
   climate change. The study links an analysis of media content to a survey
   of the authors of the respective articles. It covers leading print and
   online news outlets in Germany, India, the United Kingdom, the United
   States, and Switzerland. It finds that climate journalism has moved
   beyond the norm of balance towards a more interpretive pattern of
   journalism. Quoting contrarian voices still is part of transnational
   climate coverage, but these quotes are contextualized with a dismissal
   of climate change denial. Yet niches of denial persist in certain
   contexts, and much journalistic attention is focused on the narrative of
   `warners vs. deniers,' and overlooks the more relevant debates about
   climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main environmental threats in the tropics is selective
   logging, which has degraded large areas of forest. In southeast Asia,
   enrichment planting with seedlings of the dominant group of dipterocarp
   tree species aims to accelerate restoration of forest structure and
   functioning. The role of tree diversity in forest restoration is still
   unclear, but the `insurance hypothesis' predicts that in temporally and
   spatially varying environments planting mixtures may stabilize
   functioning owing to differences in species traits and ecologies. To
   test for potential insurance effects, we analyse the patterns of
   seedling mortality and growth in monoculture and mixture plots over the
   first decade of the Sabah biodiversity experiment. Our results reveal
   the species differences required for potential insurance effects
   including a trade-off in which species with denser wood have lower
   growth rates but higher survival. This trade-offwas consistent over time
   during the first decade, but growth and mortality varied spatially
   across our 500 ha experiment with species responding to changing
   conditions in different ways. Overall, average survival rates were
   extreme in monocultures than mixtures consistent with a potential
   insurance effect in which monocultures of poorly surviving species risk
   recruitment failure, whereas monocultures of species with high survival
   have rates of self-thinning that are potentially wasteful when seedling
   stocks are limited. Longer-term monitoring as species interactions
   strengthen will be needed to more comprehensively test to what degree
   mixtures of species spread risk and use limited seedling stocks more
   efficiently to increase diversity and restore ecosystem structure and
   functioning.}},

Title = {{Effects of biodiversity strengthen over time as ecosystem functioning

Abstract = {{Human-caused declines in biodiversity have stimulated intensive research
   on the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem services and
   policy initiatives to preserve the functioning of ecosystems. Short-term
   biodiversity experiments have documented positive effects of plant
   species richness on many ecosystem functions, and longer-term studies
   indicate, for some ecosystem functions, that biodiversity effects can
   become stronger over time. Theoretically, a biodiversity effect can
   strengthen over time by an increasing performance of high-diversity
   communities, by a decreasing performance of low-diversity communities,
   or a combination of both processes. Which of these two mechanisms
   prevail, and whether the increase in the biodiversity effect over time
   is a general property of many functions remains currently unclear. These
   questions are an important knowledge gap as a continuing decline in the
   performance of low-diversity communities would indicate an
   ecosystem-service debt resulting from delayed effects of species loss on
   ecosystem functioning. Conversely, an increased performance of
   high-diversity communities over time would indicate that the benefits of
   biodiversity are generally underestimated in short-term studies.
   Analyzing 50 ecosystem variables over 11 years in the world's largest
   grassland biodiversity experiment, we show that overall plant diversity
   effects strengthened over time. Strengthening biodiversity effects were
   independent of the considered compartment (above- or belowground),
   organizational level (ecosystem variables associated with the abiotic
   habitat, primary producers, or higher trophic levels such as herbivores
   and pollinators), and variable type (measurements of pools or rates). We
   found evidence that biodiversity effects strengthened because of both a
   progressive decrease in functioning in species-poor and a progressive
   increase in functioning in species-rich communities. Our findings
   provide evidence that negative feedback effects at low biodiversity are
   as important for biodiversity effects as complementarity among species
   at high biodiversity. Finally, our results indicate that a current loss
   of species will result in a future impairment of ecosystem functioning,
   potentially decades beyond the moment of species extinction.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report the outcomes of the 2015 data fusion contest
   organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee
   (IADF TC) of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society. As for
   previous years, the IADF TC organized a data fusion contest aiming at
   fostering new ideas and solutions for multisource studies. The 2015
   edition of the contest proposed a multiresolution and multisensorial
   challenge involving extremely high resolution RGB images (with a ground
   sample distance of 5 cm) and a 3-D light detection and ranging point
   cloud (with a point cloud density of approximatively 65 pts/m(2)). The
   competition was framed in two parallel tracks, considering 2-D and 3-D
   products, respectively. In this Part B, we report the results obtained
   by the winners of the 3-D contest, which explored challenging tasks of
   road extraction and ISO containers identification, respectively. The 2-D
   part of the contest and a detailed presentation of the dataset are
   discussed in Part A.}},

Abstract = {{Theories for the evolution of sex rarely include facultatively sexual
   reproduction. Sexual harassment by males is an underappreciated factor:
   it should at first sight increase the relative advantage of asexual
   reproduction by increasing the cost of sex. However, if the same females
   can perform either sexual or asexual life cycles, then females trying to
   reproduce asexually may not escape harassment. If resisting male
   harassment is costly, it might be beneficial for a female to accept a
   mating and undertake a sexual life cycle rather than `insist' on an
   asexual one. We investigate the effects of sexual harassment on the
   maintenance of sex under different population densities. Our model shows
   that resisting matings pays off at low population densities, which leads
   to the complete extinction of males, and thus to the evolution of
   completely asexual populations. Facultative sex persists in a narrow
   range of slightly higher densities. At high densities, selection favours
   giving up resisting male mating attempts and thus sexual reproduction
   takes over. These interactions between the outcomes of sexual conflict
   and population density suggest an explanation for the rarity of
   facultative sex and also patterns of geographical parthenogenesis, where
   marginal environments with potentially low densities are associated with
   asexuality.}},

Abstract = {{Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form an epigenetic memory system in plants
   and animals, but interacting proteins are poorly known in plants. Here,
   we have identified Arabidopsis UBIQUITIN SPECIFIC PROTEASES (USP; UBP in
   plant and yeasts) 12 and 13 as partners of the plant-specific PcG
   protein LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1). UBP12 binds to chromatin
   of PcG target genes and is required for histone H3 lysine 27
   trimethylation and repression of a subset of PcG target genes. Plants
   lacking UBP12 and UBP13 developed autonomous endosperm in the absence of
   fertilization. We have identified UBP12 and UBP13 as new proteins in the
   plant PcG regulatory network. UBP12 and UBP13 belong to an ancient gene
   family and represent plant homologues of metazoan USP7. We have found
   that Drosophila USP7 shares a function in heterochromatic gene
   repression with UBP12/13 and their homologue UBP26. In summary, we
   demonstrate that USP7-like proteins are essential for gene silencing in
   diverse genomic contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Abundant occurrences of the palynomorph Reduviasporonites have been
   described as ``fungal spike{''} from several Permian/Triassic boundary
   sections and related to the supposed destruction of woody vegetation by
   fungal pathogens during the Permian/Friassic extinction event. The
   biological affinity of this taxa considered by some authors of fungal
   origin is still controversially discussed since there is geochemical
   evidence that it is most probably related to algae. The abundance peak
   of this species is used by some authors as a stratigraphic marker,
   notably in terrestrial Permian/Triassic boundary sections from South
   China. Illustrations of the reported fungal remains however show
   potentially erroneous taxonomic identification of Reduviasporonites,
   and, based on differences in thermal maturation, they may represent
   recent contamination. Here Reduviasporonites chalastus of Early Triassic
   age is illustrated together with recent fungal remains originating from
   a strongly weathered and otherwise barren sample from a Middle Triassic
   section. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between floral traits and reproductive isolation is
   crucial to explaining the extraordinary diversity of angiosperms.
   Heterostyly, a complex floral polymorphism that optimizes outcrossing,
   evolved repeatedly and has been shown to accelerate diversification in
   primroses, yet its potential influence on isolating mechanisms remains
   unexplored. Furthermore, the relative contribution of pre-versus
   postmating barriers to reproductive isolation is still debated. No
   experimental study has yet evaluated the possible effects of heterostyly
   on pre-and postmating reproductive mechanisms. We quantify multiple
   reproductive barriers between the heterostylous Primula elatior (oxlip)
   and P. vulgaris (primrose), which readily hybridize when co-occurring,
   and test whether traits of heterostyly contribute to reproductive
   barriers in unique ways. We find that premating isolation is key for
   both species, while postmating isolation is considerable only for P.
   vulgaris; ecogeographic isolation is crucial for both species, while
   phenological, seed developmental, and hybrid sterility barriers are also
   important in P. vulgaris, implicating sympatrically higher gene flow
   into P. elatior. We document for the first time that, in addition to the
   aforementioned species-dependent asymmetries, morph-dependent
   asymmetries affect reproductive barriers between heterostylous species.
   Indeed, the interspecific decrease of reciprocity between high sexual
   organs of complementary floral morphs limits interspecific pollen
   transfer from anthers of short-styled flowers to stigmas of long-styled
   flowers, while higher reciprocity between low sexual organs favors
   introgression over isolation from anthers of long-styled flowers to
   stigmas of short-styled flowers. Finally, intramorph incompatibility
   persists across species boundaries, but is weakened in long-styled
   flowers of P. elatior, opening a possible backdoor to gene flow through
   intramorph pollen transfer between species. Therefore, patterns of gene
   flow across species boundaries are likely affected by floral morph
   composition of adjacent populations. To summarize, our study highlights
   the general importance of premating isolation and newly illustrates that
   both morph-and species-dependent asymmetries shape boundaries between
   heterostylous species.}},

Title = {{Postmeiotic development of pollen surface layers requires two
   Arabidopsis ABCG-type transporters}},
Journal = {{PLANT CELL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1863-1873}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Two Arabidopsis ABC transporters, ABCG1 and ABCG16, are expressed in the
   tapetal layer, specifically after postmeiotic microspore release, and
   play important roles in pollen surface development.
   The male gametophytic cells of terrestrial plants, the pollen grains,
   travel far before fertilization, and thus require strong protective
   layers, which take the form of a pollen coat and a pollen wall. The
   protective surface structures are generated by the tapetum, the tissue
   surrounding the developing gametophytes. Many ABC transporters,
   including Arabidopsis thaliana ABCG1 and ABCG16, have been shown to play
   essential roles in the development of such protective layers. However,
   the details of the mechanism of their function remain to be clarified.
   In this study, we show that ABCG1 and ABCG16 are localized at the plasma
   membrane of tapetal cells, specifically after postmeiotic microspore
   release, and play critical roles in the postmeiotic stages of male
   gametophyte development. Consistent with this stage-specific expression,
   the abcg1 abcg16 double knockout mutant exhibited defects in pollen
   development after postmeiotic microspore release; their microspores
   lacked intact nexine and intine layers, exhibited defects in pollen
   mitosis I, displayed ectopic deposits of arabinogalactan proteins,
   failed to complete cytokinesis, and lacked sperm cells. Interestingly,
   the double mutant exhibited abnormalities in the internal structures of
   tapetal cells, too; the storage organelles of tapetal cells, tapetosomes
   and elaioplasts, were morphologically altered. Thus, this work reveals
   that the lack of ABCG1 and ABCG16 at the tapetal cell membrane causes a
   broad range of defects in pollen, as well as in tapetal cells
   themselves. Furthermore, these results suggest that normal pollen
   surface development is necessary for normal development of the pollen
   cytoplasm.}},

Title = {{Sustainable Digital Environments: What Major Challenges Is Humankind
   Facing?}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper identifies and discusses the benefits, threats, and
   vulnerabilities related to the digital revolution. It aims to motivate
   research and its funding regarding digital threats and vulnerabilities
   related, in particular, to anticipating unintended, undesirable rebound
   effects, tipping points, critically fast evolutionary change rates,
   trade-offs, etc. A brief analysis of the history of the mind and
   technology reveals slow technological development over tens of thousands
   of years (including the invention of a place-value digital number
   system). Then, a small series of groundbreaking ideas (e.g., binary
   logic, Shannon's symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits,
   architectures of computing) enabled the industry-driven invention of
   programmable computing machines. Ultimately, the mastery of electron and
   semiconductor physics allowed for economical and seemingly unlimited
   storage capacity that made digital tools available to all domains of
   society. Based on the historical analysis, a coupled human-environment
   systems perspective (that includes a hierarchy assumption ranging from
   the human cell to the human species) enables the identification of
   several potential challenges to society and science. First, digital
   nano-engineering promotes genetic modifications (i.e., directed
   evolution), and synthetic biology enables a new level of the
   appropriation of nature. The understanding of cell-based biocomputers
   may call for new forms of logic. These and other challenges require
   thorough sustainability research in order to anticipate major changes on
   all levels of human systems. Second, the human individual is exposed to
   new forms of vulnerability. In particular, the potential epigenetic
   effects resulting from the excessive use of digital information of
   historically unknown speed, density, and contents and the loss of (the
   Western common-law right to) privacy resulting from big data (whose
   ownership is often unknown) should become subjects of research. Third,
   digital technologies are responsible for rapid changes in all social and
   economic structures. The paper suggests that thorough, discipline-based
   interdisciplinary research is needed in order to develop basic knowledge
   for creating and managing resilient relationships between human systems
   and their digital environments.}},

Abstract = {{Large male body size is typically favored by directional sexual
   selection through competition for mates. However, alternative male
   life-history phenotypes, such as ``sneakers,{''} should decrease the
   strength of sexual selection acting on body size of large ``fighter{''}
   males. We tested this prediction with salmon species; in southern
   populations, where sneakers are common, fighter males should be smaller
   than in northern populations, where sneakers are rare, leading to
   geographical clines in sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Consistent with our
   prediction, fighter male body size and SSD (fighter male: female size)
   increase with latitude in species with sneaker males (Atlantic salmon
   Salmo salar and masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou) but not in species
   without sneakers (chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta and pink salmon
   Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). This is the first evidence that sneaker males
   affect SSD across populations and species, and it suggests that
   alternative male mating strategies may shape the evolution of body size.}},

Abstract = {{Although virtually all experts agree that CO2 emissions are causing
   anthropogenic global warming, public discourse is replete with
   contrarian claims that either deny that global warming is happening or
   dispute a human influence. Although the rejection of climate science is
   known to be driven by ideological, psychological, and political factors
   rather than scientific disagreement, contrarian views have considerable
   prominence in the media. A better understanding of contrarian discourse
   is therefore called for. We report a blind expert test of contrarian
   claims about climatological variables. Expert economists and
   statisticians were presented with representative contrarian statements
   (e.g., ``Arctic ice is recovering{''}) translated into an economic or
   demographic context. In that blind test, contrarian claims were found to
   be misleading. By contrast, mainstream scientific interpretations of the
   data were judged to be accurate and policy relevant. The results imply
   that media inclusion of contrarian statements may increase bias rather
   than balance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) is a novel remote sensing
   parameter providing an estimate of actual photosynthetic rates. A
   combination of this new observable and Monteith's light use efficiency
   (LUE) concept was suggested for an advanced modeling of gross primary
   productivity (GPP). In this demonstration study, we evaluate the
   potential of both F and the more commonly used photochemical reflectance
   index (PRI) to approximate the LUE term in Monteith's equation and
   eventually improve the forward modeling of GPP diurnals. Both F and the
   PRI were derived from ground and airborne based spectrometer
   measurements over two different crops. We demonstrate that approximating
   dynamic changes of LUE using F and PRI significantly improves the
   forward modeling of GPP diurnals. Especially in sugar beet, a changing
   photosynthetic efficiency during the day was traceable with F and
   incorporating F in the forward modeling significantly improved the
   estimation of GPP. Airborne data were projected to produce F and PRI
   maps for winter wheat and sugar beet fields over the course of one day.
   We detected a significant variability of both, F and the PRI within one
   field and particularly between fields. The variability of F and PRI was
   higher in sugar beet, which also showed a physiological down-regulation
   of leaf photosynthesis. Our results underline the potential of F to
   serve as a superior indicator for the actual efficiency of the
   photosynthetic machinery, which is linked to physiological responses of
   vegetation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEODESY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{403-422}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Remote sensing radar satellites cover wide areas and provide spatially
   dense measurements, with millions of scatterers. Knowledge of the
   precise position of each radar scatterer is essential to identify the
   corresponding object and interpret the estimated deformation. The
   absolute position accuracy of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scatterers
   in a 2D radar coordinate system, after compensating for atmosphere and
   tidal effects, is in the order of centimeters for TerraSAR-X (TSX)
   spotlight images. However, the absolute positioning in 3D and its
   quality description are not well known. Here, we exploit time-series
   interferometric SAR to enhance the positioning capability in three
   dimensions. The 3D positioning precision is parameterized by a
   variance-covariance matrix and visualized as an error ellipsoid centered
   at the estimated position. The intersection of the error ellipsoid with
   objects in the field is exploited to link radar scatterers to real-world
   objects. We demonstrate the estimation of scatterer position and its
   quality using 20 months of TSX stripmap acquisitions over Delft, the
   Netherlands. Using trihedral corner reflectors (CR) for validation, the
   accuracy of absolute positioning in 2D is about 7 cm. In 3D, an absolute
   accuracy of up to 66 cm is realized, with a cigar-shaped error ellipsoid
   having centimeter precision in azimuth and range dimensions, and
   elongated in cross-range dimension with a precision in the order of
   meters (the ratio of the ellipsoid axis lengths is 1/3/213,
   respectively). The CR absolute 3D position, along with the associated
   error ellipsoid, is found to be accurate and agree with the ground truth
   position at a confidence level. For other non-CR coherent scatterers,
   the error ellipsoid concept is validated using 3D building models. In
   both cases, the error ellipsoid not only serves as a quality descriptor,
   but can also help to associate radar scatterers to real-world objects.}},

Abstract = {{Sacred natural sites (SNS) are instances of biocultural landscapes
   protected for spiritual motives. These sites frequently host important
   biological values in areas of Asia and Africa, where traditional
   resource management is still upheld by local communities. In contrast,
   the biodiversity value of SNS has hardly been quantitatively tested in
   Western contexts, where customs and traditions have relatively lost
   importance due to modernization and secularization. To assess whether
   SNS in Western contexts retain value for biodiversity, we studied plant
   species composition at 30 SNS in Central Italy and compared them with a
   paired set of similar but not sacred reference sites. We demonstrate
   that SNS are important for conserving stands of large trees and habitat
   heterogeneity across different land-cover types. Further, SNS harbor
   higher plant species richness and a more valuable plant species pool,
   and significantly contribute to diversity at the landscape scale. We
   suggest that these patterns are related not only to pre-existent
   features, but also to traditional management. Conservation of SNS should
   take into account these specificities, and their cultural as well as
   biological values, by supporting the continuation of traditional
   management practices.}},

Title = {{Spatial patterns of genetic diversity, community composition and
   occurrence of native and non-native amphipods in naturally replicated
   tributary streams}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Worldwide, natural communities are invaded by non-native
   species, with potentially devastating effects on the native communities.
   A large part of past research aimed at finding traits and
   characteristics of the invading species or the invaded community
   explaining observed invasions. Only recently, the focus shifted on the
   spatial patterns during invasions per se. Empirical data, however, are
   limited, as invasions are often unique incidences of a complex
   spatio-temporal process. In order to identify generalities of invasion
   patterns, we studied 13 naturally replicated tributary streams draining
   into Lake Constance, and studied the occurrence of native and non-native
   amphipods along linear transects from the stream outlets to the upstream
   headwater reaches.
   Results: We found repeated spatial patterns of community composition and
   the occurrence of native and non-native amphipod species across two
   different years. Specifically, occurrence as well as abundance of two
   non-native amphipod species decreased from the stream outlets at the
   lake site towards upstream headwater reaches. Populations of the most
   common native amphipod species were largest at the uppermost headwater
   reaches. All populations of this native species, however, showed
   significant signals of recent genetic bottlenecks, irrespective of the
   stream position and occurrence of non-native species. Contrary to our
   expectations, this native species also showed no longitudinal genetic
   differentiation within individual tributaries as postulated for
   headwater versus outlet populations.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that invasions of river-systems may
   overall follow predictable patterns on the level of spatial
   distributions and community composition. However, effects of invading
   organisms on the genetic diversity and genetic structure of native
   populations observed at larger scales may not necessarily be directly
   reflected at the scale of smaller tributaries.}},

Journal = {{PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{245}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Plant development and architecture are greatly influenced by the polar
   distribution of the essential hormone auxin. The directional influx and
   efflux of auxin from plant cells depends primarily on AUX1/LAX, PIN, and
   ABCB/PGP/MDR families of auxin transport proteins. The functional
   analysis of these proteins has progressed rapidly within the last decade
   thanks to the establishment of heterologous auxin transport systems.
   Heterologous co-expression allowed also for the testing of
   protein-protein interactions involved in the regulation of transporters
   and identified relationships with members of the FK506-Binding Protein
   (FKBP) and cyclophilin protein families, which are best known in
   non-plant systems as cellular receptors for the immunosuppressant drugs,
   FK506 and cyclosporin A, respectively. Current evidence that such
   interactions affect membrane trafficking, and potentially the activity
   of auxin transporters is reviewed. We also propose that FKBPs
   andcyclophilins might integrate the action of auxin transport
   inhibitors, such as NPA, on members of the ABCB and PIN family,
   respectively. Finally, we outline open questions that might be useful
   for further elucidation of the role of immunophilins as regulators
   (servants) of auxin transporters (masters). (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Female choice based on multiple male traits, rather than on any single
   one, has been reported in many species and may well be a rule rather
   than an exception. However, the implications this has for selection
   acting on choosiness itself remain underappreciated. We argue that this
   constitutes one of the important impediments to our understanding of the
   evolution of mate choice. We discuss this issue primarily in the context
   of the Fisherian model of sexual selection. We review theory and
   empirical data, showing how the crucial parameter of the modelgenetic
   variation in male attractivenesscan be estimated when attractiveness is
   a function of multiple traits. Based on the reviewed theory, we show how
   relying on individual male traits, instead of overall attractiveness,
   can produce biased estimates of Fisherian benefits of female choice.
   This bias can be substantial, especially when many traits contribute to
   male attractiveness. We discuss a number of methodological issues that,
   we hope, will stimulate future studies and help resolving the
   long-standing mystery of mate choice.}},

   effects and particularly the role of plant-soil interactions in this
   process. Soil-legacy effects may occur if co-evolved interactions with
   soil communities either positively or negatively modify plant
   biodiversity effects. We tested how plant selection and soil legacy
   influence biodiversity effects on productivity, and whether such effects
   increase the resistance of the communities to invasion by weeds. We used
   two plant selection treatments: parental plants growing in monoculture
   or in mixture over 8 yr in a grassland biodiversity experiment in the
   field, which we term monoculture types and mixture types. The two
   soil-legacy treatments used in this study were neutral soil inoculated
   with live or sterilized soil inocula collected from the same plots in
   the biodiversity experiment. For each of the four factorial
   combinations, seedlings of eight species were grown in monocultures or
   four-species mixtures in pots in an experimental garden over 15 weeks.
   Soil legacy (live inoculum) strongly increased biodiversity
   complementarity effects for communities of mixture types, and to a
   significantly weaker extent for communities of monoculture types. This
   may be attributed to negative plant-soil feedbacks suffered by mixture
   types in monocultures, whereas monoculture types had positive plant-soil
   feedbacks, in both monocultures and mixtures. Monocultures of mixture
   types were most strongly invaded by weeds, presumably due to increased
   pathogen susceptibility, reduced biomass, and altered plant-soil
   interactions of mixture types. These results show that biodiversity
   effects in experimental grassland communities can be modified by the
   evolution of positive vs. negative plant-soil feedbacks of plant
   monoculture vs. mixture types.}},

Abstract = {{Vinceae comprises 9 genera and about 153 species. The genera differ
   greatly in a number of morphological traits, especially those relating
   to fruit and seeds, which resulted in their placement in different
   tribes and/or subtribes by earlier taxonomists. Here, 378 new
   chloroplast DNA sequences from 98 species from 5 tribes of the
   rauvolfioid grade were analyzed phylogenetically to test the monophyly
   of Vinceae, its 6 subtribes, and constituent genera, as well as the
   sectional treatments of Rauvolfia, and to find morphological
   synapomorphies for major clades. Vinceae, as currently circumscribed,
   was found to be monophyletic as were four of the six subtribes. Kopsia
   and Ochrosia were confirmed as successive sister groups to the rest. All
   nine genera currently recognized in the tribe were resolved as
   monophyletic, Laxoplumeria and Tonduzia for the first time. The broad
   circumscription of Petchia and Ochrosia proposed by previous authors was
   supported. The pantropical genus Rauvolfia is divided into two major
   lineages: one comprised entirely of paleotropical species, and the other
   the neotropical species, a recurring geographic pattern in the family.
   Surprisingly, the Hawaiian species of Vinceae have probably arisen by
   two different trans-oceanic routes, either by long-distance dispersal
   from Australasian (Ochrosia spp.) or Caribbean (Rauvolfia sandwicensis)
   ancestors. Within Rauvolfia, most of the sections, series and subseries
   recognized in previous classifications are paraphyletic. Only 2 of the
   14 sections of Rauvolfia proposed by Pichon and 1 of the 11 sections
   proposed by Rao that are not monospecific were found to be monophyletic.
   Mapping of 30 morphological characters onto the molecular tree
   identified an unlobed upper wreath on the style head as an unambigous
   synapomorphy characterizing the tribe as well as synapomorphies for each
   of its genera. The two earliest-branching genera, Kopsia and Ochrosia,
   have dextrorse corolla lobe aestivation, in contrast to the sinistrorse
   corollas of the other Vinceae and the great majority of genera
   throughout the rauvolfioid grade. Drupes have arisen in parallel at
   least three times within Vinceae. The adaptations of the endocarp for
   water dispersal are possibly ancestral in the tribe, and the observed
   morphological differences between the drupaceous fruits of
   Kopsia/Ochrosia versus Petchia and Rauvolfia may be due to their abiotic
   versus biotic dispersal mode, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{C-4 photosynthesis represents an excellent example of convergent
   evolution that results in the optimization of both carbon and water
   usage by plants. In C-4 plants, a carbon-concentrating mechanism divided
   between bundle sheath and mesophyll cells increases photosynthetic
   efficiency. Compared with C-3 leaves, the carbon-concentrating mechanism
   of C-4 plants allows photosynthetic operation at lower stomatal
   conductance, and as a consequence, transpiration is reduced. Here, we
   characterize transcriptomes from guard cells in C-3 Tareneya hassleriana
   and C-4 Gynandropsis gynandra belonging to the Cleomaceae. While
   approximately 60\% of Gene Ontology terms previously associated with
   guard cells from the C-3 model Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) are
   conserved, there is much less overlap between patterns of individual
   gene expression. Most ion and CO2 signaling modules appear unchanged at
   the transcript level in guard cells from C-3 and C-4 species, but major
   variations in transcripts associated with carbon-related pathways known
   to influence stomatal behavior were detected. Genes associated with C-4
   photosynthesis were more highly expressed in guard cells of C-4 compared
   with C-3 leaves. Furthermore, we detected two major patterns of
   cell-specific C-4 gene expression within the C-4 leaf. In the first,
   genes previously associated with preferential expression in the bundle
   sheath showed continually decreasing expression from bundle sheath to
   mesophyll to guard cells. In the second, expression was maximal in the
   mesophyll compared with both guard cells and bundle sheath. These data
   imply that at least two gene regulatory networks act to coordinate gene
   expression across the bundle sheath, mesophyll, and guard cells in the
   C-4 leaf.}},

Abstract = {{Although chlorophyll (Chl) degradation is an essential biochemical
   pathway for plant physiology, our knowledge regarding this process still
   has unfilled gaps. Pheophytinase (PPH) was shown to be essential for Chl
   breakdown in dark-induced senescent leaves. However, the catalyzing
   enzymes involved in pigment turnover and fruit ripening-associated
   degreening are still controversial. Chl metabolism is closely linked to
   the biosynthesis of other isoprenoid-derived compounds, such as
   carotenoids and tocopherols, which are also components of the
   photosynthetic machinery. Chls, carotenoids and tocopherols share a
   common precursor, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, produced by the plastidial
   methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. Additionally, the Chl
   degradation-derived phytol can be incorporated into tocopherol
   biosynthesis. In this context, tomato turns out to be an interesting
   model to address isoprenoid-metabolic cross-talk since fruit ripening
   combines degreening and an intensely active MEP leading to carotenoid
   accumulation. Here, we investigate the impact of PPH deficiency beyond
   senescence by the comprehensive phenotyping of SlPPH-knockdown tomato
   plants. In leaves, photosynthetic parameters indicate altered energy
   usage of excited Chl. As a mitigatory effect, photosynthesis-associated
   carotenoids increased while tocopherol content remained constant.
   Additionally, starch and soluble sugar profiles revealed a distinct
   pattern of carbon allocation in leaves that suggests enhanced sucrose
   exportation. The higher levels of carbohydrates in sink organs
   down-regulated carotenoid biosynthesis. Additionally, the reduction in
   Chl-derived phytol recycling resulted in decreased tocopherol content in
   transgenic ripe fruits. Summing up, tocopherol and carotenoid
   metabolism, together with the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic
   and hydrophobic fractions, were differentially affected in leaves and
   fruits of the transgenic plants. Thus, in tomato, PPH plays a role
   beyond senescence-associated Chl degradation that, when compromised,
   affects isoprenoid and carbon metabolism which ultimately alters the
   fruit's nutraceutical content.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between top predators and mesopredators of the same guild
   often result in habitat segregation restricting interactions to shared
   habitat edges. Although negative edge effects are recognized as
   important spatial patterns in the ecology of fragmented landscapes, the
   underlying mechanisms of predator-prey interactions resulting in
   negative edge effects remain unknown. To disentangle top-down effects of
   intraguild predators and bottom-up effects of shared resources on
   mesopredator spatial distribution, we recorded the occurrence of tawny
   owls Strix aluco in forests and their prey, the little owl Athene noctua
   in adjacent open areas over 2 yr across 687 km(2) in Southern Germany.
   We developed a new, asymmetrical dynamic two-species occupancy model
   investigating spatial interactions while accounting for imperfect
   detection. Little owl occupancy was strongly reduced within 150 m of
   forests, but only in the presence of tawny owls. Analysis of over 30000
   telemetry locations of 275 little owls showed that little owls strongly
   avoided areas closer than 150 m from the forest during range use. These
   results suggest that the negative edge effect is due to forest edge
   avoidance rather than direct predation. Potential confounding mechanisms
   such as food depletion or habitat avoidance at forest edges can be ruled
   out. Thus, top-down effects caused by avoidance of intraguild top
   predators shape the spatial distribution of mesopredators such as the
   little owl. While habitat complexity mitigates multitrophic interactions
   within habitats, it is expected to reinforce multitrophic interactions
   between habitats, potentially leading to the suppression of
   mesopredators from suitable habitats.}},

Title = {{Scale and scope matter when explaining varying patterns of community

Abstract = {{Large-scale species and genetic metacommunity patterns are influenced by
   variation in environmental factors and distance between communities,
   according to previous studies. However, these studies often used
   different measures to assess patterns of metacommunity diversity,
   distances between communities and grain sizes at which environmental
   variables arc measured. This hinders interpretations and generalizations
   of the underlying process that drive metacommunity diversity. We applied
   a synthetic and multi -analytical approach to identify general factors
   structuring the diversity of a large riverine metacommunity. Using
   complementing approaches we analyzed how distance, measured as Euclidean
   or topological distance, and environmental factors, assessed at
   different grain sizes, influenced different measures of metacommunity
   diversity (species richness, functional richness and phylogenetic
   diversity) of mayfly, stonefly and caddisfly species in a large river
   network (river Rhine, Switzerland). We found the amount of explained
   variation in species diversity was generally unaffected by grain size,
   but improved with the use of topological distance, compared to Euclidean
   distance. Variation in functional diversity was best explained by
   environmental factors at small grain sizes and topological distance.
   Variation in phylogenetic diversity was best explained when
   environmental variables were assessed at larger grain sizes and
   Euclidean distance was used. Overall, our results indicate that
   processes structuring metacommunity diversity may differ at the species,
   functional or phylogenetic level of the community, as recently
   postulated in the metacommunity phylogenetics approach. While such
   differences may hinder comparisons across studies using different
   methodologies, it offers opportunities to disentangle the structuring
   factors within metacommunities by applying multiple analytical
   approaches to the same dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing past impacts of observed climate change on natural, human and

   climatic and other drivers of change, and their respective interaction.
   Resulting requirements with regard to system understanding and long-term
   observational data can be prohibitive for quantitative detection and
   attribution methods, especially in the case of human systems and in
   regions with poor monitoring records. To enable a structured examination
   of past impacts in such cases, we follow the logic of quantitative
   attribution assessments, however, allowing for qualitative methods and
   different types of evidence. We demonstrate how multiple lines of
   evidence can be integrated in support of attribution exercises for human
   and managed systems. Results show that careful analysis can allow for
   attribution statements without explicit end-to-end modeling of the whole
   climate-impact system. However, care must be taken not to overstate or
   generalize the results and to avoid bias when the analysis is motivated
   by and limited to observations considered consistent with climate change
   impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Fitness can be profoundly influenced by the age at first reproduction
   (AFR), but to date the AFR-fitness relationship only has been
   investigated intraspecifically. Here, we investigated the relationship
   between AFR and average lifetime reproductive success (LRS) across 34
   bird species. We assessed differences in the deviation of the Optimal
   AFR (i.e., the species-specific AFR associated with the highest LRS)
   from the age at sexual maturity, considering potential effects of life
   history as well as social and ecological factors. Most individuals
   adopted the species-specific Optimal AFR and both the mean and Optimal
   AFR of species correlated positively with life span. Interspecific
   deviations of the Optimal AFR were associated with indices reflecting a
   change in LRS or survival as a function of AFR: a delayed AFR was
   beneficial in species where early AFR was associated with a decrease in
   subsequent survival or reproductive output. Overall, our results suggest
   that a delayed onset of reproduction beyond maturity is an optimal
   strategy explained by a long life span and costs of early reproduction.
   By providing the first empirical confirmations of key predictions of
   life-history theory across species, this study contributes to a better
   understanding of life-history evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic resistance carries a fitness cost that must be overcome in
   order for resistance to persist over the long term. Compensatory
   mutations that recover the functional defects associated with resistance
   mutations have been argued to play a key role in overcoming the cost of
   resistance, but compensatory mutations are expected to be rare relative
   to generally beneficial mutations that increase fitness, irrespective of
   antibiotic resistance. Given this asymmetry, population genetics theory
   predicts that populations should adapt by compensatory mutations when
   the cost of resistance is large, whereas generally beneficial mutations
   should drive adaptation when the cost of resistance is small. We tested
   this prediction by determining the genomic mechanisms underpinning
   adaptation to antibiotic-free conditions in populations of the
   pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa that carry costly antibiotic
   resistance mutations. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that populations
   founded by high-cost rifampicin-resistant mutants adapted via
   compensatory mutations in three genes of the RNA polymerase core enzyme,
   whereas populations founded by low-cost mutants adapted by generally
   beneficial mutations, predominantly in the quorum-sensing
   transcriptional regulator gene lasR. Even though the importance of
   compensatory evolution in maintaining resistance has been widely
   recognized, our study shows that the roles of general adaptation in
   maintaining resistance should not be underestimated and highlights the
   need to understand how selection at other sites in the genome influences
   the dynamics of resistance alleles in clinical settings.}},

Pages = {{4049-4064}},
Abstract = {{Vegetation changes, such as shrub encroachment and wetland expansion,
   have been observed in many Arctic tundra regions. These changes feed
   back to permafrost and climate. Permafrost can be protected by soil
   shading through vegetation as it reduces the amount of solar energy
   available for thawing. Regional climate can be affected by a reduction
   in surface albedo as more energy is available for atmospheric and soil
   heating. Here, we compared the shortwave radiation budget of two common
   Arctic tundra vegetation types dominated by dwarf shrubs (Betula nana)
   and wet sedges (Eriophorum angustifolium) in North-East Siberia. We
   measured time series of the shortwave and longwave radiation budget
   above the canopy and transmitted radiation below the canopy.
   Additionally, we quantified soil temperature and heat flux as well as
   active layer thickness. The mean growing season albedo of dwarf shrubs
   was 0.15 +/- 0.01, for sedges it was higher (0.17 +/- 0.02). Dwarf shrub
   transmittance was 0.36 +/- 0.07 on average, and sedge transmittance was
   0.28 +/- 0.08. The standing dead leaves contributed strongly to the soil
   shading of wet sedges. Despite a lower albedo and less soil shading, the
   soil below dwarf shrubs conducted less heat resulting in a 17cm
   shallower active layer as compared to sedges. This result was supported
   by additional, spatially distributed measurements of both vegetation
   types. Clouds were a major influencing factor for albedo and
   transmittance, particularly in sedge vegetation. Cloud cover reduced the
   albedo by 0.01 in dwarf shrubs and by 0.03 in sedges, while
   transmittance was increased by 0.08 and 0.10 in dwarf shrubs and sedges,
   respectively. Our results suggest that the observed deeper active layer
   below wet sedges is not primarily a result of the summer canopy
   radiation budget. Soil properties, such as soil albedo, moisture, and
   thermal conductivity, may be more influential, at least in our
   comparison between dwarf shrub vegetation on relatively dry patches and
   sedge vegetation with higher soil moisture.}},

Abstract = {{Polyandry is widespread across animal taxa and subjects males to intense
   postcopulatory sexual selection which favors adaptations that enhance a
   male's paternity success, either by decreasing the risk of sperm
   competition and/or by increasing the competitiveness of the ejaculate.
   Copulatory plugs deposited by males are thought to have evolved in the
   context of sperm competition. However, experimental studies that assess
   the function of copulatory plugs remain scarce. Moreover, most studies
   have used unnatural manipulations, such as ablating plug-producing male
   glands or interrupting copulations. Here, we investigated whether
   repeated ejaculation affects plug size in a mammalian model species, the
   house mouse. When males experience short periods of sexual rest we found
   that plug size decreased over repeated ejaculations so that time since
   last ejaculation can be applied as an approximation for plug size. We
   induced natural variation in plug size arising from variation in male
   sexual restedness and investigated the behavior and paternity success of
   rival males. Male behavior in the offensive mating role (second) was
   influenced, albeit not significantly, by the sexual restedness of the
   first male to mate, and therefore the size of his plug. However, second
   males sired a significantly greater proportion of embryos when competing
   against a male that had recently mated compared with a male that had
   not. This supports a potential role of the plug in promoting a male's
   competitive fertilization success when remating occurs, which could be
   mediated both by delaying female remating and by ensuring efficient
   sperm transport through the female reproductive tract.}},

Abstract = {{The monophyletic group of hornworts is believed to represent the
   immediate sister group of all vascular land plants. However, this
   traditional view is still debated and cannot be satisfactorily resolved
   owing to the lack of detailed knowledge on the general biology and
   genomic features of hornworts. Until now, advancement in this field was
   primarily hindered by the lack of genomic resources for a hornwort model
   species. Here we provide the first insight into the major features of
   the draft genome sequence of the model hornwort, Anthoceros agrestis. We
   show that A. agrestis has a remarkably small genome, with few recent
   paralogues, which makes it appropriate for genetic analysis. Finally, we
   also report on the genomic features of the chloroplast, mitochondrion
   and nuclear genomes and compare those with algal and vascular land plant
   genomes. At the very end of the chapter we summarize our achievements
   and provide a list of issues that need to be resolved in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The issue of climate related loss and damage (L\&D) has re-emerged and
   gained significant traction in international climate policy in recent
   years. However, many aspects remain unclear, including how aspects of
   liability and compensation in relation with L\&D will be treated under
   the UNFCCC, human rights and environmental law. Furthermore, the type of
   scientific evidence required to link climate change impacts for each of
   these L\&D mechanisms needs to be clarified. Here we analyze to which
   degree different types of scientific evidence can inform L\&D
   discussions and policies. We distinguish between (i) L\&D observation,
   (ii) understanding causation, and (iii) linking L\&D to anthropogenic
   emissions through attribution studies. We draw on three case studies
   from Australia, Colombia and Alaska to demonstrate the relevance of the
   different types of evidence. We then discuss the potential and
   limitations of these types of scientific evidence, in particular
   attribution, for informing current L\&D discussions and policies.
   Attribution (iii) sets the highest bar, but also provides the most
   complete set of information to support adaptation, risk reduction and
   L\&D policies. However, rather than suggesting that attribution is a
   necessary requirement for L\&D policies we want to highlight its
   potential for facilitating a more thematically structured, and thus
   hopefully a more constructive, policy and justice discussion.}},

Abstract = {{The biogeography of speciation and what can be learned about the past
   mode of speciation from current biogeography of sister species are
   recurrent problems in evolution. We used a trait- and individual-based,
   eco-evolutionary model to simulate adaptive radiations and recorded the
   geographical overlap of species during and after evolutionary branching
   (speciation). We compared the spatial overlap among sister species in
   the fully saturated community with the overlap at the speciation event.
   The mean geographic overlap at speciation varied continuously from
   complete (sympatry) to none (allopatry), depending on local and regional
   environmental heterogeneity and the rate of dispersal. The distribution
   of overlap was, however, in some cases considerably bimodal. This
   tendency was most expressed at large values of regional heterogeneity,
   corresponding to sharp environmental contrasts. The mean geographic
   overlap also varied during the course of a radiation, sometimes with a
   consistent negative trend over time. The speciations that resulted in
   currently observable end community sister species were therefore not an
   unbiased sample of all speciations throughout the radiation.
   Post-speciation range shifts (causing increased overlap) occurred most
   frequently when dispersal was high or when local habitat heterogeneity
   was low. Our results help us understand how the patterns of geographic
   mode of speciation emerge. We also show the difficulty in inferring the
   geographical speciation mode from phylogenies and the biogeography of
   extant species.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on the determinants of plant-herbivore and herbivore-parasitoid
   associations provide important insights into the origin and maintenance
   of global and local species richness. If parasitoids are specialists on
   herbivore niches rather than on herbivore taxa, then alternating escape
   of herbivores into novel niches and delayed resource tracking by
   parasitoids could fuel diversification at both trophic levels. We used
   DNA barcoding to identify parasitoids that attack larvae of seven
   Pontania sawfly species that induce leaf galls on eight willow species
   growing in subarctic and arctic-alpine habitats in three geographic
   locations in northern Fennoscandia, and then applied distance- and
   model-based multivariate analyses and phylogenetic regression methods to
   evaluate the hierarchical importance of location, phylogeny and
   different galler niche dimensions on parasitoid host use. We found
   statistically significant variation in parasitoid communities across
   geographic locations and willow host species, but the differences were
   mainly quantitative due to extensive sharing of enemies among gallers
   within habitat types. By contrast, the divide between habitats defined
   two qualitatively different network compartments, because many common
   parasitoids exhibited strong habitat preference. Galler and parasitoid
   phylogenies did not explain associations, because distantly related
   arctic-alpine gallers were attacked by a species-poor enemy community
   dominated by two parasitoid species that most likely have independently
   tracked the gallers' evolutionary shifts into the novel habitat. Our
   results indicate that barcode- and phylogeny-based analyses of food webs
   that span forested vs. tundra or grassland environments could improve
   our understanding of vertical diversification effects in complex
   plant-herbivore-parasitoid networks.}},

Abstract = {{Local adaptation is a key process for the maintenance of genetic
   diversity and population diversification. A better understanding of the
   mechanisms that allow (or prevent) local adaptation constitutes a key in
   apprehending how and at what spatial scale it occurs. The production of
   resting stages is found in many taxa and reflects an adaptation to
   outlast adverse environmental conditions. Daphnia magna (Crustacea) can
   alternate between asexual and sexual reproduction, the latter being
   linked to dormancy, as resting stages can only be produced sexually. In
   this species, on a continental scale, resting-stage production is
   locally adaptedthat is, it is induced when the photoperiod indicates the
   imminence of habitat deterioration. Here, we aimed to explore whether
   selection is strong enough to maintain local adaptation at a scale of a
   few kilometers. We assessed life-history traits of 64 D. magna clones
   originating from 11 populations of a metapopulation with permanent and
   intermittent pool habitats. We found large within- and
   between-population variation for all dormancy-related traits, but no
   evidence for the hypothesized higher resting-stage production in animals
   from intermittent habitats. We discuss how gene flow, founder events, or
   other forms of selection might interfere with the process of local
   adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{The ultimate cause of genome size (GS) evolution in eukaryotes remains a
   major and unresolved puzzle in evolutionary biology. Large-scale
   comparative studies have failed to find consistent correlations between
   GS and organismal properties, resulting in the `C-value paradox'.
   Current hypotheses for the evolution of GS are based either on the
   balance between mutational events and drift or on natural selection
   acting upon standing genetic variation in GS. It is, however, currently
   very difficult to evaluate the role of selection because within-species
   studies that relate variation in life-history traits to variation in GS
   are very rare. Here, we report phylogenetic comparative analyses of GS
   evolution in seed beetles at two distinct taxonomic scales, which
   combines replicated estimation of GS with experimental assays of
   life-history traits and reproductive fitness. GS showed rapid and
   bidirectional evolution across species, but did not show correlated
   evolution with any of several indices of the relative importance of
   genetic drift. Within a single species, GS varied by 4-5\% across
   populations and showed positive correlated evolution with independent
   estimates of male and female reproductive fitness. Collectively, the
   phylogenetic pattern of GS diversification across and within species in
   conjunction with the pattern of correlated evolution between GS and
   fitness provide novel support for the tenet that natural selection plays
   a key role in shaping GS evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The development and persistence of personality in nature are
   counterintuitive because, in heterogeneous environments, personality is
   expected to limit the degree of behavioural flexibility. Recent work has
   shown that personality and behavioural flexibility might be linked, but
   their interaction is not well understood and could be elucidated by
   studying a socially flexible species. Using well-established tests, we
   measured the personality traits of activity, boldness, exploration and
   aggressiveness in free-living striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) in South
   Africa. Specifically, we tested whether personality changes when
   individuals change their reproductive tactic, either from group-living
   philopatrics to solitary-living females and roaming males or from
   non-breeding philopatrics to breeders. Our results showed that striped
   mice have personalities: Individuals behaved consistently for all the
   behavioural traits measured both over time and contexts (breeding to
   non-breeding season). While most of the personality traits measured
   remained consistent among tactics, they did not predict which tactic an
   individual would adopt next, suggesting that environmental conditions
   rather than personality influence tactic switching. Additionally, we
   found important differences in the consistency of the behaviours
   measured between males and females, indicating that sexual selection
   might play a prominent role in the maintenance of personality in this
   species. Our study demonstrates that some personality traits can be
   stable over an entire lifetime even in socially flexible species and
   that personality does not constrain social flexibility.}},

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{178}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{549-556}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The strength of interspecific interactions is often proposed to affect
   food web stability, with weaker interactions increasing the persistence
   of species, and food webs as a whole. However, the mechanisms that
   modify interaction strengths, and their effects on food web persistence
   are not fully understood. Using food webs containing different
   combinations of predator, prey, and nonprey species, we investigated how
   predation risk of susceptible prey is affected by the presence of
   species not directly trophically linked to either predators or prey. We
   predicted that indirect alterations to the strength of trophic
   interactions translate to changes in persistence time of
   extinction-prone species. We assembled interaction webs of protist
   consumers and turbellarian predators with eight different combinations
   of prey, predators and nonprey species, and recorded abundances for over
   130 prey generations. Persistence of predation-susceptible species was
   increased by the presence of nonprey. Furthermore, multiple nonprey
   species acted synergistically to increase prey persistence, such that
   persistence was greater than would be predicted from the dynamics of
   simpler food webs. We also found evidence suggesting increased food web
   complexity may weaken interspecific competition, increasing persistence
   of poorer competitors. Our results demonstrate that persistence times in
   complex food webs cannot be predicted from the dynamics of simplified
   systems, and that species not directly involved in consumptive
   interactions likely play key roles in maintaining persistence. Global
   species diversity is currently declining at an unprecedented rate and
   our findings reveal that concurrent loss of species that modify trophic
   interactions may have unpredictable consequences for food web stability.}},

Abstract = {{The `breaker' element ( GcB ) of the gametocidal locus derived from
   Aegilops sharonensis has been mapped to a region proximal to a block of
   sub-telomeric heterochromatin on chromosome 4S (sh) L.
   The production of alien chromosome addition lines allows the transfer of
   useful genetic variation into elite wheat varieties from related wild
   species. However, some wild relatives of wheat, particularly those
   within the Sitopsis section of the genus Aegilops, possess chromosomes
   that are transmitted preferentially to the offspring when addition lines
   are generated. Species within the Sitopsis group possess the S genome,
   and among these species, Aegilops sharonensis (2n = 14, (SSsh)-S-sh)
   carries the S-sh genome which is closely related to the D genome of
   hexaploid wheat. Some S genome chromosomes carry gametocidal loci, which
   induce severe chromosome breakage in gametes lacking the gametocidal
   chromosome, and hence, result in gamete abortion. The preferential
   transmission of gametocidal loci could be exploited in wheat breeding,
   because linking gametocidal loci with important agronomic traits in
   elite wheat varieties would ensure retention of these traits through
   successive generations. In this study, we have mapped the breaker
   element of the gametocidal locus derived from Ae. sharonensis to the
   region immediately proximal to a block of sub-telomeric heterochromatin
   on the long arm of chromosome 4S(sh).}},

Abstract = {{The plant and insect communities of many summer pastures in the Swiss
   Alps are changing as they become encroached by woody plants. To
   understand the implications for overall biodiversity, we need to
   determine how different taxonomic groups respond to shrub encroachment.
   We investigated effects of encroachment upon species diversity of
   vascular plants, butterflies, and grasshoppers on two subalpine pastures
   (Mesocco and Guarda). On each site, we recognized a sequence of
   vegetation types representing a gradient of increasing shrub cover. The
   number of rare plant species was strongly affected by the degree of
   encroachment, with areas dominated by either dwarf shrubs or Alnus
   viridis having fewer species than areas of open grassland. In the
   Mesocco site, we also found differences in other measures of plant
   species richness (total species richness, number of herbaceous species)
   and in the number of grasshopper species. While plant richness was
   highest in grassland-dominated vegetation types, the species richness of
   grasshoppers was highest in types with a low to intermediate cover of
   dwarf shrubs. We found no effect of shrub cover upon butterfly species
   richness at either site. Biotic factors (shrub cover, grazing intensity,
   and also vegetation-related variables for the insect groups) explained a
   larger proportion of the variance in species composition of both plants
   and insects than did large-scale abiotic factors (altitude, aspect, and
   slope). Our results demonstrate that shrub encroachment is a threat to
   the biodiversity of subalpine grassland ecosystems. We recommend
   conservation actions that prevent extensive shrub encroachment but
   promote a mosaic of small areas at different successional stages.}},

Title = {{A new positive relationship between pCO(2) and stomatal frequency in
   Quercus guyavifolia (Fagaceae): a potential proxy for palaeo-CO2 levels}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims The inverse relationship between atmospheric CO2
   partial pressure (pCO(2)) and stomatal frequency in many species of
   plants has been widely used to estimate palaeoatmospheric CO2
   (palaeo-CO2) levels; however, the results obtained have been quite
   variable. This study attempts to find a potential new proxy for
   palaeo-CO2 levels by analysing stomatal frequency in Quercus guyavifolia
   (Q. guajavifolia, Fagaceae), an extant dominant species of
   sclerophyllous forests in the Himalayas with abundant fossil relatives.
   Methods Stomatal frequency was analysed for extant samples of Q.
   guyavifolia collected from17 field sites at altitudes ranging between
   2493 and 4497 m. Herbarium specimens collected between 1926 and 2011
   were also examined. Correlations of pCO(2)-stomatal frequency were
   determined using samples from both sources, and these were then applied
   to Q. preguyavaefolia fossils in order to estimate palaeo-CO2
   concentrations for two late-Pliocene floras in south-western China.
   Key Results In contrast to the negative correlations detected for most
   other species that have been studied, a positive correlation between
   pCO(2) and stomatal frequency was determined in Q. guyavifolia sampled
   from both extant field collections and historical herbarium specimens.
   Palaeo-CO2 concentrations were estimated to be approx. 180-240 ppm in
   the late Pliocene, which is consistent with most other previous
   estimates.
   Conclusions A new positive relationship between pCO(2) and stomatal
   frequency in Q. guyavifolia is presented, which can be applied to the

Abstract = {{Oxygen (O-2) supply and the related redox potential (E-H) are important
   parameters for interactions between roots and microorganisms in the
   rhizosphere. Rhizosphere extension in terms of the spatial distribution
   of O-2 concentration and E-H is poorly documented under aerobic soil
   conditions. We investigated how far O-2 consumption of roots and
   microorganisms in the rhizosphere is replenished by O-2 diffusion as a
   function of water/air-filled porosity. Oxygen concentration and E-H in
   the rhizosphere were monitored at a mm-scale by means of
   electroreductive Clark-type sensors and miniaturized E-H electrodes
   under various matric potential ranges. Respiratory activity of roots and
   microorganisms was calculated from O-2 profiles and diffusion
   coefficients. pH profiles were determined in thin soil layers sliced
   near the root surface. Gradients of O-2 concentration and the extent of
   anoxic zones depended on the respiratory activity near the root surface.
   Matric potential, reflecting air-filled porosity, was found to be the
   most important factor affecting O-2 transport in the rhizosphere. Under
   water-saturated conditions and near field capacity up to -200 hPa, O-2
   transport was limited, causing a decline in oxygen partial pressures
   (pO(2)) to values between 0 and 3 kPa at the root surface. Aerobic
   respiration increased by a factor of 100 when comparing the saturated
   with the driest status. At an air-filled porosity of 9\% to 12\%,
   diffusion of O-2 increased considerably. This was confirmed by E-H
   around 300 mV under aerated conditions, while E-H decreased to 100 mV on
   the root surface under near water-saturated conditions. Gradients of
   pO(2) and pH from the root surface indicated an extent of the
   rhizosphere effect of 10-20 mm. In contrast, E-H gradients were observed
   from 0 to 2 mm from the root surface. We conclude that the rhizosphere
   extent differs for various parameters (pH, Eh, pO(2)) and is strongly
   dependent on soil moisture.}},

Abstract = {{Ecologists increasingly consider phylogenetic relatedness in both
   community composition and spatial arrangements in communities. Here we
   considered both the phylogenetic correlation between multiple species
   and the spatial correlation induced by unobserved spatial heterogeneity
   on multiple plots. For this analysis, we introduced phylogenetic spatial
   generalised linear mixed models (PSGLMMs), which are an extension of
   phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models (PGLMMs). We used the
   framework of generalised linear array models to simultaneously model
   species and plot dimension. Such models have the potential to explain
   the correlation of the phylogenetic relationship of the observed species
   and of the spatial proximity of the plots, or both. We proposed model
   selection strategies based on proper scores and empirically evaluated
   them in a case study using bird count data. In our analysis, we focused
   on two special cases: the community composition model and the
   environmental sensitivity model. Our simulation study indicated that it
   might be difficult to correctly identify phylogenetic signals when the
   phylogenetic correlation is rather low and when studying
   presence-absence or count data of rare or pervasive species.}},

Abstract = {{Costly female mating preferences for purely Fisherian male traits (i.e.
   sexual ornaments that are genetically uncorrelated with inherent
   viability) are not expected to persist at equilibrium. The indirect
   benefit of producing sexy sons' (Fisher process) disappears: in some
   models, the male trait becomes fixed; in others, a range of male trait
   values persist, but a larger trait confers no net fitness advantage
   because it lowers survival. Insufficient indirect selection to counter
   the direct cost of producing fewer offspring means that preferences are
   lost. The only well-cited exception assumes biased mutation on male
   traits. The above findings generally assume constant direct selection
   against female preferences (i.e. fixed costs). We show that if
   mate-sampling costs are instead derived based on an explicit account of
   how females acquire mates, an initially costly mating preference can
   coevolve with a male trait so that both persist in the presence or
   absence of biased mutation. Our models predict that empirically
   detecting selection at equilibrium will be difficult, even if selection
   was responsible for the location of the current equilibrium. In general,
   it appears useful to integrate mate sampling theory with models of
   genetic consequences of mating preferences: being explicit about the
   process by which individuals select mates can alter equilibria.}},

Abstract = {{Plastid casein kinase II is an important regulator of transcription,
   posttranscriptional processes, and, most likely, different metabolic
   functions in dicotyledonous species. Here we report the identification
   and characterization of pCKII from the monocotyledonous species Oryza
   sativa. OspCKII activity was enriched from isolated rice chloroplasts
   using heparin-Sepharose chromatography, in which it co-elutes with the
   transcriptionally active chromosome (TAC) and several ribosomal
   proteins. Inclusion mass scanning of the kinase-active fraction
   identified the gene model for OspCKII. Transient expression of GFP fused
   to the 184 N-terminal amino acids of the OspCKII sequence in rice
   confirmed the chloroplastic localization of the kinase. OspCKII activity
   shows the characteristic features of casein kinase II, such as the
   utilization of GTP as phosphate donor, inhibition by low concentrations
   of heparin and poly-lysine, and utilization of the canonical pCKII motif
   E-S-E-G-E in the model substrate RNP29. Phosphoproteome analysis of a
   protein extract from rice leaves combined with a meta-analysis with
   published phosphoproteomics data revealed differences in the target
   protein spectrum between rice and Arabidopsis. Consistently, several
   pCKII phosphorylation sites in dicotyledonous plants are not conserved
   in monocots and algae, suggesting that details of pCKII regulation in
   plastids have changed during evolution.}},

   Sr levels had no effect on the accumulation of shoot biomass at
   tillering or at maturity. Mean shoot Sr concentration of naked oat and
   barley at tillering was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of
   wheat; Neimengkeyimai-1, a naked oat cultivar, had the highest Sr
   concentrations. At maturity, of four naked oat cultivars,
   Neimengkeyimai-1 had the highest Sr content at all measured Sr levels.
   Leaves had the highest Sr concentrations, followed by roots and straw,
   and then grain with the lowest. Mean enrichment coefficients from soil
   to shoots ranged from 0.521 to 1.343; the percentage of stable Sr
   removed from the soil to the shoots at harvest time was more than 1.4\%

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic signal quantifies the degree to which resemblance in
   continuously valued traits reflects phylogenetic relatedness. Measures
   of phylogenetic signal are widely used in ecological and evolutionary
   research and are recently gaining traction in viral evolutionary
   studies. Standard estimators of phylogenetic signal frequently condition
   on data summary statistics of the repeated trait observations and fixed
   phylogenetics trees, resulting in information loss and potential bias.
   To incorporate the observation process and phylogenetic uncertainty in a
   model-based approach, we develop a novel Bayesian inference method to
   simultaneously estimate the evolutionary history and phylogenetic signal
   from molecular sequence data and repeated multivariate traits. Our
   approach builds upon a phylogenetic diffusion framework that models
   continuous trait evolution as a Brownian motion process and incorporates
   Pagel's transformation parameter to estimate dependence among traits. We
   provide a computationally efficient inference implementation in the
   BEAST software package. We evaluate the synthetic performance of the
   Bayesian estimator of phylogenetic signal against standard estimators
   and demonstrate the use of our coherent framework to address several

Abstract = {{Snakes possess a derived anatomy, characterized by limb reduction and
   reorganization of the skull and internal organs. To understand the
   origin of snakes from an ontogenetic point of view, we conducted
   comprehensive investigations on the timing of skeletal elements, based
   on published and new data, and reconstructed the evolution of the
   ossification sequence among squamates. We included for the first time
   Varanus, a critical taxon in phylogenetic context. There is
   comprehensive delay in the onset of ossification of most skeletal
   elements in snakes when compared to reference developmental events
   through evolution. We hypothesize that progressing deceleration
   accompanied limb reduction and reorganization of the snake skull.
   Molecular and morphological studies have suggested close relationship of
   snakes to either amphisbaenians, scincids, geckos, iguanids, or
   varanids. Likewise, alternative hypotheses on habitat for stem snakes
   have been postulated. Our comprehensive heterochrony analyses detected
   developmental shifts in ossification for each hypothesis of snake
   origin. Moreover, we show that reconstruction of ancestral developmental
   sequences is a valuable tool to understand ontogenetic mechanisms
   associated with major evolutionary changes and test homology hypotheses.
   The supratemporal of snakes could be homolog to squamosal of other
   squamates, which starts ossification early to become relatively large in
   snakes.}},

Abstract = {{In natural populations, mating between relatives can have important
   fitness consequences due to the negative effects of reduced
   heterozygosity. Parental level of inbreeding or heterozygosity has been
   also found to influence the performance of offspring, via direct and
   indirect parental effects that are independent of the progeny own level
   of genetic diversity. In this study, we first analysed the effects of
   parental heterozygosity and relatedness (i.e. an estimate of offspring
   genetic diversity) on four traits related to offspring viability in
   great tits (Parus major) using 15 microsatellite markers. Second, we
   tested whether significant heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs)
   were due to local' (i.e. linkage to genes influencing fitness) and/or
   general' (genome-wide heterozygosity) effects. We found a significant
   negative relationship between parental genetic relatedness and hatching
   success, and maternal heterozygosity was positively associated with
   offspring body size. The characteristics of the studied populations
   (recent admixture, polygynous matings) together with the fact that we
   found evidence for identity disequilibrium across our set of neutral
   markers suggest that HFCs may have resulted from genome-wide inbreeding
   depression. However, one locus (Ase18) had disproportionately large
   effects on the observed HFCs: heterozygosity at this locus had
   significant positive effects on hatching success and offspring size. It
   suggests that this marker may lie near to a functional locus under
   selection (i.e. a local effect) or, alternatively, heterozygosity at
   this locus might be correlated to heterozygosity across the genome due
   to the extensive ID found in our populations (i.e. a general effect).
   Collectively, our results lend support to both the general and local
   effect hypotheses and reinforce the view that HFCs lie on a continuum
   from inbreeding depression to those strictly due to linkage between
   marker loci and genes under selection.}},

Abstract = {{Despite their apparent interest, private investors are surprisingly
   disengaged from sustainable investing, an observation that has received
   limited scholarly attention. This theory building study draws on the
   theory of planned behaviour to conceptualize the decision-making process
   of private investors towards sustainable investing. Findings from
   literature provide some insights but do not yield a comprehensive answer
   as to why private investors refrain from sustainable investing.
   Interviews with wealthy private investors led us to identify a generally
   high interest in sustainable investing and dominant barriers that
   prevent actual engagement. Barriers are the perception of high
   volatility within sustainable investments in combination with, first, a
   short investment time horizon and, second, recent financial losses.
   Third, we find that investment advisors withhold required information
   from their clients. We suggest a decision-making framework that
   facilitates a better understanding of the engagement of private
   investors in sustainable investing and outline avenues for future
   research and implications for practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the function of variation in sleep requires studies in the
   natural ecological conditions in which sleep evolved. Sleep has an
   impact on individual performance and hence may integrate the costs and
   benefits of investing in processes that are sensitive to sleep, such as
   immunity or coping with stress. Because dark and pale melanic animals
   differentially regulate energy homeostasis, immunity and stress hormone
   levels, the amount and/or organization of sleep may covary with
   melanin-based colour. We show here that wild, cross-fostered nestling
   barn owls (Tyto alba) born from mothers displaying more black spots had
   shorter non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep bouts, a shorter latency
   until the occurrence of REM sleep after a bout of wakefulness and more
   wakefulness bouts. In male nestlings, the same sleep traits also
   correlated with their own level of spotting. Because heavily spotted
   male nestlings and the offspring of heavily spotted biological mothers
   switched sleep-wakefulness states more frequently, we propose the
   hypothesis that they could be also behaviourally more vigilant.
   Accordingly, nestlings from mothers displaying many black spots looked
   more often towards the nest entrance where their parents bring food and
   towards their sibling against whom they compete. Owlets from heavily
   spotted mothers might invest more in vigilance, thereby possibly
   increasing associated costs due to sleep fragmentation. We conclude that
   different strategies of the regulation of brain activity have evolved
   and are correlated with melanin-based coloration.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how biodiversity and ecosystem functioning respond to
   changes in the environment is fundamental to the maintenance of
   ecosystem function. In realistic scenarios, the biodiversity-ecosystem
   functioning path may account for only a small share of all factors
   determining ecosystem function. Here, we investigated the strength to
   which variations in environmental characteristics in a Neotropical
   savanna affected functional diversity and decomposition. We sought an
   integrative approach, testing a number of pairwise hypotheses about how
   the environment, biodiversity, and functioning were linked. We used
   structural equation modelling to connect fire frequency, soil fertility,
   exchangeable Al, water availability, functional diversity of woody
   plants, tree density, tree height, and litter decomposition rates in a
   causal chain. We found significant effects of soil nutrients, water
   availability, and Al on functional diversity and litter decomposition.
   Fire did not have a significant direct effect on functional diversity or
   litter decomposition. However, fire was connected to both variables
   through soil fertility. Functional diversity did not influence rates of
   litter decomposition. The mediated effects that emerged from pairwise
   interactions are encouraging not only for predicting the functional
   consequences of changes in environmental variables and biodiversity, but
   also to caution against predictions based on only environmental or only
   biodiversity change.}},

Title = {{A humped latitudinal phylogenetic diversity pattern of orchid bees (
   Hymenoptera: Apidae: Euglossini) in western Amazonia: assessing the
   influence of climate and geologic history}},

Abstract = {{Amazonian rainforests are among the most species-rich terrestrial
   habitats on Earth. The aim of this study was to analyze phylogenetic
   diversity (PD) patterns of orchid bee assemblages along a latitudinal
   gradient of 15 degrees from northern Peru to central Bolivia and to
   relate them to climatic factors and geological history. We expanded an
   existing phylogeny of orchid bees and analyzed the PD of 15 orchid bee
   assemblages along a latitudinal gradient using mean pair-wise
   phylogenetic distance. The resulting pattern was correlated to climatic
   factors and elevation. We found a hump-shaped pattern of PD that peaked
   in central Peru and decreased towards the equatorial and especially
   towards the southern, subtropical sites. The decrease in PD towards
   higher latitudes is a common pattern found in many taxa, which in our
   case correlates with increasing climatic seasonality. However, the
   decrease towards the equatorial sites is unusual and may be related to a
   particular historic event: the northern sites with low PD are situated
   in the area of the former Lake Pebas, which covered western Amazonia
   until 3 mya. After the lake disappeared orchid bees mainly belonging to
   two distantly related species groups apparently colonized the region and
   diversified, which led to the comparatively low observed PD. In
   contrast, in central Peru, no in situ radiations were detected, hence
   the assemblages were composed of species from diverse phylogenetic
   lineages. Additionally, we identified multiple phylogenetically
   independent radiations of regionally restricted Euglossa species along
   the latitudinal gradient that, according to a published, dated
   phylogeny, diversified roughly 3-1 mya. The hump-shaped latitudinal
   pattern of PD of the orchid bees of western Amazonia thus appears to
   have resulted from a preponderance of early divergent lineages in
   central Peru and of young radiations from distantly related clades
   colonizing higher latitudes, possibly triggered by historic climate
   fluctuations and major geological events.}},

Abstract = {{The ring-necked parakeet (RNP), Psittacula krameri, is an invasive
   species in Great Britain (GB) which is undergoing rapid population
   expansion in the wild. Although it has been suggested that RNPs could be
   a potential source of infectious disease, little research has been done
   on the pathogens infecting this species in GB. Psittacine beak and
   feather disease (PBFD), caused by beak and feather disease virus (BFDV),
   is an important infectious disease of psittacines, including captive
   RNPs, in GB and elsewhere. A wild RNP with marked feather abnormalities
   observed in an urban garden in London was euthanased and examined
   postmortem. Plucked contour feathers and pooled liver and spleen were
   PCR-positive for BFDV DNA. Histopathological examination of affected
   skin demonstrated BFDV-compatible lesions. A feather from another RNP
   from a different location also was PCR-positive for BFDV. This is the
   first report of PBFD in a wild free-living bird in GB. BFDV only affects
   psittacines; therefore, there is no known risk to native British birds.
   The presence of BFDV in free-living RNPs, however, could pose a disease
   threat to captive psittacines. Further work is required to determine the
   distribution and impact of BFDV infection in free-living RNPs in GB.
   Whether this case represents sporadic disease associated with
   established endemic infection or the index case of an emergent disease
   is currently unknown.}},

Title = {{Effects of directional environmental change on extinction dynamics in
   experimental microbial communities are predicted by a simple model}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{141-150}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Global temperatures are expected to rise between 1.1 and 6.4 degrees C
   over the next 100 years, although the exact rate will depend on future
   greenhouse emissions, and will vary spatially. Temperature can alter an
   individual's metabolic rate, and consequently birth and death rates. In
   declining populations, these alterations may manifest as changes in the
   rate of that population's decline, and subsequently the timing of
   extinction events. Predicting such events could therefore be of
   considerable use. We use a small-scale experimental system to
   investigate how the rate of temperature change can alter a population's
   time to extinction, and whether it is possible to predict this event
   using a simple phenomenological model that incorporates information
   about population dynamics at a constant temperature, published scaling
   of metabolic rates, and temperature. In addition, we examine 1) the
   relative importance of the direct effects of temperature on metabolic
   rate, and the indirect effects (via temperature driven changes in body
   size), on predictive accuracy (defined as the proximity of the predicted
   date of extinction to the mean observed date of extinction), 2) the
   combinations of model parameters that maximise accuracy of predictions,
   and 3) whether substituting temperature change through time with mean
   temperature produces accurate predictions. We find that extinction
   occurs earlier in environments that warm faster, and this can be
   accurately predicted (R-2 > 0.84). Increasing the number of parameters
   that were temperature-dependent increased the model's accuracy, as did
   scaling these temperature-dependent parameters with either the direct
   effects of temperature alone, or with the direct and indirect effects.
   Using mean temperature through time instead of actual temperature
   produces less accurate predictions of extinction. These results suggest
   that simple phenomenological models, incorporating metabolic theory, may
   be useful in understanding how environmental change can alter a
   population's rate of extinction.}},

Title = {{Causes of male sexual trait divergence in introduced populations of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{437-448}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Males from different populations of the same species often differ in
   their sexually selected traits. Variation in sexually selected traits
   can be attributed to sexual selection if phenotypic divergence matches
   the direction of sexual selection gradients among populations. However,
   phenotypic divergence of sexually selected traits may also be influenced
   by other factors, such as natural selection and genetic constraints.
   Here, we document differences in male sexual traits among six introduced
   Australian populations of guppies and untangle the forces driving
   divergence in these sexually selected traits. Using an experimental
   approach, we found that male size, area of orange coloration, number of
   sperm per ejaculate and linear sexual selection gradients for male
   traits differed among populations. Within populations, a large mismatch
   between the direction of selection and male traits suggests that
   constraints may be important in preventing male traits from evolving in
   the direction of selection. Among populations, however, variation in
   sexual selection explained more than half of the differences in trait
   variation, suggesting that, despite within-population constraints,
   sexual selection has contributed to population divergence of male
   traits. Differences in sexual traits were also associated with predation
   risk and neutral genetic distance. Our study highlights the importance
   of sexual selection in trait divergence in introduced populations,
   despite the presence of constraining factors such as predation risk and
   evolutionary history.}},

Abstract = {{We present uncertainties associated with the measurement of coniferous
   needle-leaf optical properties (OPs) with an integrating sphere using an
   optimized gap-fraction (GF) correction method, where GF refers to the
   air gaps appearing between the needles of a measured sample. We used an
   optically stable artificial material simulating needle leaves to
   investigate the potential effects of: 1) the sample holder carrying the
   needles during measurements and 2) multiple scattering in between the
   measured needles. Our optimization of integrating sphere port
   configurations using the sample holder showed an underestimation of the
   needle transmittance signal of at least 2\% in flat needles and 4\% in
   nonflat needles. If the needles have a nonflat cross section, multiple
   scattering of the photons during the GF measurement led to a GF
   overestimation. In addition, the multiple scattering of photons during
   the optical measurements caused less accurate performance of the
   GF-correction algorithms, which are based on the assumption of linear
   relationship between the nonGF-corrected signal and increasing GF,
   resulting in transmittance overestimation of nonflat needle samples.
   Overall, the final deviation achieved after optimizing the method is
   about 1\% in reflectance and 6\% in transmittance if the needles are
   flat, and if they are nonflat, the error increases to 4\%-6\% in
   reflectance and 10\%-12\% in transmittance. These results suggest that
   formulae for measurements and computation of coniferous needle OPs
   require modification that includes also the phenomenon of multiple
   scattering between the measured needles.}},

Abstract = {{Forest canopy cover and gap fraction are commonly usedmetrics in forest
   ecology. Airborne laser scanning is capable of measuring both very
   accurately, but slightly different estimation methods should be used as
   these metrics are defined differently. In canopy cover estimation the
   proportion of vertical gaps between the crowns is needed for a specific
   area. Canopy gap fraction includes all gaps observed from a single point
   with some angular view range. Canopy cover can be estimated with high
   accuracy as the fraction of first echoes above a specified height
   threshold, because only the large gaps are considered. In gap fraction
   estimation also last echoes should be used so that the effect of the
   smaller gaps within the crowns is considered. Leaf area index can be
   estimated from the gap fraction using a logarithmic model with a single
   coefficient representing leaf orientation. However, sensor effects have
   a strong influence on the estimates, and therefore validation with
   high-quality field data is recommended.}},

Title = {{ABC Transporters and Heavy Metals}},
Booktitle = {{PLANT ABC TRANSPORTERS}},
Series = {{Signaling and Communication in Plants}},
Year = {{2014}},
Pages = {{1-17}},
Abstract = {{The first evidence showing that ABC transporters are involved in heavy
   metal resistance in eukaryotic cells has been obtained from experiments
   in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisae, where a
   half-size transporter of the ABCB subclass and an ABCC-type transporter,
   respectively, have been shown to confer heavy metal tolerance.
   Biochemical studies have indicated that vacuolar ABC transporters should
   also play an important role in heavy metal detoxification in plants. But
   it was only recently that two ABCC-type transporters, AtABCC1 and
   AtABCC2, have been identified as major apo-phytochelatin and
   phytochelatin-heavy metal(oid) complex transporters. Several plasma
   membrane transporters have also been shown to confer heavy metal
   resistance. However, with the exception of STAR1, an UDP glucose
   exporter, which-by altering cell wall composition-confers aluminum
   tolerance, the substrates required to be transported to confer heavy
   metal resistance by these plasma membrane-localized ABC proteins are
   still not elucidated. A mitochondrial ABC transporter AtATM3 was shown
   to be required for plant growth and development. The different studies
   indicate that this transporter is important for the production of
   cytosolic iron sulfur complexes and molybdenum cofactors, prosthetic
   groups required for several enzymes. However, the final proof as to
   which substrate is transported by AtATM3 is still missing. Several
   laboratories took advantage of the fact that ABC transporters are
   involved in heavy metal tolerance to generate transgenic plants suitable
   for phytoremediation. The results show that overexpression of ABC
   proteins alone is not sufficient to produce plants that can efficiently
   decontaminate soils, but they indicate that this class of transporters,
   when combined with other transporters and enzymes involved in heavy
   metal transport and detoxification, may prove a good solution to produce
   plants that can stabilize, and in the long term clean up, soils
   contaminated with heavy metals.}},

Abstract = {{Plant functional traits can be genetically determined or phenotypically
   plastic. We assessed the degree of genetic determinism in the functional
   traits of Andean Polylepis tree species among 14 important traits that
   enable the species to withstand cold and dry conditions. We conducted a
   common garden experiment and related the species-specific means of the
   functional traits to the variables of climatic niche optima of the
   species (mean annual temperature and annual precipitation), deducing
   that if the interspecific variation in the functional trait is related
   to the species climatic niche optima according to the
   theoretically-expected pattern of climate-trait relationship, the
   variation of the trait must be genetically determined. In general, the
   traits were related either to species temperature or precipitation
   optima. For example, leaf size, maximum photosynthesis rate and root tip
   abundance were related to temperature, whereas light compensation and
   light saturation points were related to precipitation. Only leaf size
   showed a significant phylogenetic signal, indicating that most of the
   manifested climate-trait relationships are not caused purely by
   phylogeny, but are mainly a result of species specialisation along an
   environmental gradient. However, in many cases the relationships were
   rather weak. This suggests that important functional traits of Polylepis
   species involve both genetic and phenotypic components aiming to
   maximise the overall fitness of the species at high elevations.}},

Abstract = {{The geomorphology of the south-western and central Lake District,
   England is used to reconstruct the mountain palaeoglaciology pertaining
   to the Lateglacial and Younger Dryas. Limitations to previous ice-mass
   reconstructions and consequent palaeoclimatic inferences include: (i)
   the use of static (steady-state) glacier reconstructions, (ii) the
   assumption of a single-stage Younger Dryas advance, (iii) greatly
   varying ice-volume estimates, (iv) inexplicable spatial variations in
   ELA (Equilibrium Line Altitude), and (v) a lack of robust extent
   chronology. Here we present geomorphological mapping based on aerial
   photography and the NextMap Britain Digital Elevation Model, checked by
   ground survey. Former glacier extents were inferred and ELAs were
   calculated using the Balance Ratio method of Osmaston. Independently, a
   time-dependant 2-D ice-flow model was forced by a regional ELA history
   that was scaled to the GRIP record. This provided a dynamic
   reconstruction of a mountain ice field that allowed for non-steady-state
   glacier evolution. Fluctuations in climate during the Younger Dryas
   resulted in multiple glacial advance positions that show agreement with
   the location of mapped moraines, and may further explain some of the ELA
   variations found in previous local and static reconstructions. Modelling
   based on the GRIP record predicts three phases: an initial maximum
   extent, a middle minor advance or stillstand, and a pronounced but less
   extensive final advance. The comparisons find that the reconstructions
   derived from geomorphological evidence are effective representations of
   steady-state glacier geometries, but we do propose different extents for
   some glaciers and, in particular, a large former glacier in Upper
   Eskdale.}},

   salamanders}},
Journal = {{ECOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1127-1137}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Abrupt range limits of parapatric species may serve as a model system to
   understand the factors that determine species' range borders. Theory
   suggests that parapatric range limits can be caused by abiotic
   conditions along environmental gradients, biotic interactions or a
   combination of both. Geographic ranges of the parapatric salamanders,
   Salamandra salamandra and S. atra, meet in small contact zones in the
   European Alps and to date, the cause of parapatry and the restricted
   range of S. atra remain elusive. We combine multivariate approaches and
   climatic data analysis to explore niche differentiation among the two
   salamanders with respect to the available climatic environment at their
   contact zones. Our purpose is to evaluate whether climatic conditions
   explain the species' sharp range limits or if biotic interactions may
   play a role for range delimitation. Analyses were carried out in three
   contact zones in Switzerland to assess possible geographic variation.
   Our results indicate that both species occur at localities with
   different climatic conditions as well as the presence of a strong
   climatic gradient across the species' range limits. Although the
   species' climatic niches differ moderately (with a wider niche breadth
   for S. atra), interspecific niche overlap is found. Comparisons among
   the contact zones confirm geographic variation in the species' climatic
   niches as well as in the conditions within the geographically available
   space. Our results suggest that the change in climatic conditions along
   the recognized gradient represents a determining factor for species'
   range limits within contact zones. However, our analyses of geographic
   variation in climatic conditions reveal that both salamander species can
   occur in a much wider range of conditions than observed within contact
   zones. This finding and the interspecific climatic niche overlap within
   each contact zone provides indirect evidence that biotic interactions
   (likely competition) between the two species may also determine their
   range limits.}},

   intracellular pH homeostasis}},
Journal = {{PLANT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{557-568}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Intracellular pH (pHi) is a crucial parameter in cellular physiology but
   its mechanisms of homeostasis are only partially understood. To uncover
   novel roles and participants of the pHi regulatory system, we have
   screened an Arabidopsis mutant collection for resistance of seed
   germination to intracellular acidification induced by weak organic acids
   (acetic, propionic, sorbic). The phenotypes of one identified mutant,
   weak acid-tolerant 1-1D (wat1-1D) are due to the expression of a
   truncated form of AP-3 -adaptin (encoded by the PAT2 gene) that behaves
   as a as dominant-negative. During acetic acid treatment the root
   epidermal cells of the mutant maintain a higher pHi and a more
   depolarized plasma membrane electrical potential than wild-type cells.
   Additional phenotypes of wat1-1D roots include increased rates of
   acetate efflux, K+ uptake and H+ efflux, the latter reflecting the in
   vivo activity of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. The in vitro activity of
   the enzyme was not increased but, as the H+-ATPase is electrogenic, the
   increased ion permeability would allow a higher rate of H+ efflux. The
   AP-3 adaptor complex is involved in traffic from Golgi to vacuoles but
   its function in plants is not much known. The phenotypes of the wat1-1D
   mutant can be explained if loss of function of the AP-3 -adaptin causes
   activation of channels or transporters for organic anions (acetate) and
   for K+ at the plasma membrane, perhaps through miss-localization of
   tonoplast proteins. This suggests a role of this adaptin in trafficking
   of ion channels or transporters to the tonoplast.}},

Abstract = {{Bovid diets have been studied for decades, but debate still exists about
   the diets of many species, in part because of geographical or
   habitat-related dietary variations. In this study we used stable carbon
   isotope analyses of faeces to explore the seasonal dietary preferences
   of 11 bovid species from a West African savanna, the Pendjari Biosphere
   Reserve (PBR), along the browser/grazer (or C-3/C-4) continuum. We
   compare our carbon isotope values with those for eastern and southern
   African bovids, as well as with dietary predictions based on
   continent-wide averages derived from field studies. Oribi and reedbuck,
   expected to be grazers were found to be predominantly C-3-feeders
   (browsers) in the PBR. Bushbuck, common duiker and red-flanked duiker
   consumed more C-4 grass than reported in previous studies. When
   comparing wet and dry season diets, kob, roan and oribi showed the least
   variation in C-3 and C-4 plant consumed proportions, while red-flanked
   duiker, bushbuck, reedbuck and waterbuck showed the most marked shifts.
   This study shows that animals in the better-studied eastern and southern
   African savannas do not exhibit the full range of possible dietary
   adaptations. Inclusion of data from a wider geographical area to include
   less well-studied regions will inform our overall picture of bovid
   dietary ecology.}},

Abstract = {{A dedicated field experiment was conducted to investigate the response
   of a green reflectance continuum removal-based optical index, called
   area under the curve normalized to maximal band depth between 511nm and
   557nm (ANMB(511557)), to light-induced transformations in xanthophyll
   cycle pigments of Norway spruce {[}Picea abies (L.) Karst] needles. The
   performance of ANMB(511557) was compared with the photochemical
   reflectance index (PRI) computed from the same leaf reflectance
   measurements. Needles of four crown whorls (fifth, eighth, 10th, and
   15th counted from the top) were sampled from a 27-year-old spruce tree
   throughout a cloudy and a sunny day. Needle optical properties were
   measured together with the composition of the photosynthetic pigments to
   investigate their influence on both optical indices. Analyses of
   pigments showed that the needles of the examined whorls varied
   significantly in chlorophyll content and also in related pigment
   characteristics, such as the chlorophyll/carotenoid ratio. The
   investigation of the ANMB(511557) diurnal behaviour revealed that the
   index is able to follow the dynamic changes in the xanthophyll cycle
   independently of the actual content of foliar pigments. Nevertheless,
   ANMB(511557) lost the ability to predict the xanthophyll cycle behaviour
   during noon on the sunny day, when the needles were exposed to
   irradiance exceeding 1000 mol m(2) s(1). Despite this, ANMB(511557)
   rendered a better performance for tracking xanthophyll cycle reactions
   than PRI. Although declining PRI values generally responded to excessive
   solar irradiance, they were not able to predict the actual
   de-epoxidation state in the needles examined.}},

Abstract = {{A standardized bioassay previously developed with ivermectin for the
   yellow dung fly (Scathophagidae) and the face fly (Muscidae) was applied
   to test the response of 11 dung fly species to the presumably less toxic
   parasiticide moxidectin. The results were compared to existing data for
   the same species tested with ivermectin, albeit two new species
   (Scathophaga suilla and Musca domestica) were tested here with both the
   substances. Estimated lethal effect concentrations LC50 at which 50\% of
   the flies died ranged more than tenfold from 0.012 mg moxidectin/kg
   fresh dung for Sepsis neocynipsea (Sepsidae) to 0.140 mg moxidectin/kg
   fresh dung for the house fly Musca domestica (Muscidae). In most of the
   species, we additionally revealed sub-lethal effects at lower moxidectin
   concentrations in terms of retarded growth and development and reduced
   body size. Mortality thresholds were about ten times higher for
   moxidectin than for ivermectin, hence moxidectin is indeed less toxic
   than ivermectin in absolute terms. Crucially, we obtained strong
   correlations among the 11 tested fly species in both lethal and
   sub-lethal responses to the two substances, such that species relatively
   sensitive to ivermectin were also relatively sensitive to moxidectin.
   Such correlations are expected if the two substances are structurally
   related and function in the same manner by disturbing ion channel
   transport. Methodologically speaking, all species used proved suitable
   for toxicological testing of parasiticides. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Monkey alarm calls have shown that in the primate clade, combinatorial
   rules in acoustic communication are not exclusive to humans. A recent
   hypothesis suggests that the number of different call combinations in
   monkeys increases with increased number of predator species. However,
   the existence of combinatorial rules in great ape alarm calls remains
   largely unstudied, despite its obvious relevance to ideas about the
   evolution of human speech. In this paper, we examine the potential use
   of combinatorial rules in the alarm calls of the only Asian great ape:
   the orangutan. Alarm calls in orangutans are composed of syllables (with
   either one or two distinct elements), which in turn are organized into
   sequences. Tigers and clouded leopards are predators for Sumatran
   orangutans, but in Borneo, tigers are extinct. Thus, orangutans make a
   suitable great ape model to assess alarm call composition in relation to
   the size of the predator guild. We exposed orangutans on both islands to
   a tiger and control model. Response compositionality was analyzed at two
   levels (i.e., syllable and syllable sequences) between models and
   populations. Results were corroborated using information theory
   algorithms. We made specific, directed predictions for the variation
   expected if orangutans used combinatorial rules. None of these
   predictions were met, indicating that monkey alarm call combinatorial
   rules do not have direct homologues in orangutans. If these results are
   replicated in other great apes, this indicates that predation did not
   drive selection towards ever more combinatorial rules in the human
   lineage.}},

Title = {{The differentially regulated genes TvQR1 and TvPirin of the parasitic
   plant Triphysaria exhibit distinctive natural allelic diversity}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Plant parasitism represents an extraordinary interaction
   among flowering plants: parasitic plants use a specialized organ, the
   haustorium, to invade the host vascular system to deprive host plants of
   water and nutrients. Various compounds present in exudates of host
   plants trigger haustorium development. The two most effective haustorium
   inducing factors (HIFs) known for the parasitic plant Triphysaria
   versicolor (T. versicolor) are peonidin, an antioxidant flavonoid, and
   2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone (DMBQ), an oxidative stress agent. To date,
   two genes involved in haustorium initiation in T. versicolor have been
   identified: TvQR1, a quinone oxidoreductase that generates the active
   HIF from DMBQ, and TvPirin, a transcription co-factor that regulates
   several other DMBQ-responsive and -non-responsive genes. While the
   expression of these genes in response to DMBQ is well characterized,
   their expression in response to peonidin is not. In addition, the
   pattern of polymorphisms in these genes is unknown, even though
   nucleotide changes in TvQR1 and TvPirin may have contributed to the
   ability of T. versicolor to develop haustoria. To gain insights into
   these aspects, we investigated their transcriptional responses to HIFs
   and non-HIF and their natural nucleotide diversity.
   Results: Here we show that TvQR1 and TvPirin are transcriptionally
   upregulated by both DMBQ and peonidin in T. versicolor roots. Yet, while
   TvQR1 also responded to juglone, a non-HIF quinone with toxicity
   comparable to that of DMBQ, TvPirin did not. We further demonstrate that
   TvPirin encodes a protein shorter than the one previously reported. In
   the T. versicolor natural population of Northern California, TvQR1
   exhibited remarkably higher molecular diversity and more recombination
   events than TvPirin, with the highest non-synonymous substitution rate
   in the substrate recognition and catalytic domain of the TvQR1 protein.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that TvQR1 and TvPirin have most likely
   evolved highly distinct roles for haustorium formation. Unlike TvPirin,
   TvQR1 might have been under diversifying selection to maintain a diverse
   collection of polymorphisms, which might be related to the recognition
   of an assortment of HIF and non-HIF quinones as substrates for
   successful haustorial establishment in a wide range of host plants.}},

Title = {{The sensitivity of flowline models of tidewater glaciers to parameter
   uncertainty}},
Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1579-1590}},
Abstract = {{Depth-integrated (1-D) flowline models have been widely used to simulate
   fast-flowing tidewater glaciers and predict change because the
   continuous grounding line tracking, high horizontal resolution, and
   physically based calving criterion that are essential to realistic
   modeling of tidewater glaciers can easily be incorporated into the
   models while maintaining high computational efficiency. As with all
   models, the values for parameters describing ice rheology and basal
   friction must be assumed and/or tuned based on observations. For
   prognostic studies, these parameters are typically tuned so that the
   glacier matches observed thickness and speeds at an initial state, to
   which a perturbation is applied. While it is well know that ice flow
   models are sensitive to these parameters, the sensitivity of tidewater
   glacier models has not been systematically investigated. Here we
   investigate the sensitivity of such flowline models of outlet glacier
   dynamics to uncertainty in three key parameters that influence a
   glacier's resistive stress components. We find that, within typical
   observational uncertainty, similar initial (i.e., steady-state) glacier
   configurations can be produced with substantially different combinations
   of parameter values, leading to differing transient responses after a
   perturbation is applied. In cases where the glacier is initially
   grounded near flotation across a basal over-deepening, as typically
   observed for rapidly changing glaciers, these differences can be
   dramatic owing to the threshold of stability imposed by the flotation
   criterion. The simulated transient response is particularly sensitive to
   the parameterization of ice rheology: differences in ice temperature of
   similar to 2 A degrees C can determine whether the glaciers thin to
   flotation and retreat unstably or remain grounded on a marine shoal. Due
   to the highly non-linear dependence of tidewater glaciers on model
   parameters, we recommend that their predictions are accompanied by
   sensitivity tests that take parameter uncertainty into account.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral responses of animals to direct predator cues (DPCs; e.g.,
   urine) are common and may improve their survival. We investigated wild
   meerkat (Suricata suricatta) responses to DPCs by taking an experimental
   approach. When meerkats encounter a DPC they often recruit group members
   by emitting a call type, which causes the group members to interrupt
   foraging and approach the caller. The aim of this study was to identify
   the qualities of olfactory predator cues, which affect the strength of
   response by meerkats, and determine the benefits of responses to such
   cues. Experimental exposure to dog (Canis lupus) urine as a DPC revealed
   that the recruited individuals increased vigilance to fresh urine in
   comparison to older urine, whereas a higher quantity of urine did not
   induce such an effect. Both freshness and higher quantities increased
   the proportion of group members recruited. These results indicate that
   recruitment might play a crucial role in correctly assessing the current
   level of danger and that recruiting might facilitate group decision
   making. To test the prediction that the reaction to a DPC enhances early
   predator response, we presented a DPC of a predator and a control cue of
   a herbivore, and each time simultaneously moved a full-mounted caracal
   (Caracal caracal) in the vicinity of the group. Meerkats responded
   earlier to the caracal when the DPC was presented, indicating that the
   response to a DPC facilitates predator response and that they use
   information from the cue that reliably reflects the risk in the current
   moment.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical communication is ubiquitous. The identification of conserved
   structural elements in visual and acoustic communication is well
   established, but comparable information on chemical communication
   displays (CCDs) is lacking.
   We assessed the phenotypic integration of CCDs in a meta-analysis to
   characterize patterns of covariation in CCDs and identified functional
   or biosynthetically constrained modules.
   Poorly integrated plant CCDs (i.e. low covariation between scent
   compounds) support the notion that plants often utilize one or few key
   compounds to repel antagonists or to attract pollinators and enemies of
   herbivores. Animal CCDs (mostly insect pheromones) were usually more
   integrated than those of plants (i.e. stronger covariation), suggesting
   that animals communicate via fixed proportions among compounds. Both
   plant and animal CCDs were composed of modules, which are groups of
   strongly covarying compounds. Biosynthetic similarity of compounds
   revealed biosynthetic constraints in the covariation patterns of plant
   CCDs.
   We provide a novel perspective on chemical communication and a basis for
   future investigations on structural properties of CCDs. This will
   facilitate identifying modules and biosynthetic constraints that may
   affect the outcome of selection and thus provide a predictive framework
   for evolutionary trajectories of CCDs in plants and animals.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorophyll breakdown is one of the most obvious signs of leaf
   senescence and fruit ripening. The resulting yellowing of leaves can be
   observed every autumn, and the color change of fruits indicates their
   ripening state. During these processes, chlorophyll is broken down in a
   multistep pathway, now termed the `PAO/phyllobilin' pathway,
   acknowledging the core enzymatic breakdown step catalysed by
   pheophorbide a oxygenase, which determines the basic linear tetrapyrrole
   structure of the products of breakdown that are now called
   `phyllobilins'. This review provides an update on the PAO/phyllobilin
   pathway, and focuses on recent biochemical and molecular progress in
   understanding phyllobilin-modifying reactions as the basis for
   phyllobilin diversity, on the evolutionary diversity of the pathway, and
   on the transcriptional regulation of the pathway genes.}},

   rich body of theory. The high level of abstraction of the models,

   further understanding of spatial dynamics in natural systems strongly
   depends on dense exchanges between field and theory. From empiricists,
   more and specific quantifications of spatial flows are needed, defined
   by the major categories of organismal movement (dispersal, foraging,
   life-cycle, and migration). In parallel, the theoretical framework must
   account for the distinct spatial scales at which these naturally common
   spatial flows occur. Integrating all levels of spatial connections among
   landscape elements will upgrade and unify landscape and meta-ecosystem
   ecology into a single framework for spatial ecology.}},

Title = {{Sex difference and Allee effects shape the dynamics of sex-structured
   invasions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{36-46}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. The rate at which a population grows and spreads can depend on
   individual behaviour and interactions with others. In many species with
   two sexes, males and females differ in key life-history traits (e.g.
   growth, survival and dispersal), which can scale up to affect population
   rates of growth and spread. In sexually reproducing species, the
   mechanics of locating mates and reproducing successfully introduce
   further complications for predicting the invasion speed (spread rate),
   as both can change nonlinearly with density.
   2. Most models of population spread are based on one sex, or include
   limited aspects of sex differences. Here we ask whether and how the
   dynamics of finding mates interact with sex-specific life-history traits
   to influence the rate of population spread.
   3. We present a hybrid approach for modelling invasions of populations
   with two sexes that links individual-level mating behaviour (in an
   individual-based model) to population-level dynamics (in an
   integrodifference equationmodel).
   4. We find that limiting the amount of time during which individuals can
   search for mates causes a demographic Allee effect which can slow,
   delay, or even prevent an invasion. Furthermore, any sex-based
   asymmetries in life history or behaviour (skewed sex ratio, sex-biased
   dispersal, and sex-specific mating behaviours) amplify these effects. In
   contrast, allowing individuals to mate more than once ameliorates these
   effects, enabling polygynandrous populations to invade under conditions
   where monogamously mating populations would fail to establish.
   5. We show that details of individuals' mating behaviour can impact the
   rate of population spread. Based on our results, we propose a stricter
   definition of a mate-finding Allee effect, which is not met by the
   commonly used minimum mating function. Our modelling approach, which
   links individual- and population-level dynamics in a single model, may
   be useful for exploring other aspects of individual behaviour that are
   thought to impact the rate of population spread.}},

Title = {{Best practice for the use of scenarios for restoration planning}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{14-25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Scenarios are important tools to facilitate the communication among
   scientists, practitioners, and decision-makers, and, thus to support
   policy and management decisions. The use of scenarios has an enormous
   potential to reduce ecosystem restoration costs and to optimize
   benefits, but this potential remains poorly explored. Here, we recommend
   and illustrate six best practices to guide the use of scenarios for
   planning native ecosystem restoration. We argue, first, for a
   participatory process to consider aspirations of multiple stakeholders
   along the whole scenario building process, from planning to
   implementation and review phases. Second, targeted restoration outcomes
   should be defined by key-actors (those who have direct interests in
   restoration) and directly involved stakeholders, within a clear
   socio-environmental context and under a well-defined problem statement,
   considering a broad range of nature and human benefits that can be
   derived from ecosystem restoration. Third, methodological choices, such
   as scenario types, spatial and temporal scales, drivers,
   restoration-related variables, and indicators, should be defined
   according to the multiple desired outcomes. Fourth, we encourage the
   consideration of the interactions among variables, within a spatially
   explicit, and temporally dynamic multi-criteria approach. Fifth,
   analysis and dissemination of scenario results should highlight the
   trade-offs and synergies among different restoration outcomes,
   identifying the scenarios that maximize benefits and minimize costs and
   resistance (i.e. the cost-effective and most feasible scenario) for
   multiple targets. Finally, promoting capacity building, through a wider
   consultation process including interaction with a broader group of
   stakeholders, is critical for the successful implementation and review
   of restoration interventions. Scenarios that support ecosystem
   restoration should follow an adaptive and iterative process, aiming to
   continuously improve restoration interventions and outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Humans have interacted with fire for thousands of years, yet the
   utilization of fossil fuels marked the beginning of a new era.
   Ubiquitous in the environment, pyrogenic carbon (PyC) arises from
   incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels, forming a continuum
   of condensed aromatic structures. Here, we develop and evaluate C-14
   records for two complementary PyC molecular markers, benzene
   polycarboxylic acids (BPCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs), preserved in aquatic sediments from a suburban and a remote
   catchment in the United States (U.S.) from the mid-1700s to 1998.
   Results show that the majority of PyC stems from local sources and is
   transferred to aquatic sedimentary archives on subdecadal to millennial
   time scales. Whereas a small portion stems from near-contemporaneous
   production and sedimentation, the majority of PyC (similar to 90\%)
   experiences delayed transmission due to ``preaging{''} on millennial
   time scales in catchment soils prior to its ultimate deposition. BPCAs
   (soot) and PAHs (precursors of soot) trace fossil fuel-derived PyC. Both
   markers parallel historical records of the consumption of fossil fuels
   in the U.S., yet never account for more than 19\% total PyC. This study
   demonstrates that isotopic characterization of multiple tracers is
   necessary to constrain histories and inventories of PyC and that
   sequestration of PyC can markedly lag its production.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how the natural world will be impacted by environmental
   change over the coming decades is one of the most pressing challenges
   facing humanity. Addressing this challenge is difficult because
   environmental change can generate both population-level plastic and
   evolutionary responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or
   nonadaptive. We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic
   theory with data-driven structured models to allow prediction of
   population responses to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive
   evolution. After introducing general new theory, we construct a number
   of example models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to
   environmental change over the short-term will be considerably slower
   than plastic responses and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new
   environment depends on whether plastic responses are adaptive or
   nonadaptive. Parameterization of the models we develop requires
   information on genetic and phenotypic variation and demography that will
   not always be available, meaning that simpler models will often be
   required to predict responses to environmental change. We consequently
   develop a method to examine whether the full machinery of the
   evolutionarily explicit models we develop will be needed to predict
   responses to environmental change or whether simpler nonevolutionary
   models that are now widely constructed may be sufficient.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria secrete a variety of compounds important for nutrient
   scavenging, competition mediation and infection establishment. While
   there is a general consensus that secreted compounds can be shared and
   therefore have social consequences for the bacterial collective, we know
   little about the physical limits of such bacterial social interactions.
   Here, we address this issue by studying the sharing of iron-scavenging
   siderophores between surfaceattached microcolonies of the bacterium
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using single-cell fluorescence microscopy, we
   show that siderophores, secreted by producers, quickly reach
   non-producers within a range of 100 mm, and significantly boost their
   fitness. Producers in turn respond to variation in sharing efficiency by
   adjusting their pyoverdine investment levels. These social effects wane
   with larger cell-to-cell distances and on hard surfaces. Thus, our
   findings reveal the boundaries of compound sharing, and show that
   sharing is particularly relevant between nearby yet physically separated
   bacteria on soft surfaces, matching realistic natural conditions such as
   those encountered in soft tissue infections.}},

Abstract = {{Polyploidy is widely considered as a major process in the evolution of
   plants but the accumulation of polyploid species diversity is still
   controversial. Some recent studies proposed increased extinction risk in
   neopolyploids compared with their diploid ancestors. The high proportion
   of polyploid ferns is expected to be formed mainly by neopolyploids,
   whereas paleopolyploid species are predicted to be clustered in clades
   founded by whole genome duplications. Here, we test this prediction by
   exploring the evolution of polyploidy in the derived fern family
   Aspleniaceae. The family has a global distribution and shows the highest
   frequency of polyploid taxa among all ferns. To test the hypothesis, we
   obtained a comprehensive phylogeny using chloroplast DNA sequences of
   883 specimens representing 292 species. All published chromosome counts
   were mapped onto this phylogenetic framework in order to explore the
   evolution of polyploids. We recovered evidence for several whole genome
   duplications in the history of Aspleniaceae. Phylogenetic relationships
   of polyploids exceeding the tetraploid level suggest that tetraploid
   Asplenium species may have replaced their diploid ancestors as the main
   evolutionary players in some clades of this family.}},

Abstract = {{Sentinel-1A and -1B are twin spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   sensors developed and operated by the European Space Agency under the
   auspices of the Copernicus Earth observation programme. Launched in
   April 2014 and April 2016, Sentinel-1A and -1B are currently operating
   in tandem, in a common orbital configuration to provide an increased
   revisit frequency. In-orbit commissioning was completed for each unit
   within months of their respective launches, and level-1 SAR products
   generated by the operational SAR processor have been geometrically
   calibrated. In order to compare and monitor the geometric
   characteristics of the level-1 products from both units, as well as to
   investigate potential improvements, products from both satellites have
   been monitored since their respective commissioning phases. In this
   study, we present geolocation accuracy estimates for both Sentinel-1
   units based on the time series of level-1 products collected thus far.
   While both units were demonstrated to be performing consistently, and
   providing SAR data products according to the nominal product
   specifications, a subtle beam- and mode-dependent azimuth bias common to
   the data from both units was identified. A method for removing the bias
   is proposed, and the corresponding improvement to the geometric
   accuracies is demonstrated and quantified.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the drivers and limits of species radiations is a crucial
   goal of evolutionary genetics and molecular ecology, yet research on
   this topic has been hampered by the notorious difficulty of connecting
   micro- and macroevolutionary approaches to studying the drivers of
   diversification. To chart the current research gaps, opportunities and
   challenges of molecular ecology approaches to studying radiations, we
   examine the literature in the journal Molecular Ecology and revisit
   recent high-profile examples of evolutionary genomic research on
   radiations. We find that available studies of radiations are highly
   unevenly distributed among taxa, with many ecologically important and
   species-rich organismal groups remaining severely understudied,
   including arthropods, plants and fungi. Most studies employed molecular
   methods suitable over either short or long evolutionary time scales,
   such as microsatellites or restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
   (RAD-seq) in the former case and conventional amplicon sequencing of
   organellar DNA in the latter. The potential of molecular ecology studies
   to address and resolve patterns and processes around the species level
   in radiating groups of taxa is currently limited primarily by sample
   size and a dearth of information on radiating nuclear genomes as opposed
   to organellar ones. Based on our literature survey and personal
   experience, we suggest possible ways forward in the coming years. We
   touch on the potential and current limitations of whole-genome
   sequencing (WGS) in studies of radiations. We suggest that WGS and
   targeted (capture') resequencing emerge as the methods of choice for
   scaling up the sampling of populations, species and genomes, including
   currently understudied organismal groups and the genes or regulatory
   elements expected to matter most to species radiations.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{2, SI}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Through their preferences for floral cues, pollinators and herbivores
   can mediate selection on a variety of plant traits. Selection by
   mutualists and antagonists may not be independent from each other,
   however, as the selection on a trait through one interaction can depend
   on the presence or intensity of another interaction. Bumble bees (Bombus
   terrestris) and cabbage butterflies (Pieris brassicae) are both
   pollinators of Brassica rapa, but cabbage butterflies also use B. rapa
   as a host plant for their caterpillars. In a cage experiment we exposed
   B. rapa plants to (a) bumble bees, (b) cabbage butterflies, and (c)
   bumble bees and cabbage butterflies together and analysed the resulting
   patterns of selection. We found an association between flower visitation
   and corolla size as well as the scent compound phenylacetaldehyde for
   both bumble bees and cabbage butterflies. Additionally, oviposition by
   butterflies was associated with the same two floral signals. Whereas
   corolla size was under positive selection in all three pollinator
   treatments, selection on phenylacetaldehyde was found only in the
   ``pure{''} bumble bee treatment. Additionally, in plants exposed to both
   insect species negative correlational selection on corolla size and
   phenylacetaldehyde was found, as well as nonadditive selection on
   phenylacetaldehyde. These results demonstrate a strong overlap in the
   preferences for floral traits in pollinators and herbivores causing a
   conflict between the attraction of mutualists and the avoidance of
   antagonists. Further, our study shows that interactive effects on
   fitness by mutualists and antagonists can contribute to complex
   selection patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Reproduction has been the privileged site of post-colonial eugenic
   politics through which the future national body is regulated in racial
   terms. Nikolas Rose argues that new forms of liberal eugenics have
   replaced traditional state biopolitics. In the current bioeconomy, it is
   no longer the state but active consumers that make (racialized)
   reproductive choices. The market of assisted reproductive technologies
   (ART) in Mexico serves as an empirical case to argue that the liberal
   eugenics practiced in this market recasts rather than replaces
   traditional state biopolitics. This becomes evident in (1) the
   racialized access to surrogacy programs in Mexico and (2) in giving
   higher value to white sex cells, while (3) devaluing the genetic traits
   of non-white women through the selection and classification processes of
   reproductive laborers. Analyzing the transnational geographies of
   surrogacy markets in Mexico, the article investigates how future bodies
   are whitened through biomedical practices and consumer choices that are
   shaped by and simultaneously reinforce (post-) colonial imaginaries of

Title = {{Novel opsin gene variation in large-bodied, diurnal lemurs}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{` Some primate populations include both trichromatic and dichromatic
   (red-green colour blind) individuals due to allelic variation at the
   X-linked opsin locus. This polymorphic trichromacy is well described in
   day-active New World monkeys. Less is known about colour vision in
   Malagasy lemurs, but, unlike New World monkeys, only some day-active
   lemurs are polymorphic, while others are dichromatic. The evolutionary
   pressures underlying these differences in lemurs are unknown, but
   aspects of species ecology, including variation in activity pattern, are
   hypothesized to play a role. Limited data on X-linked opsin variation in
   lemurs make such hypotheses difficult to evaluate. We provide the first
   detailed examination of X-linked opsin variation across a lemur clade
   (Indriidae). We sequenced the X-linked opsin in the most strictly
   diurnal and largest extant lemur, Indri indri, and nine species of
   smaller, generally diurnal indriids (Propithecus). Although nocturnal
   Avahi (sister taxon to Propithecus) lacks a polymorphism, at least eight
   species of diurnal indriids have two or more X-linked opsin alleles.
   Four rainforest-living taxa-I. indri and the three largest Propithecus
   species-have alleles not previously documented in lemurs. Moreover, we
   identified at least three opsin alleles in Indri with peak spectral
   sensitivities similar to some New World monkeys.}},

Abstract = {{Developing models for the prediction of microbial biotransformation
   pathways and half-lives of trace organic contaminants in different
   environments requires as training data easily accessible and
   sufficiently large collections of respective biotransformation data that
   are annotated with metadata on study conditions. Here, we present the
   Eawag-Soil package, a public database that has been developed to contain
   all freely accessible regulatory data on pesticide degradation in
   laboratory soil simulation studies for pesticides registered in the EU
   (282 degradation pathways, 1535 reactions, 1619 compounds and 4716
   biotransformation half-life values with corresponding metadata on study
   conditions). We provide a thorough description of this novel data
   resource, and discuss important features of the pesticide soil
   degradation data that are relevant for model development. Most notably,
   the variability of half-life values for individual compounds is large
   and only about one order of magnitude lower than the entire range of
   median half-life values spanned by all compounds, demonstrating the need
   to consider study conditions in the development of more accurate models
   for biotransformation prediction. We further show how the data can be
   used to find missing rules relevant for predicting soil
   biotransformation pathways. From this analysis, eight examples of
   reaction types were presented that should trigger the formulation of new
   biotransformation rules, e.g., Ar-OH methylation, or the extension of
   existing rules, e.g., hydroxylation in aliphatic rings. The data were
   also used to exemplarily explore the dependence of half-lives of
   different amide pesticides on chemical class and experimental
   parameters. This analysis highlighted the value of considering initial
   transformation reactions for the development of meaningful
   quantitative-structure biotransformation relationships (QSBR), which is
   a novel opportunity offered by the simultaneous encoding of
   transformation reactions and corresponding half-lives in Eawag-Soil.
   Overall, Eawag-Soil provides an unprecedentedly rich collection of
   manually extracted and curated biotransformation data, which should be
   useful in a great variety of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Plants reorganize their root architecture to avoid growth into
   unfavorable regions of the rhizosphere. In a screen based on chimeric
   repressor gene-silencing technology, we identified the Arabidopsis
   thaliana GeBP-LIKE 4 (GPL4) transcription factor as an inhibitor of root
   growth that is induced rapidly in root tips in response to cadmium (Cd).
   We tested the hypothesis that GPL4 functions in the root avoidance of Cd
   by analyzing root proliferation in split medium, in which only half of
   the medium contained toxic concentrations of Cd. The wild-type (WT)
   plants exhibited root avoidance by inhibiting root growth in the Cd side
   but increasing root biomass in the control side. By contrast,
   GPL4-suppression lines exhibited nearly comparable root growth in the Cd
   and control sides and accumulated more Cd in the shoots than did the WT.
   GPL4 suppression also altered the root avoidance of toxic concentrations
   of other essential metals, modulated the expression of many genes
   related to oxidative stress, and consistently decreased reactive oxygen
   species concentrations. We suggest that GPL4 inhibits the growth of
   roots exposed to toxic metals by modulating reactive oxygen species
   concentrations, thereby allowing roots to colonize noncontaminated
   regions of the rhizosphere.}},

Title = {{Cross-Comparison of Albedo Products for Glacier Surfaces Derived from
   Airborne and Satellite (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) Optical Data}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Surface albedo partitions the amount of energy received by glacier
   surfaces from shortwave fluxes and modulates the energy available for
   melt processes. The ice-albedo feedback, influenced by the contamination
   of bare-ice surfaces with light-absorbing impurities, plays a major role
   in the melting of mountain glaciers in a warming climate. However,
   little is known about the spatial and temporal distribution and
   variability of bare-ice glacier surface albedo under changing
   conditions. In this study, we focus on two mountain glaciers located in
   the western Swiss Alps and perform a cross-comparison of different
   albedo products. We take advantage of high spectral and spatial
   resolution (284 bands, 2 m) imaging spectrometer data from the Airborne
   Prism Experiment (APEX) and investigate the applicability and potential
   of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data to derive broadband albedo products.
   The performance of shortwave broadband albedo retrievals is tested and
   we assess the reliability of published narrow-to-broadband conversion
   algorithms. The resulting albedo products from the three sensors and
   different algorithms are further cross-compared. Moreover, the impact of
   the anisotropy correction is analysed depending on different surface
   types. While degradation of the spectral resolution impacted
   glacier-wide mean albedo by about 5\%, reducing the spatial resolution
   resulted in changes of less than 1\%. However, in any case, coarser
   spatial resolution was no longer able to represent small-scale
   variability of albedo on glacier surfaces. We discuss the implications
   when using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 to map dynamic glaciological
   processes and to monitor glacier surface albedo on larger spatial and
   more frequent temporal scales.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous landscape genomic studies have identified single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes potentially involved in local adaptation.
   Rarely, it has been explicitly evaluated whether these environmental
   associations also hold true beyond the populations studied. We tested
   whether putatively adaptive SNPs in Arabidopsis halleri (Brassicaceae),
   characterized in a previous study investigating local adaptation to a
   highly heterogeneous environment, show the same environmental
   associations in an independent, geographically enlarged set of 18
   populations. We analysed new SNP data of 444 plants with the same
   methodology (partial Mantel tests, PMTs) as in the original study and
   additionally with a latent factor mixed model (LFMM) approach. Of the 74
   candidate SNPs, 41\% (PMTs) and 51\% (LFMM) were associated with
   environmental factors in the independent data set. However, only 5\%
   (PMTs) and 15\% (LFMM) of the associations showed the same
   environment-allele relationships as in the original study. In total, we
   found 11 genes (31\%) containing the same association in the original
   and independent data set. These can be considered prime candidate genes
   for environmental adaptation at a broader geographical scale. Our
   results suggest that selection pressures in highly heterogeneous alpine
   environments vary locally and signatures of selection are likely to be
   population-specific. Thus, genotype-by-environment interactions
   underlying adaptation are more heterogeneous and complex than is often
   assumed, which might represent a problem when testing for adaptation at
   specific loci.}},

   flood, originating from the outburst of the Parchu Lake, was not related
   to heavy precipitation, but was likely enhanced by the rapid and late
   snowmelt of an unusually deep and widespread snowpack. The flood in 2000
   was triggered by the outburst of an unnamed lake located on the Tibetan
   plateau, identified here for the first time. In this case, the outburst
   followed intense precipitation in the lake watershed, which raised the
   level of the lake and thus caused the breaching of the dam. As stream
   gauges were damaged during the events detailed discharge data is not
   available, but we estimated the peak discharges ranging between 1100
   m(3) s(-1) and 2000 m(3) s(-1) in 2005, and 1024 m(3) s(-1) and 1800
   m(3) s(-1) in 2000. These events caused significant geomorphic changes
   along the river valleys, with observed changes in channel width
   exceeding 200 m. Results also demonstrate that remotely-sensed data
   enables valuable large-scale monitoring of lake development and related
   hydrometeorological conditions, and may thereby inform early warning
   strategies, and provide a basis for flood risk reduction measures that
   focus on disaster preparedness and response strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Soils, paleosols and terrestrial sediments serve as archives for
   studying climate change, and represent important terrestrial carbon
   pools. Archive functioning relies on the chronological integrity of the
   respective units. Incorporation of younger organic matter (OM) e.g. by
   plant roots and associated microorganisms into deep subsoil and
   underlying soil parent material may reduce reliability of
   paleoenvironmental records and stability of buried OM. Long-term effects
   of sedimentary characteristics and deep rooting on deep subsoil
   microbial communities remain largely unknown. We characterized fossil
   and living microbial communities based on molecular markers in a Central
   European Late Pleistocene loess-paleosol sequence containing recent and
   ancient roots with ages of several millenia. The molecular approach,
   comprising free and phospholipid fatty acids (FAs), core and intact
   polar glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), as well as 16S rRNA
   genes from bacterial DNA, revealed the presence of living microorganisms
   along the sequence, with bacterial community composition comparable to
   that of modern topsoils. Up to 88\% redundancy between bacterial genetic
   fingerprint and molecular signature of fossil microorganisms suggested a
   time-integrated signal of the molecular markers accumulated over a time
   span potentially lasting from sedimentation over one or more rooting
   phases until today. Free FAs, core GDGTs and DNA, considered as remains
   of fossil microorganisms, corresponded with ancient and recent root
   quantities, whereas phospholipid FAs and intact polar GDGTs, presumably
   derived from living microorganisms, correlated only with living roots.
   The biogeochemical and ecological disequilibrium induced by
   postsedimentary rooting may entail long-term microbial processes like OM
   mineralization, which may continue even millenia after the lifetime of
   the root. Deep roots and their fossil remains have been observed in
   various terrestrial settings, and roots as well as associated
   microorganisms cause both, OM incorporation and mineralization.
   Therefore, these findings are crucial for improved understanding of OM
   dynamics and carbon sequestration potential in deep subsoils. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Flood early warning systems play a major role in the disaster risk
   reduction paradigm as cost-effective methods to mitigate flood disaster
   damage. The connections and feedbacks between the hydrological and
   social spheres of early warning systems are increasingly being
   considered as key aspects for successful flood mitigation. The behavior
   of the public and first responders during flood situations, determined
   by their preparedness, is heavily influenced by many behavioral traits
   such as perceived benefits, risk awareness, or even denial. In this
   study, we use the recency of flood experiences as a proxy for social
   preparedness to assess its impact on the efficiency of flood early
   warning systems through a simple stylized model and implemented this
   model using a simple mathematical description. The main findings, which
   are based on synthetic data, point to the importance of social
   preparedness for flood loss mitigation, especially in circumstances
   where the technical forecasting and warning capabilities are limited.
   Furthermore, we found that efforts to promote and preserve social
   preparedness may help to reduce disaster-induced losses by almost one
   half. The findings provide important insights into the role of social
   preparedness that may help guide decision-making in the field of flood
   early warning systems.}},

Abstract = {{The global amphibian trade is suspected to have brought several species
   to the brink of extinction, and has led to the spread of amphibian
   pathogens. Moreover, international trade is not regulated for similar to
   98 \% of species. Here we outline patterns and complexity underlying
   global amphibian trade, highlighting some loopholes that need to be
   addressed, focusing on the European Union. In spite of being one of the
   leading amphibian importers, the EU's current legislation is
   insufficient to prevent overharvesting of those species in demand or the
   introduction and/or spread of amphibian pathogens into captive and wild
   populations. We suggest steps to improve the policy (implementation and
   enforcement) framework, including (i) an identifier specifically for
   amphibians in the World Customs Organisation's harmonised system, (ii)
   Parties to CITES should strive to include more species in the CITES
   appendices, and (iii) restriction or suspension of trade of threatened
   species, restricted-range species, and species protected in their
   country of origin. Commercial trade should not put survival of amphibian
   species further at risk.}},

Abstract = {{Organizational processes during prenatal development can have long-term
   effects on an individual's phenotype. Because these early developmental
   stages are sensitive to environmental influences, mothers are in a
   unique position to alter their offspring's phenotype by differentially
   allocating resources to their developing young. However, such prenatal
   maternal effects are difficult to disentangle from other forms of
   parental care, additive genetic effects, and/or other forms of maternal
   inheritance, hampering our understanding of their evolutionary
   consequences. Here we used divergent selection lines for high and low
   prenatal maternal investment and their reciprocal line crosses in a
   precocial birdthe Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)to quantify the
   relative importance of genes and prenatal maternal effects in shaping
   offspring phenotype. Maternal but not paternal origin strongly affected
   offspring body size and survival throughout development. Although the
   effects of maternal egg investment faded over time, they were large at
   key life stages. Additionally, there was evidence for other forms of
   maternal inheritance affecting offspring phenotype at later stages of
   development. Our study is among the first to successfully disentangle
   prenatal maternal effects from all other sources of confounding
   variation and highlights the important role of prenatal maternal
   provisioning in shaping offspring traits closely linked to fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Group-level cooperation often poses a social dilemma in which joint
   action may be difficult to achieve. Theoretical models and experimental
   work on humans show that social incentives, such as punishment of
   defectors and rewarding of cooperators, can promote cooperation in
   groups of unrelated individuals. Here, we demonstrate that these
   processes can operate in a non-human animal species, and be used to
   effectively promote the production of a public good. We took advantage
   of the fact that intergroup fights in vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus
   aethiops pygerythrus) are characterized by episodes of intergroup
   aggression with pauses in-between. During pauses, females selectively
   groomed males that had participated in the previous aggressive episode,
   but aggressed male group members that had not. In subsequent (i.e.
   future) episodes, males who had received either aggression or grooming
   participated above their personal base-line level. Therefore,
   female-male aggression and grooming both appear to function as social
   incentives that effectively promote male participation in intergroup
   fights. Importantly, females stood to gain much from recruiting males as
   the probability of winning intergroup fights was dependent on the number
   of active participants, relative to the number of fighters in the
   opposing group. Furthermore, females appear to maximize the benefits
   gained from recruiting males as they primarily used social incentives
   where and when high-quality food resources, which are the resources
   primarily limiting to female fitness, were at stake.}},

Abstract = {{During senescence, chlorophyll is broken down to a set of structurally
   similar, but distinct linear tetrapyrrolic compounds termed
   phyllobilins. Structure identification of phyllobilins from over a dozen
   plant species revealed that modifications at different peripheral
   positions may cause complex phyllobilin composition in a given species.
   For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type, eight different
   phyllobilins have structurally been characterized to date. Accurate
   phyllobilin identification and quantification, which classically have
   been performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
   UV/vis detection, are, however, hampered because of their similar
   physiochemical properties and vastly differing abundances in plant
   extracts. Here we established a rapid method for phyllobilin
   identification and quantification that couples ultra-HPLC with
   high-resolution/high-precision tandem mass spectrometry. Using
   Arabidopsis wild-type and mutant lines that are deficient in specific
   phyllobilin-modifying reactions, we identified a total of 16
   phyllobilins, among them two that have not been described before in
   Arabidopsis. The single and collision-induced dissociation tandem mass
   spectrometry data of all 16 Arabidopsis phyllobilins were collected in a
   mass spectrometry library, which is available to the scientific
   community. The library allows rapid detection and quantification of
   phyllobilins within and across Arabidopsis genotypes and we demonstrate
   its potential use for high-throughput approaches and genome-wide
   association studies in chlorophyll breakdown. By extending the library
   with phyllobilin data from other plant species in the future, we aim
   providing a tool for chlorophyll metabolite analysis as a measure of
   senescence for practical applications, such as post-harvest quality
   control.
   Significance Statement Phyllobilins have similar physiochemical
   properties and vastly differing abundance in plant extracts, thus
   accurate identification and quantification is challenging. Here we
   describe a LC-MS/MS platform that allows their simultaneous detection
   and quantification within extracts of senescent Arabidopsis thaliana
   leaves. This MS/MS spectral data can be referenced when analyzing
   Arabidopsis senescence mutants and ecotypes and should prove useful for
   comparative analyses of chlorophyll breakdown in other species.}},

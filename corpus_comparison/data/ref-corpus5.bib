Title = {{A new commelinid monocot seed fossil from the early Eocene previously

Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Fossils provide minimum age estimates for extant
   lineages. Here we critically evaluate Cantisolanum daturoides Reid \&
   Chandler and two other early putative seed fossils of Solanaceae, an
   economically important plant family in the Asteridae.
   METHODS: Three earliest seed fossil taxa of Solanaceae from the London
   Clay Formation (Cantisolanum daturoides) and the Poole and Branksome
   Sand Formations (Solanum arnense Chandler and Solanispermum reniforme
   Chandler) were studied using x-ray microcomputed tomography (MCT) and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
   KEY RESULTS: The MCT scans of Cantisolanum daturoides revealed a high
   level of pyrite preservation at the cellular level. Cantisolanum
   daturoides can be clearly excluded from Solanaceae and has more
   affinities to the commelinid monocots based on a straight longitudinal
   axis, a prominent single layer of relatively thin-walled cells in the
   testa, and a clearly differentiated micropyle surrounded by radially
   elongated and inwardly curved testal cells. While the MCT scans show no
   internal preservation in Solanum arnense and Solanispermum reniforme,
   SEM images show the presence of several characteristics that allow the
   placement of these taxa at the stem node of Solanaceae.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cantisolanum daturoides is likely a member of commelinid
   monocots and not Solanaceae as previously suggested. The earliest fossil
   record of Solanaceae is revised to consist of fruit fossil with inflated
   calyces from the early Eocene of Patagonia (52 Ma) and fossilized seeds
   from the early to mid-Eocene of Europe (48-46 Ma). The new identity for
   Cantisolanum daturoides does not alter a late Cretaceous minimum age for
   commelinids.}},

Abstract = {{This study empirically investigates the potential of auditory displays
   for spatial data exploration, as an additional means to broaden the
   accessibility and dissemination of geographic information for a diverse
   body of users. In a mixed factorial experiment, three parameter mapping
   sonification methods are empirically evaluated to interactively explore
   discrete and continuous digital elevation models by auditory means.
   Contrasting prior sonification research, this study's unique empirical
   evidence suggests that participants can indeed successfully interpret
   sonified displays containing continuous spatial data. Specifically, the
   auditory variable pitch leads to significantly better response accuracy,
   compared to the sound variable duration. Background and training has a
   weak effect on data interpretation performance with the auditory
   display. The more immersive the experienced soundscape, the better
   participants can interpret the sonified terrain. These encouraging
   empirical results indeed suggest that interactive auditory displays
   might offer additional means to disseminate spatial information, and to
   increase the accessibility to spatial data, beyond the currently
   dominant visual paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate ecosystems are susceptible to drought events. The effect of a
   severe drought (104 days) followed by irrigation on the plant C uptake,
   its assimilation and input of C in soil were examined using a triple
   (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase labelling experiment in model grassland and
   heathland ecosystems. First (CO2)-C-13 pulse at day 0 of the experiment
   revealed much higher C-13 tracer uptake for shoots, roots and soil
   compared to the second pulse (day 44), where all plants showed
   significantly lower C-13 tracer uptake. After the third (CO2)-C-13 pulse
   (day 70), very low C-13 uptake in shoots led to a negligible allocation
   of C-13 into roots and soil. During irrigation after the severe drought,
   the C-13 tracer that was allocated in plant tissues during the second
   and third pulse labelling was re-allocated in roots and soil, as soon as
   the irrigation started. This re-allocation was higher and longer lasting
   in heathland compared to grassland ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing data analysis is knowing an unprecedented upswing
   fostered by the activities of the public and private sectors of
   geospatial and environmental data analysis. Modern imaging sensors offer
   the necessary spatial and spectral information to tackle a wide range
   problems through Earth Observation, such as land cover and use updating,
   urban dynamics, or vegetation and crop monitoring. In the upcoming years
   even richer information will be available: more sophisticated
   hyperspectral sensors with high spectral resolution, multispectral
   sensors with sub-metric spatial detail or drones that can be deployed in
   very short time lapses. Besides such opportunities, these new and
   wealthy information sources also come with a price: the analysts are
   confronted with data showing large and complex feature characteristics.
   To deal with these new challenges, kernel methods have emerged as a
   valid, robust and successful framework. The intrinsic regularization
   implemented in these methods and their low sensitivity to data
   dimensionality make them natural candidates to solve current remote
   sensing problems. The flexibility offered by kernel methods allows us to
   treat heavily nonlinear tasks with elegant methodologies, while still
   using linear algebra. In the last decade, kernel methods in general, and
   support vector machines for classification and Gaussian processes for
   regression in particular, have become standard tools for geospatial data
   analysis. In this chapter, we first review the main concepts about
   kernel methods and their use in remote sensing. Then, we review examples
   of kernel methods for remote sensing image classification and
   biophysical parameter retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous initiatives are currently trying to reform eastern Democratic
   Republic of the Congo's (DRC) ill-reputed artisanal and small-scale
   mining (ASM) sector through formalisation, traceability, and
   certification of the region's trade in tantalum, tin, and tungsten (3T).
   While this ethically driven impetus derives from consumer pressure
   following numerous reports on the militarisation of the area's ASM
   sector and concomitant human rights abuses, the ability of the resulting
   initiatives to address these problems remains unclear. In this paper, we
   enhance long-term qualitative research with an experimental quantitative
   survey to generate insights into two questions: how has the
   formalisation of eastern DRC's resource markets, through traceability
   and certification, altered the socio-economic dynamics around artisanal
   mines and trading routes? What is its actual impact on the everyday life
   of miners, their families, and associated professions? Based on in-depth
   research in South Kivu, a pioneer case for traceability and
   certification of 3T mining, we demonstrate the ambiguous outcome of
   these reforms so far and analyse how they threaten an informal ASM
   sector already in jeopardy. In figurative terms, the artisanal miners
   themselves have become a proverbial `miner's canary' whose livelihoods
   are increasingly under stress in sequence to formalisation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The stockpersons handling the transportation of animals between farms
   and slaughterhouses are rarely assessed for their animal welfare
   knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP). Thus, this investigation
   presents a unique opportunity to study these interactions. Herein, a
   cross-sectional survey was carried out among 266 stockpersons in 10
   Kenyan livestock markets to determine their animal welfare KAP. The
   survey questionnaire was based on Kenya's Regulations for Animal
   Transport (Act No: CAP. 360-L.N. 119/1984). Mean percentage scores for
   knowledge, attitudes, and practices were 78.0 +/- 14.1, 75.6 +/- 16.0,
   and 64.5 +/- 17.6, respectively. From the responses to statements
   related to animal husbandry, practices of the housing of unfamiliar
   groups of animals, cooperation with other stakeholders, and stress
   caused to animals during handling, it was found that stockpersons'
   animal welfare KAP was inadequate. Women aged > 50 years or having more
   than 10 years of experience had significantly higher levels of animal
   welfare KAP (p < 0.05). In conclusion, although Kenyan stockpersons may
   score adequately on the parameters of animal welfare knowledge and
   attitudes, their followed practices are poor, which may possibly be
   influenced by gender, age, or level of experience.}},

   clades of the tribe. We study the leaf morphology and anatomy of 20
   selected species of Senecio s.l., embracing representatives of all
   distinct groups of leaf succulents in Senecioneae, and contrast the
   results with a molecular phylogeny derived from ITS sequence data. The
   leaves of the studied species vary as to their gross appearance (flat to
   terete, horizontally or seemingly vertically oriented, with or without
   `window' areas) as well as with respect to their macro-anatomy (tissue
   succulence vs. all-cell succulence). The morphological and anatomical
   characterizations of identified groups correlate well with the clades
   found in the ITS-based molecular phylogenetic studies, and the
   reclassification of succulent-leaved species of Senecio s.l. into the
   segregate genera Caputia, Kleinia and Curio is strongly supported. Leaf
   characters provide easy-to-observe diagnostic characters to recognize
   the three genera.}},

Title = {{Tooth occlusal morphology in the durophagous marine reptiles,

Abstract = {{Placodontia were a group of marine reptiles that lived in shallow
   nearshore environments during the Triassic. Based on tooth morphology it
   has been inferred that they were durophagous, but tooth morphology
   differs among species: placodontoid placodonts have teeth described as
   hemispherical, and the teeth of more highly nested taxa within the
   cyamodontoid placodonts have been described as flat. In contrast, the
   sister taxon to the placodonts, Palatodonta bleekeri, like many other
   marine reptiles, has tall pointed teeth for eating soft-bodied prey. The
   goals of this paper are to quantify these different tooth morphologies
   and compare tooth shape among taxa and with a functionally ``optimal{''}
   tooth. To quantify tooth morphology we measured the radius of curvature
   (RoC) of the occlusal surface by fitting spheres to 3D surface scans or
   computed microtomographic scans. Large RoCs correspond to flatter teeth,
   while teeth with smaller RoCs are pointier; positive RoCs have convex
   occlusal surfaces, and a negative RoC indicates that the occlusal
   surface of the tooth is concave. We found the placodontoid taxa have
   teeth with smaller RoCs than more highly nested taxa, and palatine teeth
   tend to be flatter and closer to the optimal morphology than maxillary
   teeth. Within one well-nested clade, the placochelyids, the rearmost
   palatine teeth have a more complex morphology than the predicted optimal
   tooth, with an overall concave occlusal surface with a small, medial
   cusp. These findings are in keeping with the hypothesis that placodonts
   were specialized durophagous predators with teeth modified to break hard
   prey items while resisting tooth failure.}},

Abstract = {{Range expansions and biological invasions are prime examples of
   transient processes that are likely impacted by rapid evolutionary
   changes. As a spatial process, range expansions are driven by dispersal
   and movement behaviour. Although it is widely accepted that dispersal
   and movement may be context-dependent, for instance density-dependent,
   and best represented by reaction norms, the evolution of
   density-dependent movement during range expansions has received little
   experimental attention. We therefore tested current theory predicting
   the evolution of increased movement at low densities at range margins
   using highly replicated and controlled range expansion experiments
   across multiple genotypes of the protist model system Tetrahymena
   thermophila. Although rare, we found evolutionary changes during range
   expansions even in the absence of initial standing genetic variation.
   Range expansions led to the evolution of negatively density-dependent
   movement at range margins. In addition, we report the evolution of
   increased intrastrain competitive ability and concurrently decreased
   population growth rates in range cores. Our findings highlight the
   importance of understanding movement and dispersal as evolving reaction
   norms and plastic life-history traits of central relevance for range
   expansions, biological invasions and the dynamics of spatially
   structured systems in general.}},

Abstract = {{Angiostronglyus vasorum is a cardiopulmonary nematode infecting mainly
   canids such as dogs (Canis familiaris) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes).
   Natural infections have also been reported in mustelids and red pandas
   (Ailurus fulgens fulgens). We report the occurrence of natural A.
   vasorum infections in a group of captive meerkats (Suricata suricatta),
   housed at a university facility in Switzerland. A. vasorum first-stage
   larvae (L1) were initially identified in a pooled faecal sample.
   Individual samples, investigated with the Baermann-Wetzel technique,
   revealed that 41\% (7/17) of the meerkats were infected, with ranges of
   2-125 L1/g faeces. PCR and sequencing of part of the ITS-2 region
   resulted in 100\% identity with A. vasorum. Infected animals did not
   show clinical signs. One meerkat died two days after diagnosis. Upon
   necropsy one adult specimen was recovered; histological examination of
   the lung revealed granulomatous pneumonia caused by A. vasorum larvae
   and eggs as well as intima and media hyperplasia and isolated
   arteriosclerosis of larger lung vessels. However, the cause of death was
   a spleen rupture with associated blood loss. All meerkats were topically
   treated with 10 mg imidacloprid/2.5 mg moxidectin per animal, after
   which they became negative in all follow up faecal examinations.
   Potential intermediate (gastropods) and paratenic hosts (birds) were
   collected from within or outside the meerkats enclosure. Gastropods were
   examined by PCR and bird samples by digestion. Four out of 193 (2.1\%)
   gastropod samples were positive for A. vasorum, whereas none of the bird
   samples were positive. Meerkats, belonging to the Herpestidae, therefore
   are suitable definitive hosts for A. vasorum, with production and
   excretion of live L1. Meerkats kept in captivity in areas where A.
   vasorum is endemic and with potential contact to intermediate hosts are
   at risk of infection. Regular faecal examinations including
   Baermann-Wetzel technique should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of female preference for male genetic quality remains a
   controversial topic in sexual selection research. One well-known
   problem, known as the lek paradox, lies in understanding how variation
   in genetic quality is maintained in spite of natural selection and
   sexual selection against low-quality alleles. Here, we theoretically
   investigate a scenario where females pay a direct fitness cost to avoid
   males carrying an autosomal segregation distorter. We show that
   preference evolution is greatly facilitated under such circumstances.
   Because the distorter is transmitted in a non-Mendelian fashion, it can
   be maintained in the population despite directional sexual selection.
   The preference helps females avoid fitness costs associated with the
   distorter. Interestingly, we find that preference evolution is limited
   if the choice allele induces a very strong preference or if distortion
   is very strong. Moreover, the preference can only persist in the
   presence of a signal that reliably indicates a male's distorter
   genotype. Hence, even in a system where the lek paradox does not play a
   major role, costly preferences can only spread under specific
   circumstances. We discuss the importance of distorter systems for the
   evolution of costly female choice and potential implications for the use
   of artificial distorters in pest control.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial amounts of nutrients are lost from soils through leaching.
   These losses can be environmentally damaging, causing groundwater
   eutrophication and also comprise an economic burden in terms of lost
   agricultural production. More intense precipitation events caused by
   climate change will likely aggravate this problem. So far it is
   unresolved to which extent soil biota can make ecosystems more resilient
   to climate change and reduce nutrient leaching losses when rainfall
   intensity increases. In this study, we focused on arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (AM) fungi, common soil fungi that form symbiotic associations with most
   land plants and which increase plant nutrient uptake. We hypothesized
   that AM fungi mitigate nutrient losses following intensive precipitation
   events (higher amount of precipitation and rain events frequency). To
   test this, we manipulated the presence of AM fungi in model grassland
   communities subjected to two rainfall scenarios: moderate and high
   rainfall intensity. The total amount of nutrients lost through leaching
   increased substantially with higher rainfall intensity. The presence of
   AM fungi reduced phosphorus losses by 50\% under both rainfall scenarios
   and nitrogen losses by 40\% under high rainfall intensity. Thus, the
   presence of AM fungi enhanced the nutrient interception ability of
   soils, and AM fungi reduced the nutrient leaching risk when rainfall
   intensity increases. These findings are especially relevant in areas
   with high rainfall intensity (e.g., such as the tropics) and for
   ecosystems that will experience increased rainfall due to climate
   change. Overall, this work demonstrates that soil biota such as AM fungi
   can enhance ecosystem resilience and reduce the negative impact of
   increased precipitation on nutrient losses.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is often used to monitor landslides and
   other gravitational mass movements with high levels of geometric detail
   and accuracy. However, unstructured TLS point clouds lack semantic
   information, which is required to geomorphologically interpret the
   measured changes. Extracting meaningful objects in a complex and dynamic
   environment is challenging due to the objects' fuzziness in reality, as
   well as the variability and ambiguity of their patterns in a
   morphometric feature space. This work presents a point-cloud-based
   approach for classifying multitemporal scenes of a hillslope affected by
   shallow landslides. The 3D point clouds are segmented into
   morphologically homogeneous and spatially connected parts. These
   segments are classified into seven target classes (scarp, eroded area,
   deposit, rock outcrop and different classes of vegetation) in a two-step
   procedure: a supervised classification step with a machine-learning
   classifier using morphometric features, followed by a correction step
   based on topological rules. This improves the final object extraction
   considerably.

   changements mesures. L'extraction d'objets significatifs dans un
   environnement complexe et dynamique constitue un defi en raison du
   manque de nettete des objets dans le monde reel, ainsi que de la
   variabilite et de l'ambiguite de leur representation dans un espace
   morphometrique. Ce travail presente une approche basee sur les nuages de
   points pour la classification de scenes multitemporelles sur un versant
   affecte par des glissements de surface. Les nuages de points 3D sont
   segmentes en parties morphologiquement homogenes et spatialement
   connectees. Les segments sont classifies en sept classes de cibles
   (escarpement, surface erodee, depot, affleurement rocheux et differentes
   classes de vegetation) selon une procedure a deux etapes: une etape de
   classification supervisee par apprentissage automatique utilisant des
   caracteristiques morphometriques, suivie d'une etape de correction basee
   sur des regles topologiques. L'extraction finale d'objets s'en trouve
   considerablement alelioree.
   Zusammenfassung Terrestrisches Laserscanning (TLS) wird haufig fur ein
   geometrisch hochgenaues und detailliertes Monitoring von Rutschungen und
   anderen gravitativen Massenbewegungen verwendet. Die unstrukturierten
   TLS Punktwolken enthalten allerdings nicht die semantische Information,
   die fur die geomorphologische Interpretation von gemessenen Anderungen
   benotigt wird. Schwierigkeiten bei der Extraktion von sinnhaften
   Objekten in einer komplexen und veranderlichen Umgebung ergeben sich
   durch die Unscharfe der Objekte in der Realitat sowie durch ihre teils
   mehrdeutigen Muster in einem morphometrischen Merkmalsraum. In diesem
   Artikel wird ein punktwolken-basierter Ansatz zur Klassifizierung
   multi-temporaler Szenen vorgestellt. Die Szenen bilden einen von
   flachgrundigen Rutschungen betroffenen Hang ab. Die 3D Punktwolken
   werden in morphologisch homogene, raumlich zusammenhangende Bereiche
   segmentiert. Diese Segmente werden in einem zweistufigen Verfahren
   sieben Zielklassen (Anrisskante, Abtragsflache, Ablagerungsbereich,
   Felswand sowie verschiedene Vegetationsklassen) zugeordnet: auf eine
   uberwachte Klassifizierung anhand morphometrischer Merkmale folgt eine
   Korrektur mittels topologischer Regeln. Diese Korrektur verbessert die
   abschlie ss ende Objektextraktion deutlich.
   Resumen El escaneo laser terrestre (TLS) se usa a menudo para monitorear
   deslizamientos de tierra y otros movimientos de masa gravitacional con
   gran detalle geometrico y precision. Sin embargo, las nubes de puntos
   TLS no estructuradas carecen de la informacion semantica que se requiere
   para interpretar geomorfologicamente los cambios medidos. La extraccion
   de objetos en un entorno complejo y dinamico es un reto debido
   ambiguedad de los objetos, a la variabilidad y ambiguedad de sus
   patrones en un espacio de caracteristicas morfometricas. Este trabajo
   presenta un enfoque basado en la nube de puntos para clasificar escenas
   multi-temporales de una ladera afectada por deslizamientos
   superficiales. Las nubes de puntos 3D se segmentan en partes
   morfologicamente homogeneas y espacialmente conectadas. Estos segmentos
   se clasifican en siete clases objetivo (area escarpada, area erosionada,
   deposito, afloramiento rocoso y diferentes clases de vegetacion) en un
   procedimiento de dos etapas: una etapa de clasificacion supervisada con
   un clasificador de aprendizaje automatico utilizando caracteristicas
   morfometricas, seguida de un paso de correccion basado en reglas
   topologicas. Esto mejora considerablemente la extraccion final del
   objeto.

Abstract = {{This study reappraised traditional knowledge (TK) about palms
   (Arecaceae) by the Chachi indigenous group in northwestern Ecuador, 30
   years after the first study in 1985 on Chachi palm ethnobotany (Barfod
   and Balslev 1988). We wished to gain insight about which palm species
   the Chachi people use today, and how palm TK has changed among the
   Chachi since 1985. In 2015, using semi-structured interviews and
   participant observation, we documented nine useful palm species and 457
   use reports. The 1985 methods were less formalized, based on open-ended
   interviews and recorded 14 palm species with 38 use descriptions. Most
   uses fell into the categories Food (13 use descriptions), Utensils/Tools
   (10), and Construction (7). In 2015, most of the use descriptions
   similarly fall into the categories Food (38), Construction (20), and
   Utensils and tools (19). As in 1985, the most important species
   harvested today are Iriartea deltoidea and Wettinia quinaria. Four
   understory palm species reported as useful in 1985 were not recorded in
   2015. Still, most of the uses documented among the Chachi in 1985 were
   also registered in 2015. Knowledge about blowguns, blowgun darts, and
   marimba keys, however, seems to have vanished. Although palms still
   provide important ecosystem services for the Chachi, (e.g., food and
   construction), better management of natural resources and land-use is
   pivotal to meet the Sustainable Development Goals that Ecuador is
   committed to through their participation in the United Nation's
   Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform. This is particularly
   complicated because of the rapid human population growth in the coastal
   lowland of Ecuador and the impending threats from climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Group living promotes opportunities for both cooperation and
   competition. Selection on the ability to cope with such opposing social
   opportunities has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of
   large brains in primates and other social species. However, we still
   know little about the degree of complexity involved in such social
   strategies. Here, we report advanced social strategies in wild vervet
   monkeys. Building on recent experimental evidence that subordinate
   females trade grooming for tolerance from higher-ranking individuals
   during foraging activities, we show that the audience composition
   strongly affects this trade. First, tolerance was lower if the audience
   contained individuals that outranked the subordinate partner,
   independently of audience size and kinship relationships. Second, we
   found a significant interaction between previous grooming and relative
   rank of bystanders: dominant subjects valued recent grooming by
   subordinates while intermediate ranked subjects valued the option to
   aggress subordinate partners in the presence of a dominant audience.
   Aggressors were also more likely to emit coalition recruitment calls if
   the audience contained individuals that outranked the subordinate
   partner. In conclusion, vervet monkeys include both recent grooming and
   knowledge about third-party relationships to make complex decisions when
   trading grooming for tolerance, leading to a finely balanced trade-off
   between reciprocation and opportunities to reinforce rank relationships.}},

   seropositive, indicating past exposure. Overall, the seroprevalence was
   19.27\% (95\% CI 14.9-24.5\%). Pomona seroprevalence was highest with
   9.45\% (6.4-13.7\%), followed by Kenya 5.09\% (2.9-8.6\%), Nigeria

Abstract = {{Freshwater aquatic plants have increased extinction risks due to strong
   human pressure and the patchy nature of their habitats. However, their
   unclear population structure frequently hinders conservation planning.
   To investigate population subdivision and risks to long-term survival of
   such species, we combined genetic, morphometric and biogeographical
   approaches to the example of the endangered water chestnut Trapa natans
   (Lythraceae) from the southern Alpine lake area (Insubria). Amplified
   fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) of seven extant local stands
   revealed similar and intermediate levels of genetic diversity, of which
   c. 97\% was partitioned within lakes. Thus, no signs of strong genetic
   drift and associated loss of genetic diversity were found, despite a
   reduction of c. 52\% of local populations since the early 19th century.
   Nuclear ribosomal sequences (ITS1-5.8S rRNA-ITS2) combined with a
   morphometric study of nuts (based on fresh and historical museum
   material) revealed the presence of two genetically and morphologically
   slightly distinct lineages, one of which went extinct during the 20th
   century after a prolonged period of hyper-eutrophication. Taken
   together, our results indicate the current presence of one large
   Insubric Trapa population. To prevent genetic risks to survival
   associated with small population size and increasing fragmentation due
   to past extinctions, freshwater managers should preserve the large
   census sizes still present in many Insubric lakes and reduce
   eutrophication.}},

Abstract = {{Shifts of center wavelengths (CWLs) and related changes of full-widths
   at half-maximums (FWHMs) occur during in-flight data acquisitions of
   push-broom imaging spectrometers such as the airborne prism experiment
   (APEX). Combined with the spectrally changing properties of the dichroic
   coating that acts as a beam splitter between the visible and near
   infrared (VNIR) as well as the short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels,
   these shifts affect both the spectral and radiometric accuracies of the
   spectrometer data, and hence the accuracy of higher level products. In
   this paper, two independent standards, i.e., atmospheric absorption
   features as well as features of the standard reference material filter
   built in the APEX in-flight characterization facility, are used in a
   complementary way to improve in-flight spectral calibration. The CWL
   shift and FWHM change for each detector element are simultaneously
   detected by using spectrum-matching and surface fitting techniques under
   constraints from pregenerated shift realizations. Subsequently, the APEX
   spectroradiometric response model is improved in the aspect of spectral
   resolution by using performance parameters of optics and detector
   modules. The radiometric gain and offset for each detector element are
   corrected according to the detected CWLs and FWHMs, as well as the
   improved APEX response model. Compared with the spectral and radiometric
   parameters acquired during laboratory calibration, the detected CWLs and
   FWHMs promote the accuracy of the atmospheric feature positions in the
   SWIR channel by 10 nm, whereas the corrected gains and offsets reduce
   the radiance deviation in the spectral regions 375-550 nm and 950-1080
   nm both by 70\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation activity may be changed in response to climate variability by
   affecting seasonality and phenological events. Monitoring of land
   surface phenological changes play a key role in understanding feedback
   of ecosystem dynamics. This study focuses on the analysis of trends in
   land surface phenology derived parameters using normalized difference
   vegetation index time series based on Global Inventory Monitoring and
   Mapping Studies data in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran covering the
   period 1981-2012. First, we applied interpolation for data
   reconstruction in order to remove outliers and cloud contamination in
   time series. Phenological parameters were retrieved by using the
   midpoint approach, whereas trends were estimated using the Theil-Sen
   approach. Correlation coefficients were evaluated from multiple linear
   regression between phenological parameters against temperature and
   precipitation time series. Significant Mann-Kendall test analysis
   indicate average start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) increased
   by -0.16 and +0.14 days per year, respectively. Results of significant
   trend analysis showed that later EOS was associated with increasing
   temperature trends and we found strongest relationships between
   temperature and phenological parameters in the west of the Hyrcanian
   forests, where precipitation was abundant. Moreover, SOS correlated
   strongly with total precipitation and mean temperature. This study
   allows us to better estimate the drivers affecting the vegetation
   dynamics in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran.}},

Abstract = {{The high tree diversity of subtropical forests is linked to the
   biodiversity of other trophic levels. Disentangling the effects of tree
   species richness and composition, forest age, and stand structure on
   higher trophic levels in a forest landscape is important for
   understanding the factors that promote biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning. Using a plot network spanning gradients of tree diversity
   and secondary succession in subtropical forest, we tested the effects of
   tree community characteristics (species richness and composition) and
   forest succession (stand age) on arthropod community characteristics
   (morphotype diversity, abundance and composition) of four arthropod
   functional groups. We posit that these gradients differentially affect
   the arthropod functional groups, which mediates the diversity,
   composition, and abundance of arthropods in subtropical forests. We
   found that herbivore richness was positively related to tree species
   richness. Furthermore, the composition of herbivore communities was
   associated with tree species composition. In contrast, detritivore
   richness and composition was associated with stand age instead of tree
   diversity. Predator and pollinator richness and abundance were not
   strongly related to either gradient, although positive trends with tree
   species richness were found for predators. The weaker effect of tree
   diversity on predators suggests a cascading diversity effect from trees
   to herbivores to predators. Our results suggest that arthropod diversity
   in a subtropical forest reflects the net outcome of complex interactions
   among variables associated with tree diversity and stand age. Despite
   this complexity, there are clear linkages between the overall richness
   and composition of tree and arthropod communities, in particular
   herbivores, demonstrating that these trophic levels directly impact each
   other.}},

Abstract = {{Faecal indices are used to describe spatiotemporal patterns of diet
   quality in wild herbivores, and near infrared spectroscopy methods
   (NIRS) distinctively reduce costs and labour compared to conventional
   chemical analyses. In this study we compared the prediction accuracy of
   faecal nitrogen (N), ash and fibrous fractions of a laboratory
   instrument (NIRS) with that of a lightweight portable instrument
   (VisNIRS) using faecal samples of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). We then
   compared how different indices based on faecal N and fibrous fractions
   were able to detect the expected temporal trend and difference between
   sexes in diet quality, and verified whether the presumably lower
   accuracy of NIRS and VisNIRS (compared to wet chemistry) influenced the
   ability of indices to detect such trends. The laboratory NIRS was more
   accurate than the portable VisNIRS, especially for fibrous fractions.
   Predicted data from both instruments clearly identified the temporal
   trend identified by chemically analysed data, but only NIRS identified
   the small difference between sexes. Expressing faecal N as a proportion
   of organic matter (OM) or neutral detergent fibre (NDF) improved the
   power of the index as compared to expressing it as a proportion of dry
   matter (DM), irrespective of the method used to estimate the data.
   Faecal NDF contents followed the patterns expected from the variation of
   faecal N, while faecal acid detergent fibre (ADF) and especially lignin
   (ADL) followed contradictory patterns, which might be due to a selection
   of different forage sources rather than to changing quality of a
   homogenous forage source. We conclude that expressing faecal N as a
   proportion of OM is advised with wild herbivores faeces, where ash
   content can be biased by accidental soil contamination or ingestion.
   Faecal fibrous fractions are useful to complement faecal N and to avoid
   simplified interpretations of the results. For this purpose, NIRS
   methods can be extremely useful to predict multiple indices on large
   numbers of samples. VisNIRS portable instruments might be unable to
   detect subtle biological patterns in small numbers of samples. However,
   developing procedures for portable instruments outside laboratory
   facilities might further improve practicability, cost effectiveness,
   and, through allowing on field predictions on large numbers of samples,
   power of statistical testing of diet quality indices.}},

Abstract = {{Many species approach predators to harass and drive them away, even
   though mobbing a predator can be deadly. However, not all species
   display this behavior, and those that do can exhibit different behaviors
   while mobbing different predators. Here we experimentally assessed the
   role of social and ecological traits on the expression of mobbing
   behavior in a bird community in SE Brazil (n = 157 species). We exposed
   birds to models of two morphologically similar diurnal owls that pose
   different risks, and assessed which species engaged in mobbing. Among
   those that mobbed, we evaluated how they adjusted their mobbing behavior
   depending on the predator type. We tested the hypothesis that only
   species that are at risk and can afford to mob engage in this
   antipredator behavior. We found that species that engaged in mobbing are
   in the body mass range of potential prey, forage in the understory or in
   the canopy, and form flocks. A species' social system did not influence
   its mobbing behavior. Furthermore, species that engaged in mobbing
   formed larger mobbing assemblages when facing a high-risk predator, but
   mobbed more intensely when facing a low-risk predator. Our findings
   support our predictions, namely that the expression of mobbing is
   limited by its costs.}},

Abstract = {{Tundra shrubs are slow-growing species limited by low air temperature
   and scarce nutrient availability. However, shrub expansion has been
   widely observed in the Arctic during the last decades and attributed to
   climate warming. Shift in shrub growth, wood structure and abundance
   affects the surface albedo and permafrost thawing and these changes may
   feedback to climate. Despite the importance of shrub-climate feedbacks,
   uncertainties about shrub growth sensitivity to climate remain. Here, we
   explored the indirect effects of climate warming on shrub growth
   (vertical and radial), bark thickness, and bark investment in four
   arctic shrub species. We combined a field experiment addressing two
   suggested growth drivers - thawing depth and nutrient availability -
   with dendroecology in a Siberian tundra ecosystem. We used heating
   cables to increase the thawing depth. To enhance the nutrient
   availability, we fertilized the surface soil layers. We found that shrub
   growth was mainly limited by nutrient availability, as indicated by the
   fertilization treatment effects on shrub growth ring widths. We also
   found a bark thickness decrease with the combined soil heating and
   nutrient addition treatment and a negative correlation between bark
   investment and growth rate for two of the species. These findings
   suggest that tundra shrubs, especially deciduous species, will grow
   faster and taller driven by an increasing nutrient availability in the
   surface soil layers. However, shrubs might become more vulnerable to
   pests, herbivory, and climate extremes, such as frost or drought events,
   due to thinner bark and lower bark investment. Using dendroecological
   approaches in field experiments simulating projected climate scenarios
   for the Arctic, and an increasing number of study species and locations
   will reduce uncertainties related to shrub growth sensitivity to climate
   and other processes driving shrub dynamics.}},

   a Small Detention Pond}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Detention ponds constructed in urban areas should perform two major
   functions: reduce flood flows and improve quality of runoff by trapping
   sediments and related pollutants. Providing tools for an efficient and
   low data-demanding assessment of pond performance can greatly support
   sediment management at the small catchment scale. This paper adopts the
   approach of a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) to model the
   sediment concentration in the stormwater outflow from a small detention
   pond located in an urbanized catchment. The model is developed and
   tested using data sets of seven rainfall-runoff-suspended sediment
   events. Good agreement between observed and estimated outflow from the
   pond is achieved for both hydrographs and sediment graphs in calibration
   and validation. Thus results indicate that the present model due to its
   low data demand can predict sediment graphs at the outlet from such
   low-volume reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{Containment of genetically modified (GM) microorganisms such as
   Escherichia coli is a legal requirement to protect the environment from
   an unintended release and to avoid horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of
   recombinant DNA to native bacteria. In this study, we sampled the
   laboratory wastewater (LWW) at a large Swiss university from three
   sources over 2 years and cultured ampicillin-resistant, presumptive GM
   E. coli. From a total of 285 samples, 127 contained presumptive GM E.
   coli (45\%) at a mean concentration of 2.8 x 10(2) CFU/ml. Plasmid DNA
   of 11 unique clones was partially or entirely sequenced. All consisted
   of cloning vectors harboring research-specific inserts. To estimate the
   chance of HGT between GM E. coli and native bacteria in LWW, we
   identified taxa representative for the bacterial community in LWW using
   16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and measured conjugation frequencies of E.
   coli with five LWW isolates. At optimal conjugation conditions,
   frequencies were between 3.4 x 10(-3) and 2.4 x 10(-5). Given the
   absence of transferable broad-host range plasmids and suboptimal
   conjugation conditions in the LWW system, we conclude that the chance of
   HGT is relatively low. Still, this study shows that the implementation
   of robust containment measures is key to avoid the escape of GM
   microorganisms.}},

Title = {{Vascular plant diversity structures bryophyte colonization in
   experimental grassland}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{903-914}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{QuestionsNumerous grassland biodiversity experiments have explored how
   plant diversity influences colonization by vascular plants, but no such
   studies have examined how sown vascular plant diversity structures
   colonization by bryophytes, which can contribute greatly to grassland
   diversity.
   LocationGrassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment), Germany.
   MethodsWe studied bryophyte composition in experimental grasslands
   encompassing a gradient of vascular plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8,
   16 and 60 species), functional group richness and composition (one to
   four; grasses, legumes, tall herbs, small herbs) as well as in
   additional bare ground and spontaneously colonized plots and
   semi-natural control meadows.
   ResultsIncreasing vascular plant species richness and functional group
   richness as well as the presence of legume species decreased bryophyte
   species richness and increased the spatial variability of this richness.
   Bryophyte species richness and cover responded positively to grass
   presence, which also decreased the spatial variability of both. The
   proportion of acrocarpous species was largest in bare ground plots and
   decreased with increasing vascular plant species richness and with grass
   and legume presence. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed that
   bryophyte species composition followed the gradient in sown vascular
   plant species richness and was dependent on grass and legume presence.
   The effect of plant diversity on bryophytes was only partly attributable
   to increased vascular plant species cover. Bryophyte habitat indicator
   values suggested that conditions in communities of higher vascular plant
   diversity that included grasses were more shady, moist and nutrient-rich
   than in communities with lower vascular plant diversity and without
   grasses, whereas bryophyte assemblages in communities with legumes
   indicated well-lit nutrient-rich conditions. Even after 6yr, bryophyte
   species richness and cover was considerably lower in experimental
   grasslands than in semi-natural meadows, suggesting a role for dispersal
   limitation or habitat filtering.
   ConclusionsOur study shows that bryophyte colonization is not random,
   rather it is structured by vascular plant species diversity and
   composition. Not all components of a plant community respond positively
   to increased vascular plant diversity and advocating increased richness
   of one taxonomic group over another in grassland may reduce net species
   diversity.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Anthropogenic pressures on the global biome are causing widespread
   species declines and extinctions. Assessing the extinction risk faced by
   individual species is a critical first step in combating this trend.
   However, we lack high quality demographic data to do so for the vast
   majority of plant and animal species. We present an efficient modeling
   approach to estimate extinction risk based on a statistical framework
   from the mark-recapture literature. We assessed the model's performance
   using a combination of simulated data, results from a protist microcosm
   experiment, and data from a long-term, large-scale habitat fragmentation
   experiment in southeastern Australia. Simulation experiments showed the
   model is robust to missing data as well as biological processes not
   included explicitly in the model's assumptions. Fitting the model to
   data from the protist experiment yielded accurate predictions of the
   regional extinction dynamics observed in the system, even with a
   relatively low level of replication. Finally, the model was able to
   accurately predict the observed dynamics in the habitat fragmentation
   experiment. The model provides a robust and accurate method to evaluate
   a species' extinction risk. Since it only requires presence/absence
   data, applies to a wide range of survey designs, and allows for
   observational uncertainty and missing data, it can be applied to many
   datasets that existing models cannot accommodate. For these reasons, the
   model should be useful in conservation settings.}},

Abstract = {{The time scales of pathogen evolution are of major concern in the
   context of public and veterinary health, epidemiology and evolutionary
   biology. Dating the emergence of a pathogen often relies on estimates of
   evolutionary rates derived from nucleotide sequence data. For many
   viruses, this has yielded estimates of evolutionary origins only a few
   hundred years in the past. Here we demonstrate through the incorporation
   of geographical information from virus sampling that evolutionary age
   estimates of two European hantaviruses are severely underestimated
   because of pervasive mutational saturation of nucleotide sequences. We
   detected very strong relationships between spatial distance and genetic
   divergence for both Puumala and Tula hantavirus-irrespective of whether
   nucleotide or derived amino acid sequences were analysed. Extrapolations
   from these relationships dated the emergence of these viruses most
   conservatively to at least 3700 and 2500 years ago, respectively. Our
   minimum estimates for the age of these hantaviruses are ten to a hundred
   times older than results from current non-spatial methods, and in much
   better accordance with the biogeography of these viruses and their
   respective hosts. Spatial information can thus provide valuable insights
   on the deeper time scales of pathogen evolution and improve our
   understanding of disease emergence.}},

Abstract = {{We studied differentiation and geneflow patterns between enantiomorphic
   door-snail species in two hybrid zones in the Bucegi Mountains (Romania)
   to investigate the effects of intrinsic barriers (complications in
   copulation) and extrinsic selection by environmental factors. A
   mitochondrial gene tree confirmed the historical separation of the
   examined populations into the dextral Alopia livida and the sinistral
   Alopia straminicollis in accordance with the morphological
   classification, but also indicated gene flow between the species. By
   contrast, a network based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms
   (AFLP) markers revealed local groups of populations as units independent
   of their species affiliation. Admixture analyses based on AFLP data
   showed that the genomes of most individuals in the hybrid zones are
   composed of parts of the genomes of both parental taxa. The
   introgression patterns of a notable fraction of the examined markers
   deviated from neutral introgression. However, the patterns of most
   non-neutral markers were not concordant between the two hybrid zones.
   There was also no concordance between non-neutral markers in the two
   genomic clines and markers that were correlated with environmental
   variables or markers that were correlated with the proportion of dextral
   individuals in the populations. Neither extrinsic selection by
   environmental factors nor intrinsic barriers resulting from positive
   frequency-dependent selection of the prevailing coiling direction were
   sufficient to maintain the distinctness of A. straminicollis and A.
   livida. Despite being historically separated units, we conclude that
   these taxa now merge where they come into contact.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the worldwide unprecedented bunker infrastructure of
   Switzerland. Since the 1960s, the country has built hundreds of
   thousands of nuclear bomb shelters in family homes. Drawing on
   poststructural theories of social practice and ritual theory, the
   all-pervasive structures in the private sphere are analyzed as
   transitory spaces that coordinate the movement and connections between
   different milieus, regimes, and bodies. By studying the operational
   scripts of the authorities and the spatial arrangements and artifacts of
   the shelter, the paper argues that a sequenced set of ``rites of
   passage{''} were to be practiced in order to guarantee a transition into
   the postapocalypse without any violations of norms, social roles, and
   affective regimes. However, this ``territorializing{''} process launched
   by the state with the aim of engineering a ``bomb-proof{''} society met
   with little success. By ignoring, distorting, or violating the constant
   prewar situation in their homes, Swiss people, as early as in the 1970s,
   started to undermine the shelter as an instance of concrete
   governmentality. Being traversed by various processes of
   ``deterritorialization{''} the bunker lost its function as a locus of
   secured passage and transformed into a highly dynamic ``empty space{''}
   that hides, till this day, residua for creativity and difference.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{163-181}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Human activities affect both tree species composition and diversity in
   forested ecosystems. This in turn alters the species diversity of plant
   litter and litter quality, which may have cascading effects on soil
   microbial communities and their functions for decomposition and nutrient
   cycling. We tested microbial responses to litter species diversity in a
   leaf litter decomposition experiment including monocultures, 2-, and
   4-species mixtures in the subtropical climate zone of southeastern
   China. Soil microbial community composition was assessed by lipid
   analysis, and microbial functions were measured using extracellular
   enzyme activity and gross rates of nitrogen mineralization. We observed
   a positive relationship between litter species diversity and abundances
   of mycorrhizal fungi and actinomycetes. Alternatively, enzyme activities
   involved in carbon and phosphorus acquisition, and enzyme indices of
   relative carbon limitation, were higher only in the 4-species mixtures.
   This suggests that the minimum basal substrate level for enzyme
   production was reached, or that limitation was higher, at the highest
   diversity level only. Responses to litter diversity also changed over
   time, where phosphatase responses to litter diversity were strongest
   early in decomposition and the indices of carbon limitation relative to
   other nutrients showed stronger responses later in decomposition. Enzyme
   activities were related to lipid biomarker data and the mass of litter
   remaining at the third time point, but relationships between enzyme
   activity and the mass of litter remaining were not consistent across
   other time points. We conclude that litter species richness will likely
   only reduce microbial functions at key intervals of diversity loss while
   microbial growth is more sensitive to incremental diversity loss, with
   no clear relationships between them or to ecosystem functions. The
   observed litter diversity effects on soil microbial biomass and enzyme
   activity indicate interactions of aboveground and belowground
   communities, and together with environmental conditions they are
   important for maintaining ecosystem functions.}},

Abstract = {{Clusia shows high infrageneric and sometimes infraspecific diversity in
   growth form, floral morphology and pollination biology. Species offering
   floral resin as a reward to pollinating bees often show unique
   androecial structures. We investigate the stamen structure of two groups
   of Clusia with resin flowers and anthers with numerous locelli: all the
   species of section Polythecandra and Clusia nigrolineata (Clusia section
   Cordylandra). In section Polythecandra the flowers have stamens with a
   short, thick filaments and anthers with numerous locelli
   (microsporangia) without thecal organization. When bees try to remove
   resin, in most species the whole anther detaches from the rest of the
   stamen and then dehisces in the detachment zone in areas where the cells
   have thinner cell walls, a unique mechanism. Stamens of C. nigrolineata
   also have numerous locelli and a broad and short filament, but pairs of
   locelli are disposed in two parallel series and the anthers show a clear
   thecal organization. We discuss the stamen characters in relation to the
   floral biology of the species and suggest that the athecal
   multilocellate anthers of section Polythecandra evolved to minimize
   contact of pollen with the sticky floral resin. The locellate anthers of
   C. nigrolineata, on the other hand, offer a resin-pollen mixture to
   flower visitors in the same way as other species of section Cordylandra
   with normal anthers. In this case, locelli might have evolved to cope up
   with the enlargement of the anthers compared to other species of the
   section. The difference in the organization of the anthers of C.
   nigrolineata and the species of section Polythecandra indicate that
   multilocellate anthers have evolved independently in these groups.}},

Abstract = {{This paper assesses the vulnerability of Arctic fishing communities. We
   hypothesise that climate change related trends, such as increasing
   temperature and altered seasonality, and shocks, such as the breakdown
   of the Soviet Union or new fishing regulations, increase vulnerability
   of local Arctic peoples and compromise the sustainability of their
   livelihoods. Research shows that over recent decades local people have
   observed environmental changes and a significant decrease in the number
   of fish caught. Fishing regulations introduced after the collapse of the
   Soviet Union burdened fishers with quotas and temporal limitations that
   have hindered their fishing activities. While the adaptability of
   traditional fishing techniques to seasonally changing conditions might
   indicate the potential to adapt to future conditions under climate
   change, fishing regulations appear to limit this potential to adapt.}},

Abstract = {{Asexual reproduction is widespread in land plants, including ferns where
   10\% of all species are obligate asexuals. In these ferns, apogamous
   sporophytes are generated directly from gametophytes, bypassing
   fertilization. In the model fern Ceratopteris richardii, a sexual
   species, apogamy can be induced by culture on high sugar media. BABY
   BOOM (BBM) genes in angiosperms are known to promote somatic
   embryogenesis, which like apogamy produce sporophytes without
   fertilization. Here, a Brassica napus BBM (BnBBM) was used to
   investigate genetic similarity between apogamy in ferns and somatic
   embryogenesis in angiosperms. A C.richardii transcriptome was
   constructed from which one AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE unigene, CrANT, was
   identified. Whole mount insitu hybridization showed that CrANT is
   expressed in sperm and fertilized eggs. Phylogenetic analysis grouped
   CrANT with other non-seed-plant ANT genes to the euANT clade but in a
   branch separate from BBM genes. Overexpression of CrANT or BnBBM
   promotes apogamy in C.richardii without sugar supplement. CrANT
   knockdown gametophytes responded weakly to sugar for apogamy promotion.
   Theses results suggest some genetic conservation between apogamy and
   somatic embryogenesis and that such asexual reproduction may be ancient.
   Significance Statement Asexual reproduction is widespread in land
   plants; somatic embryogenesis can form new sporophytes, and many
   non-seed plants, especially ferns, develop sporophytes directly from
   gametophytes without fertilization, through a process called apogamy.
   Here we uncover a genetic similarity between somatic embryogenesis and
   apogamy, by showing that apogamy in a model fern is promoted by
   expression of an angiosperm gene that promotes somatic embryogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are focused via range and azimuth
   compression. Typically, a matched filter is used for range compression.
   However, its inherent operation introduces target masking due to
   sidelobes, reducing the recognition and interpretability of the
   underlying targets. To optimize the focusing quality, adaptive pulse
   compression (APC) can be applied. In this paper, APC is assessed for
   range processing in SAR image focusing. The performance of the method is
   evaluated with airborne SAR imagery and compared with those of
   traditional schemes. We show that by applying APC under single-channel
   interferometric and stepped frequency scenarios, the quality of the SAR
   images, the corresponding phase maps, and interferometric coherence
   images can be significantly improved, and that APC provides both better
   amplitude and phase estimates of the range profiles. APC is shown to
   preserve the characteristics of the azimuth signals and can be applied
   without restricting the azimuth compression scheme.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to the domestic horse, whose digestive physiology has been
   thoroughly investigated, knowledge on the digestive physiology of wild
   equids is scarce. Comparisons between the domestic horse and the
   domestic donkey suggest that wild asses might achieve higher
   digestibilities. This could derive from longer retention times or a
   greater difference in the mean retention time (MRT) of particles vs.
   fluid (the selectivity factor (SF)). Here, we measured MRT of a solute
   (fluid; MRTsolute) and a particle (<2 mm; MRTparticle) marker in five
   captive male Somali wild asses (Equus africanus somaliensis) fed a diet
   of 95\% grass hay. At a mean dry matter intake of 94 +/- 3 g kg(-0.75)
   day(-1), MRTsolute was 33.3 +/- 5.4 h and MRTparticle 39.6 +/- 3.9 h,
   resulting in a SF of 1.21 +/- 0.14. For their food intake, Somali wild
   asses appeared to have slightly higher MRTparticle than expected based
   on domestic equid data, in contrast to Grevy zebras (Equus grevyi),
   potentially indicating higher capacities of the digestive tract.
   However, considering data on domestic horses, donkeys, and zebra, there
   was no evident difference in the SF of wild equids compared to domestic
   ones. Together with an absence of reported anatomical differences in the
   digestive tract of wild and domestic equids, the data suggest a general
   similarity in the digestive physiology of equid species that contrasts
   with the diversity in the digestive physiology of ruminants, and that
   might be one contributing factor to a lack of sympatric,
   niche-differentiated equid species.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about genome size (GS) variation in the hyperdiverse
   Cape flora of southern Africa. Towards filling this gap, we measured GS
   of 158 species of Cape Restionaceae and demonstrated > 16-fold variation
   in 1C-values (0.47-7.66 pg). We also report chromosome counts of nine
   species and show that 2n = 32 predominates. Patterns of GS variation
   were used to infer ploidy, and the variation at the holoploid level was
   partitioned into monoploid and ploidy variation. We show that at least
   30\% of the species measured contain several ploidies. The monoploid GS
   variation was phylogenetically constrained and 1Cx-values were
   significantly lower in areas near the centre of the Cape Floristic
   Region and in species which resprout after fire. A higher proportion of
   inferred polyploids were found in species with wide distribution ranges,
   which are smaller plants, resprout after fires and are therefore longer
   lived. In addition, polyploids prevail in areas at the periphery of the
   Cape Floristic Region, which are more likely to have been exposed to
   fluctuating climates in the past, and at higher elevations. This shows
   that monoploid and polyploid GS variation could be responding to
   different selection pressures.}},

Abstract = {{After centuries of massive decline, the recovery of the wolf (Canis
   lupus italicus) in Italy is a typical conservation success story. To
   learn more about the possible role of parasites in the wolves'
   individual and population health and conservation we used non-invasive
   molecular approaches on fecal samples to identify individual wolves,
   pack membership, and the taeniids present, some of which are zoonotic. A
   total of 130 specimens belonging to 54 wolves from eight packs were
   collected and examined. Taeniid eggs were isolated using a
   sieving/flotation technique, and the species level was identified by PCR
   (gene target: 12S rRNA and nad1). Taeniid prevalence was 40.7\% for
   Taenia hydatigena, 22.2\% for T. krabbei, 1.8\% for T. polyachanta and
   5.5\% for Echinococcus granulosus. The prevalence of E. granulosus is
   discussed. Our results show that the taeniid fauna found in wolves from
   the Foreste Casentinesi National Park is comparable to that described
   for other domestic and wild Italian canids and provides insights into
   the wolves' diet and their relationship with the environment. (C) 2017

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The Digital Revolution is inducing major threats to many types of human
   systems. We present the SVIDT method (a Strengths, Vulnerability, and
   Intervention Assessment related to Digital Threats) for managing the
   vulnerabilities of human systems with respect to digital threats and
   changes. The method first performs a multilevel system-actor analysis
   for assessing vulnerabilities and strengths with respect to digital
   threats. Then, the method identifies threat scenarios that may become
   real. By constructing, evaluating, and launching interventions against
   all identified digital threats and their critical negative outcomes, the
   resilience of a specific human system can be improved. The evaluation of
   interventions is done when strengthening the adaptive capacity, i.e., a
   system's capability to cope with negative outcomes that may take place
   in the future. The SVIDT method is embedded in the framework of coupled
   human-environment systems, the theory of risk and vulnerability
   assessment, types of adaptation (assimilation vs. accommodation), and a
   comprehensive sustainability evaluation. The SVIDT method is exemplarily
   applied to an enterprise (i.e., a Swiss casino) for which online gaming
   has become an essential digital-business field. The discussion reflects
   on the specifics of digital threats and discusses both the potential
   benefits and limitations of the SVIDT method.}},

Abstract = {{Are the hyperdiverse local forests of the western Amazon undergoing
   changes linked to global and local drivers such as climate change, or
   successional dynamics? We analyzed local climatic records to assess
   potential climatic changes in Yasuni National Park, Ecuador, and
   compared two censuses (1995, 2012) of a palm community to assess changes
   in community structure and composition. Over 17 years, the structure and
   composition of this palm community remained remarkably stable. Soil
   humidity was significantly lower and canopy conditions were
   significantly more open in 2012 compared to 1995, but local climatic
   records showed that no significant changes in precipitation, temperature
   or river level have occurred during the last decade. Thus, we found no
   evidence of recent directional shifts in climate or the palm community
   in Yasuni. The absence of changes in local climate and plant community
   dynamics in Yasuni contrasts with recent findings from eastern Amazon,
   where environmental change is driving significant changes in ecosystem
   dynamics. Our findings suggest that until now, local forests in the
   northwest Amazon may have escaped pressure from climate change. The
   stability of this rich palm community embedded in the hyperdiverse
   Yasuni National Park underlines its uniqueness as a sanctuary for the
   protection of Amazonian diversity from global change impacts.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Many prey species mob predators to drive them away, thereby reducing
   their immediate and future predation risk. Given that mobbing is risky,
   it may also serve as an opportunity for males to advertise their
   phenotypic quality to females; however, this idea remains untested. We
   tested this hypothesis with a field experiment in south-eastern Brazil
   that assessed the response of sexually dimorphic bird species to models
   of two diurnal owls: a ferruginous pygmy owl (Glaucidium brasilianum),
   which mainly eats small birds, and a burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia),
   which mainly eats invertebrates and thus poses a low risk to birds.
   Across 19 bird species, the mobbing intensity was higher when facing the
   less-dangerous owl, and more males engaged in predator mobbing than
   females. The mobbing intensity of males was higher with a larger number
   of conspecific females present. This finding indicates that males may
   use mobbing to display their phenotypic quality to females, suggesting
   that predator mobbing may be influenced by sexual selection.}},

Abstract = {{Many host-plants exhibit genetic variation in resistance to pathogens;
   however, little is known about the extent to which genetic variation in
   pathogen resistance influences other members of the host-plant
   community, especially arthropods at higher trophic levels. We addressed
   this knowledge gap by using a common garden experiment to examine
   whether genotypes of Populus trichocarpa varied in resistance to a
   leaf-blistering pathogen, Taphrina sp., and in the density of
   web-building spiders, the dominant group of predatory arthropods. In
   addition, we examined whether variation in spider density was explained
   by variation in the density and size of leaf blisters caused by
   Taphrina. We found that P. trichocarpa genotypes exhibited strong
   differences in their resistance to Taphrina and that P. trichocarpa
   genotypes that were more susceptible to Taphrina supported more
   web-building spiders, the dominant group of predatory arthropods. We
   suspect that this result is caused by blisters increasing the
   availability of suitable habitat for predators, and not due to variation
   in herbivores because including herbivore density as a covariate did not
   affect our models. Our study highlights a novel pathway by which genetic
   variation in pathogen resistance may affect higher trophic levels in
   arthropod communities.}},

Abstract = {{Molluscan benthic assemblages provide unique opportunities for
   understanding both spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity.
   Species richness in the shell remains found at a site (i.e. the death
   assemblage) is typically several times higher than in the counterpart
   living assemblage, reflecting a complex history of settlement,
   dissemination and decomposition post-mortem. We used high-density
   temporal and spatial sampling (>37000 individuals representing 196 taxa)
   of a shallow (5-8 m) nearshore sandy habitat off the coast of south-east
   Sardinia (Italy, Mediterranean Sea) to study the factors responsible for
   differences in the relative diversity of living and death assemblages.
   We found that death assemblages at all sites were considerably more
   diverse than living communities (1.5-3.5x more dead than living taxa
   after sample-size standardization), with 78\% of all taxa solely
   recovered as empty shells, resulting in low live-dead agreement. By
   carefully filtering the raw data and combining them with habitat
   information extracted from the literature, we disentangled the major
   causes of this discordance and quantified their individual effects.
   Increased dead diversities could not be attributed to undersampling of
   the living community, but instead resulted from three phenomena of
   decreasing importance: the postmortem, out-of-habitat transport of
   non-indigenous taxa (57\% of dead-only taxa were allochthonous), the
   time-averaged presence of rare indigenous taxa (40\% of dead-only taxa),
   and the likely local extirpation of a small number of species (3\% of
   dead-only taxa). Our approach demonstrates how ecological inferences
   based on death assemblages can be improved by restricting analyses to
   demonstrably indigenous taxa, and highlights how mollusc shell remains
   can be used to provide information over both ecological and evolutionary
   timescales. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the great importance of cities, relatively little consistent
   information about their internal configuration (structure, cover and
   materials) is available. The World Urban Database and Access Portal
   Tools (WUDAPT) initiative aims at the acquisition, storage and
   dissemination of data on the form and function of cities indifferent
   levels. At the lowest level, the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme
   provides a basic description of urban structure. This scheme is a
   climate-based typology of urban and natural landscapes that also
   provides relevant information on basic physical properties of the
   landscape, which can be used in modelling and observational studies. The
   LCZ scheme has large potential as a standard generic description of
   urban areas. In this paper the scheme and our standard mapping approach
   are presented, followed by recent improvements and research on
   object-based image analysis, transferability of trained LCZ classifiers,
   quality of crowd contributions, and the use of other data sources and
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{It is thought that adaptive changes protect high-altitude populations
   against altitude-induced diseases, but information from well controlled
   studies is lacking. In a prospective, controlled study, we assessed the
   prevalence of acute mountain sickness (AMS) and severity of
   altitude-induced arterial hypoxemia in non-acclimatized Aymara and non-
   Aymara children and adolescents during the first 48h after rapid ascent
   by bus from sea level to 3500masl. To exclude confounding protective
   effects conferred by developmental changes induced by being born or
   living at high altitude, only children and adolescents who were born and
   had been permanently living at sea level were included. In 91 healthy
   non-acclimatized Chilean children and adolescents (37 with Aymara
   high-altitude ancestry, 54 non- Aymaras), we assessed for AMS (Lake
   Louise scoring system) 6, 18 and 42h after a 2.5h ascent by bus to a
   high-altitude research station located at 3500masl. The overall
   prevalence of AMS (Aymaras, 22 of 37, 59\%; non-Aymaras (39 of 54, 72\%;
   p=0.26) and the severity of AMS (Aymaras, mean score 4.7, non-Aymaras,
   mean score 4.6, p=0.72) and altitude-induced arterial hypoxemia (82.9 vs
   82.5\%, p=0.73) were comparable in the two groups. These findings
   provide the first evidence that Andean high-altitude ancestry per se
   does, not decrease significantly the prevalence of AMS and severity of
   altitude-induced arterial hypoxemia in children and adolescents,
   suggesting that in Andean populations evolutionary adaptation itself
   does not confer important protection against these frequent problems.}},

Abstract = {{After almost two decades of violent conflict in eastern Democratic
   Republic of the Congo (DRC) -during which time the Virunga National Park
   was focused mainly on `mere survival' -nature conservation practices in
   the Park began following strategies of re-enclosure in 2003. These
   practices are being contested by local population groups using a variety
   of different strategies. While local and trans-local elites employ more
   overt, explicit forms of (political) contestation, peasants resort to
   `weapons of the weak', engaging in more covert, implicit forms of
   everyday resistance, whereby the customary mode of organising access to
   land works -among other functions-as a vehicle for resistance. This
   paper argues that this multi-dimensional resistance ties in with general
   conflict dynamics in eastern DRC, while at the same time reproducing
   them within the realm of nature conservation, tightly interwoven with

Abstract = {{Illegal wildlife poaching poses one severe threat to the environment.
   Measures to stem poaching have only been with limited success, mainly
   due to efforts required to keep track of wildlife stock and animal
   tracking. Recent developments in remote sensing have led to low-cost
   Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), facilitating quick and repeated image
   acquisitions over vast areas. In parallel, progress in object detection
   in computer vision yielded unprecedented performance improvements,
   partially attributable to algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks
   (CNNs). We present an object detection method tailored to detect large
   animals in UAV images. We achieve a substantial increase in precision
   over a robust state-of-the-art model on a dataset acquired over the
   Kuzikus wildlife reserve park in Namibia. Furthermore, our model
   processes data at over 72 images per second, as opposed 3 for the
   baseline, allowing for real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{Cytokinins are classical plant hormones that control numerous
   developmental processes throughout the plant life cycle.
   Cytokinin-responsive cells activate transcription via a phospho-relay
   signaling network. Type-B nuclear RESPONSE REGULATOR (RR) proteins
   mediate transcriptional activation as the final step in the signaling
   cascade. They bind to promoters of immediate-early target genes via a
   conserved Myb-related DNA-binding domain. To monitor transcriptional
   activation in response to a cytokinin stimulus, we have constructed a
   synthetic promoter, TCS (two-component signaling sensor) that harbors
   the concatemerized binding motifs for activated type-B RR in an
   optimized configuration. Here, we describe our protocols for imaging
   TCSn::GFP expression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. The use of the
   fluorescent reporter GFP allows the visualization of

Abstract = {{Recent advances in fluorescence-based staining of cellular compartments
   coupled with confocal microscopy imaging have allowed the visualization
   of three-dimensional (3D) structures with cellular resolution in various
   intact plant tissues and species. Such approaches are of particular
   interest for the analysis of the reproductive lineage in plants
   including the meiotic precursor cells deeply embedded within the ovary
   of the gynoecium enclosed in the flower. Yet, their relative
   inaccessibility and the lack of optical clarity of plant tissues prevent
   robust staining and imaging across several cell layers. Several
   whole-mount tissue staining and clearing techniques are available. One
   of them specifically allows staining of cellular boundaries in thick
   tissue samples while providing extreme optical clarity, using an acidic
   treatment followed by a modified Pseudo-Schiff propidium iodide (mPS-PI)
   method. While commonly used for Arabidopsis tissues, its application to
   other species like the model crop rice required protocol adaptations for
   obtaining robust staining that we present here. The procedure comprises
   six steps: (a) Material sampling; (b) Material fixation; (c) Tissue
   preparation; (d) Staining; (e) Sample mounting; and (d) Microscopy
   imaging. Particularly, we use ethanol and acetic anhydride as fixative
   reagents. A modified enzymatic treatment proved essential for starch
   degradation influencing optical clarity hence allowing acquisition of
   images at high resolution. This improved protocol is efficient for
   analyzing the megaspore mother cells in rice (Oryza sativa) ovary but is
   broadly applicable to other crop tissues of complex composition, without
   the need for tissue sectioning.}},

Abstract = {{Although traditional remote sensing systems based on spectral
   reflectance can already provide estimates of the ``potential{''}
   photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation through the
   quantification of total canopy chlorophyll content or absorbed
   photosynthetic radiation, the determination of the ``actual{''}
   photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation requires information
   about how the absorbed light is used by plants, such as vegetation
   fluorescence, using very high spectral resolution spectroscopy in the
   range 650-800 nm. The Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) mission, selected in
   November 2015 as the 8th Earth Explorer by the European Space Agency
   (ESA), carries the FLORIS spectrometer, with a spectral resolution of
   0.3 nm and a spatial resolution of 300 m, with a swath of 150 km. The
   FLEX mission is designed to fly in tandem with the Copernicus Sentinel-3
   satellite, in order to provide all the necessary information to
   disentangle emitted fluorescence from the background reflected radiance,
   and to allow proper interpretation of the fluorescence spatial and
   temporal changes in relation to photosynthesis dynamics, accounting for
   non-photochemical energy dissipation and canopy temperature effects.}},

Pages = {{811-828}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Although the importance of climate change is generally
   acknowledged, its impacts are often not taken into account explicitly
   when planning development projects. This being due to limited resources,
   among others, this paper aims to propose a simple and low-cost approach
   to assess the viability of human activities under climate change.
   Design/methodology/approach - Many human activities are feasible only
   within a narrow range of climatic conditions. Comparing such ``climate
   corridors{''} with future climate projections provides an intuitive yet
   quantitative means for assessing needs for, and the viability of,
   adaptation activities under climate change.
   Findings - The approach was tested within development projects in
   Pakistan, Peru and Tajikistan. The approach was shown to work well for
   forestry and agriculture, indicating positive/negative prospects for
   wheat in two districts in Pakistan, temperature constraints for maize in
   Peru and widening elevation ranges for walnut trees in Tajikistan.
   Practical implications - Climate corridor analyses feed into the
   preparation of Local Adaptation Plans of Action in Pakistan.
   Originality/value - The simplicity and robustness of climate corridor
   analysis allow for efficient analysis and communication of climate
   change impacts. It works when data availability is limited, but it can
   as well accommodate a wide range of complexities. It has proven to be an
   effective vehicle for mainstreaming climate change into adaptation
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the most prominent technique for the
   assessment of environmental impacts of products, typically operates on
   the basis of average meteorological and ecological conditions of whole
   countries or large regions. This limits the representativeness and
   accuracy of LCA, particularly in the field of agriculture. The
   production processes associated with agricultural commodities are
   characterized by high spatial sensitivity as both inputs (e.g. mineral
   and organic fertilizers) and the accompanying release of emissions into
   soil, air and water (e.g. nitrate, dinitrogen monoxide, or phosphate
   emissions) are largely determined by micro-spatial environmental
   parameters (precipitation, soil properties, slope, etc.) and therefore
   highly context dependent. This spatial variability is vastly ignored
   under the ``unit world{''} assumption inherent to LCA. In this paper, we
   present a new calculation framework for regionalized life cycle
   inventory modeling that aims to overcome this inherent limitation. The
   framework allows an automated, site-specific generation and assessment
   of regionalized unit process datasets. We demonstrate the framework in a
   case study on rapeseed cultivation in Germany. The results from the
   research are (i) a framework for generating regionalized data
   structures, and (ii) a first examination of the significance of further
   use cases.}},

Abstract = {{Receiver bias in plant-animal interactions is here defined as
   ``selection mediated by behavioral responses of animals, where those
   responses have evolved in a context outside the interactions.{''} As a
   consequence, the responses are not necessarily linked to fitness gains
   in interacting animals. Thus, receiver bias can help explain seemingly
   maladaptive patterns of behavior in interacting animals and the
   evolution of plant traits that trigger such behavior. In this review, I
   discuss principles of receiver bias, show its overlap with mimicry and
   how it differs from mimicry, and outline examples in different
   plant-animal interactions. The most numerous and best documented
   examples of receiver bias occur within plant-pollinator interactions. I
   elaborate on the ability of some plants to heat up their flowers (i.e.,
   floral thermogenesis) and argue that this trait likely evolved under
   receiver bias, especially in pollination systems with oviposition
   mimicry. Further examples include signals in insect-mediated seed
   dispersal and plant defense through repellence of aphids. These examples
   show that receiver bias is widespread in different plant-animal
   interactions. For a broader understanding of the role of receiver bias
   in those interactions, we need more data on how animals respond to plant
   signals, the context and evolutionary history of those behaviors, and
   the evolutionary patterns of plant signals.}},

   aerial images. These two tasks are traditionally addressed separately in
   remote sensing, despite their strong correlation. Therefore, a model
   learning both height and classes jointly seems advantageous and so, we
   propose a multitask Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with
   two losses: one performing semantic labeling, and another predicting
   normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) from the pixel values. Since the
   nDSM/height information is used only in the second loss, there is no
   need to have a nDSM map at test time, and the model can estimate height
   automatically on new images. We test our proposed method on a set of
   sub-decimeter resolution images and show that our model equals the
   performances of two separate models, but at the cost of a single one.}},

Abstract = {{``Map-based cloning{''} is a frequently used approach to isolate rust
   resistance genes. A critical step during map-based cloning is the
   transition from genetic information, i.e., a genetic map, to physical
   sequence information. Bacterial artificial chromosome clones are often
   used to establish sequence information spanning a genetic interval.
   However, a major limitation of BAC clones consists in their small insert
   size of 100-200 kb. Targeted chromosome-based cloning via long-range
   assembly (TACCA) is a method that can replace BAC library screening.
   This approach involves chromosome flow-sorting and the establishment of
   a long-range de novo assembly. This chapter provides an overview of
   TACCA as well as a detailed description of sequence analyses, molecular
   marker development, and candidate gene identification.}},

Abstract = {{The study of land use at large scale has recently been approached as the
   description of a territory in terms of Local Climate Zones (LCZ). These
   are subdivisions of a landscape into a set of categories which are of
   uniform coverage, represent similar land cover characteristics and
   patterns and are of several hundreds of meters in surface. Specifically,
   we map the region of NorthRhine-Westfalia (Germany), a region of approx.
   34'000 km(2), in terms of LCZ, with a statistical model trained using
   multimodal geospatial data (remote sensing, land cover, 3D models and
   volunteered geographic information) and constrained with both spatial
   interaction and scaling behavior logics. The proposed model improves LCZ
   classification accuracy, in particular for scarce classes, with an
   increase of up to 4 K points and 5\% in average accuracy as compared to
   conventional pixelwise classification.}},

Volume = {{1669}},
Pages = {{3-15}},
Abstract = {{In this introductory chapter, we describe male germline development in
   plants taking Arabidopsis thaliana as a reference species. We first
   describe the transition from sporophytic to germline development, then
   microsporogenesis including meiosis, followed by male gametophyte
   development prior to pollination, and finally the progamic phase
   culminating in double fertilization, which leads to the formation of the
   embryo and the endosperm. For detailed information on some of these
   processes or on the molecular underpinning of certain fate transitions,
   we refer the reader to recent reviews. An important but often neglected
   aspect of male gametophyte development is the formation of the unique
   pollen cell wall. In contrast to that of other plant cells, the pollen
   cell wall is composed of two principal layers, the intine and exine.
   While the intine, the inner pecto-cellulosic cell wall layer, is
   biochemically and structurally similar to a ``classical{''} plant cell
   wall, the exine is a unique composite with sporopollenin as its main
   component. Biosynthesis of the cell wall is remarkably similar between
   the spores of mosses and ferns, and pollen of seed plants, although
   slight differences exist, even between closely related species (reviewed
   in Wallace et al., AoB Plants 2011: plr027, 2011). In the latter
   sections of this chapter, we will present a brief overview of cell wall
   development in Arabidopsis pollen, where this aspect has been
   intensively studied.}},

Abstract = {{Epigenetic control of plant development via histone modifications is
   involved in different processes ranging from embryonic development,
   vegetative development, flowering time control, floral organ
   development, to pollen tube growth. The identification of an increasing
   number of epigenetically regulated processes was greatly advanced by
   methods allowing the survey of genome-wide histone modifications and
   chromatin-protein interactions. However, genome-wide approaches are too
   broad to access in detail a large number of histone modifications taking
   place at a single locus. Here, we provide a robust chromatin
   immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocol, allowing in vivo analyses of
   multiple chromatin modifications and binding of histone modifiers in
   different plant organs and tissues. This method is quantitative and
   provides a way to study the dynamic state of chromatin during plant
   development and also in response to different environmental stimuli.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Natural selection favours increased investment in reproduction, yet
   considerable variation in parental investment is observed in natural
   populations. Life-history theory predicts that this variation is
   maintained by a trade-off between the benefits of increased reproductive
   investment and its associated costs for the parents. The nature of these
   costs of reproduction, however, remains poorly understood. The brain is
   an energetically highly expensive organ and increased reproductive
   investment may, therefore, negatively affect brain maintenance. Using
   artificial selection lines for high and low prenatal maternal investment
   in a precocial bird, the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), we provide
   experimental evidence for this hypothesis by showing that increased
   prenatal provisioning negatively affects the size of a particular brain
   region of the mother, the cerebellum. Our finding suggests that
   cognitive demands may constrain the evolution of parental investment,
   and vice versa, contributing to the maintenance of variation in
   reproductive behaviour in animal populations.}},

Abstract = {{The largest Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) databases contain about 10,000
   unit process datasets. Assuming that updating one dataset would, on
   average, require one working day, then updating the entire database
   would roughly require the continuous work of five workers for ten years.
   Methods are therefore needed to prioritize datasets to be updated, and
   such a method should be able to identify the unit processes that
   contribute the most across different Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)
   methods. To date, such prioritization methods are not available.
   This paper presents an operational prioritization method. We demonstrate
   and evaluate our method by applying it to the ecoinvent database. The
   case study shows that prioritization of improvement efforts is highly
   useful because a robust nucleus of unit processes proves to be
   consistently important across all product systems and many LCIA methods.
   Focusing research efforts on these processes allows the effective
   improvement of the LCI database. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{India is a fast growing economy with a fast growing population.
   Estimations indicate that in the next few years, it will be the world's
   most populous country, with China only second. These developments,
   together with high urbanization rates, are putting increasing pressure
   on the energy sector and driving the attention to energy efficiency. The
   issue is not only financial but also social and environmental. One of
   the schemes developed to promote energy efficiency in the residential
   housing sector is the Super Efficient Equipment Program (SEEP), which
   aims at reducing energy consumption in Indian households, by subsidizing
   the production of super efficient fans. Emphasis is put into increasing
   economies of scale and balancing possible losses in market power for
   producers. However, the scheme does not take into consideration
   consumers' behavior in the market and their purchasing propensity toward
   energy efficient fans. In this article, we develop an econometric model
   that takes consumers' preferences and behavior into consideration, by
   analyzing how these influence the success of the SEEP scheme. To do so,
   the price elasticity of energy efficient fans is calculated. We will
   then apply it to the SEEP subsidy scheme in order to assess how the
   quantity of super efficient fans sold varies with changes in the price.
   Using projected data on residential housing floor space in India, we
   will estimate the percentage of super efficient fans sold and calculate
   future energy savings. We are finally able to infer whether the SEEP
   scheme is capable of meeting its goals.}},

Abstract = {{Press conferences are an important element of a government's
   communication strategy at climate change summits. From a theoretical
   perspective, press conferences should serve two main functions: exerting
   pressure in negotiations and informing the public. These functions
   correspond to two logics of action: a logic of consequence where
   governments use press conferences as negotiation tools and a logic of
   appropriateness where governments organize press conferences to increase
   transparency. Based on new data from the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change archives, we find limited support for these
   two logics of action. Neither democracies, which, we argue, are more
   likely to follow a logic of appropriateness, nor vulnerable countries,
   which are more likely to follow a logic of consequence, organize
   systematically more press conferences. Other factors, such as capacity
   and a government's function in the negotiation structure, seem to play a
   more important role.}},

Abstract = {{Sex-linkage is predicted to evolve in response to sex-specific or
   sexually antagonistic selection. In line with this prediction, most
   sex-linked genes are associated with reproduction in the respective sex.
   In addition to traits directly involved in fertility and fecundity,
   mediators of maternal effects may be predisposed to evolve sex-linkage,
   because they indirectly affect female fitness through their effect on
   offspring phenotype. Here, we test for sex-linked inheritance of a key
   mediator of prenatal maternal effects in oviparous species, the transfer
   of maternally derived testosterone to the eggs. Consistent with maternal
   inheritance, we found that in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)
   granddaughters resemble their maternal (but not their paternal)
   grandmother in yolk testosterone deposition. This pattern of resemblance
   was not due to non-genetic priming effects of testosterone exposure
   during prenatal development, as an experimental manipulation of yolk
   testosterone levels did not affect the females' testosterone transfer to
   their own eggs later in life. Instead, W chromosome and/or mitochondrial
   variation may underlie the observed matrilineal inheritance pattern.
   Ultimately, the inheritance of mediators of maternal effects along the
   maternal line will allow for a fast and direct response to
   female-specific selection, thereby affecting the dynamics of
   evolutionary processes mediated by maternal effects.}},

Abstract = {{Few fossil vertebrate skeletons are complete and fully articulated.
   Various taphonomic processes reduce the skeletal fidelity of decaying
   carcasses, the effects of most of which are reasonably well understood.
   Some fossil vertebrates, however, exhibit patterns of disarticulation
   and loss of completeness that are difficult to explain. Such skeletons
   are one of two variants. They are incomplete, often markedly so, but the
   preserved parts are highly articulated. Alternatively, they are
   complete, or nearly so, but articulation varies markedly between parts
   of the body. A characteristic feature is the absence of skeletal
   elements that, on the basis of their larger size and/or greater density,
   would be predicted to be present. Here we erect a model, termed ``stick
   `n' peel{''}, that explains how these distinctive patterns originate.
   The model emphasizes the role of decay products, especially fluids
   released from the carcass while resting on the sediment surface. These
   fluids permeate the sediment below and around the carcass. As a result,
   skeletal elements on the downward facing side of the carcass become
   adhered to the sediment surface, and are less likely to be remobilized
   as a result of current activity than others. The pattern of articulation
   and, especially, completeness is thus not what would be predicted on the
   basis of the size, shape and density of the skeletal elements. The
   effects of stick `n' peel are difficult to predict a priori. Stick `n'
   peel has been identified in vertebrate fossils in lacustrine and marine
   settings and is likely to be a common feature of the taphonomic history
   of many vertebrate assemblages. Specimens becoming adhered to the
   substrate may also explain the preservation in situ of the multi-element
   skeletons of invertebrates such as echinoderms, and integumentary
   structures such as hair and feathers in exceptionally preserved fossils.

Abstract = {{Twenty-seven species of the genus Onchocerca (Nematoda; Filarioidea) can
   cause a vector-borne parasitic disease called onchocercosis. Most
   Onchocerca species infect wild and domestic ungulates or the dog, and
   one species causes river blindness in humans mainly in tropical Africa.
   The European red deer (Cervus e. elaphus) is host to four species, which
   are transmitted by blackflies (simuliids) or biting midges
   (ceratopogonids). Two species, Onchocerca flexuosa and Onchocerca
   jakutensis, produce subcutaneous nodules, whereas Onchocerca skrjabini
   and Onchocerca garmsi live free in the hypodermal serous membranes.
   During the hunting season, September 2013, red deer (n = 25), roe deer
   (Capreolus c. capreolus, n = 6) and chamois (Rupicapra r. rupicapra, n =
   7), all shot in the Grisons Region (Switzerland) were investigated for
   the presence of subcutaneous nodules which were enzymatically digested,
   and the contained Onchocerca worms were identified to species by light
   and scanning electron microscopy as well as by PCR/sequencing. In
   addition, microfilariae from skin samples were collected and genetically
   characterized. Neither nodules nor microfilariae were discovered in the
   roe deer and chamois. Adult worms were found in 24\% of red deer, and
   all of them were identified as O. jakutensis. Two morphologically
   different microfilariae were obtained from five red deer, and genetic
   analysis of a skin sample of one red deer indicated the presence of
   another Onchocerca species. This is the first report of O. jakutensis in
   Switzerland with a prevalence in red deer similar to that in
   neighbouring Germany. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Title = {{Potential of MODIS data to track the variability in ecosystem water-use
   efficiency of temperate deciduous forests}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important linkage that coupled terrestrial carbon and
   water cycles is ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE), which is also
   relevant to the appropriate ecosystem management actions. The eddy
   covariance technique provides continuous observations of carbon and
   water fluxes at the landscape level, presenting an opportunity to infer
   ecosystem WUE at daily or annual time scales. Scaling up such
   measurements to regional or national scale, however, remains
   challenging. Few studies have been reported on direct estimation of WUE
   from remotely-sensed data, particularly the seasonal dynamics of
   forests. Therefore, this study aims to assess the potential of tracking
   the variability in WUE by exclusively using time-series MODIS data at 8
   flux tower sites of temperate deciduous forests. Our analyses showed
   that the 8-day variations in WUE were mainly subject to control by
   temperature, solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit. As a proxy of
   plant response to the environmental controls, MODIS-derived vegetation
   index was found to strongly correlate with ecosystem WUE and could be
   used for remote quantification. Then, both performance of the indirect
   WUE estimated from MODIS GPP and ET products (WUEMOD) and the direct
   estimates from MODIS data using the calibrated temperature and greenness
   (TG) model were evaluated using tower-based measurements (WUEEc). In
   general, WUEEc was overly predicted at the start and end of the
   vegetation period and badly underestimated during the summertime by
   WUEMOD because of the discrepancy in GPPMOD. However, the proposed TG
   model provided substantially good estimates of ecosystem WUE in spite of
   lacking skills in monitoring summer troughs. Independent validation at
   four additional sites further certified the improvement, which provided
   a new framework for quantifying the seasonal variations in ecosystem
   WUE. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a new approach for spectral-spatial classification of
   hyperspectral images has been proposed by Tarabalka et al. This approach
   is based on the Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF) grown from automatically
   selected markers by using the Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   classification. This paper aims at improving this approach by means of a
   new method for the selection of markers. This method is a combination of
   SVM and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network classifiers. In the
   proposed method, the most reliable pixels, i.e. markers, are extracted
   from the classification maps and used to build the MSF. Three scenarios
   are evaluated for the first stage of marker selection: SVM, MPL and
   combination of SVM and MPL. Experimental results on two benchmark
   hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
   significantly improves the classification accuracies compared to the
   approach based on the SVM classification.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem services (ES) generate benefits to human well-being but
   quality and amount of their provisioning is threatened by environmental
   change. Remote sensing techniques allow assessments of ES at critical
   scales using combinations of remotely measurable ecosystem properties.
   In this contribution, we use an ES assessement approach suggested by
   Homolova et al. {[}1] and extend it to estimate ES supply continuously
   for a heterogenous landscape across different Earth spheres using data
   of the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer. We further
   suggest a conceptional framework to combine ES maps to match the needs
   of different stakeholders. Our results show the heterogenuous supply of
   agronomic ES, carbon sequestration and cultural ES within the landscape
   and and its different ecosystems. Our proposed ES mapping approach and
   the conceptual framework developed for combining ES according to
   stakeholder requests, provide spatially explicit information on ES
   across heterogeneous landscapes and can therefore improve
   decision-making of stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs) is a remote sensing (RS)
   observable to be linked to plant photosynthesis. Variations of measured
   canopy Fs are, however, related to several effects in addition to a
   physiological response of plants. The impact of atmospheric scattering
   and absorption processes were identified as most critical if Fs
   retrievals are based on atmospheric O2-absorption bands. In this
   contribution, we aim to demonstrate the feasibility of airborne based Fs
   retrievals using the O2-A absorption band. We applied two airborne
   spectroscopy experiments including a non-imaging repeat track approach
   with changing flight altitudes and a multi temporal imaging approach
   using the new HyPlant spectrometer. Our results demonstrate that
   atmospheric effects can be compensated and accurate airborne based Fs
   measurements can be obtained using atmospheric absorption features. Our
   results are particularly important in view of ESA's potential Earth
   Explorer ``Fluorescence Explorer{''} (FLEX) mission that intents to
   provide high resolution global maps of Fs using atmospheric oxygen
   absorption features.}},

Title = {{A new generic system for the pantropical Caesalpinia group (Leguminosae)}},
Journal = {{PHYTOKEYS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{71, SI}},
Pages = {{1-160}},
Abstract = {{The Caesalpinia group is a large pantropical clade of ca. 205 species in
   subfamily Caesalpinioideae (Le-guminosae) in which generic delimitation
   has been in a state of considerable flux. Here we present new
   phylogenetic analyses based on five plastid and one nuclear ribosomal
   marker, with dense taxon sampling including 172 (84\%) of the species
   and representatives of all previously described genera in the
   Caesalpinia group. These analyses show that the current classification
   of the Caesalpinia group into 21 genera needs to be revised. Several
   genera (Poincianella, Erythrostemon, Cenostigma and Caesalpinia sensu
   Lewis, 2005) are non-monophyletic and several previously unclassified
   Asian species segregate into clades that merit recognition at generic
   rank. In addition, the near-completeness of our taxon sampling
   identifies three species that do not belong in any of the main clades
   and these are recognised as new monospecific genera. A new generic
   classification of the Caesalpinia group is presented including a key for
   the identification of genera, full generic descriptions, illustrations
   (drawings and photo plates of all genera), and (for most genera) the
   nomenclatural transfer of species to their correct genus. We recognise
   26 genera, with reinstatement of two previously described genera
   (Biancaea Tod., Denisophytum R. Vig.), re-delimitation and expansion of
   several others (Moullava, Cenostigma, Libidibia and Erythrostemon),
   contraction of Caesalpinia s.s. and description of four new ones
   (Gelrebia, Paubrasilia, Hererolandia and Hultholia), and make 75 new
   nomenclatural combinations in this new generic system.}},

Title = {{Global climate policy and local energy politics: is India hiding behind
   the poor?}},
Journal = {{CLIMATE POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{940-951}},
Abstract = {{Along with the large middle-income countries Brazil, China, and South
   Africa, India has been put under increasing pressure to shoulder parts
   of the mitigation burden and commit to national emission reduction
   targets. India, however, refers to its limited capacity and widespread
   poverty. Is India hiding behind its poor? While others examine the
   distribution of emissions within the country to answer this question, we
   study domestic policy making for energy subsidies and access to clean
   energy. Empirical evidence suggests that domestic policy making is at
   least partially consistent with the pro-poor arguments advanced at the
   international level. Given their large number and the country's
   democratic system, the poor do have some weight in Indian politics.
   However, pro-poor policies end where they do not translate into greater
   vote shares. Moreover, India's international position ignores the
   existing complementarities between climate-friendly and pro-poor
   activities.
   Policy relevance
   Despite India's recent growth spurt, its concern to fight energy poverty
   at home before engaging in any commitments on climate policy at the
   international level should be taken seriously within the international
   negotiations. Policy making in India is driven by democratic incentives,
   which, in this case, work to the benefit of the poor. Pro-poor policies
   may not go as far as one would wish from a developmental perspective,
   but the impact of the masses of the poor on domestic policy making is
   politically significant and cannot be ignored. This also provides some
   broader lessons for mitigation and adaptation policies in developing
   countries: politicians respond to incentives and support will only reach
   the needy if the appropriate incentives are in place. While we observe
   some significant commitment and implementation problems even in a
   democratic country like India, such problems must be expected to be even
   more serious elsewhere. This should not be overlooked when designing
   institutions for the allocation of climate finance, such as the Green
   Climate Fund.}},

Abstract = {{Plant functional traits can be used to study the interactions between
   plants and ecosystem functioning as well as the response of plants to
   various environmental pressures. Continuous monitoring of plant
   functional traits dynamics on a large spatial scale is important to
   understand the mechanisms of ecosystem function degradation, especially
   on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In this study, we investigated
   spatiotemporal trends of functional traits (i.e., chlorophyll content,
   leaf area index proxy of leaf size) in the eastern part of the
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau based on the combined analysis of multisensor
   satellite data and field observations at three spatial scales
   (groundtruth data at 1 m, Landsat at 30 m, MODIS at 500 m). Chlorophyll
   content was retrieved based on 94 field plots measurements. LAI was
   analyzed using MCD15A3H product and estimated values using digital
   hemispherical photographs in the field. The results show that field
   estimated LAI has better consistency with MCD15A3H product of main
   algorithm (QC<64). The chlorophyll has significant positive linear trend
   in 15 years (20012015) and has strong increasing trend in the low area,
   which is correspond to the high chlorophyll content spatial
   heterogeneity.}},

   (APEX) imaging spectrometer were used to derive products related to
   plant traits, e.g., leaf chlorophyll, carotenoid, anthocyanin, and water
   content, leaf greenness, biomass, and leaf area index. The Apex products
   were highly correlated to the related ground truth measurements in major
   crops under experimental and field situations. The relationship of APEX
   derived NDVI (NDVIAPEX) with ground measured NDVI and canopy cover is
   shown in detail. Additionally, interrelations between the aerial
   detected traits are discussed. The combination of the presented remotely
   measured plant traits can potentially give crop specific indications of
   their growth status and vitality. Such tools could help to improve
   resource use efficiency in agricultural systems and are needed for

Abstract = {{Traditional approaches to structured semantic segmentation employ
   appearance-based classifiers to provide a class-likelihood at each
   spatial location and then post-process it with Markov Random Fields
   (MRF) to enforce label smoothness and structure in the output space. The
   spatial support for such techniques is usually a patch of pixels, which
   makes the prediction over-smoothed because the borders of objects are
   not explicitly taken into account. This is further exacerbated by MRF
   post-processing employing the standard Potts model, which tends to
   further over-smooth predictions at boundaries. In this paper, we propose
   a different but related approach: we optimize an energy function finding
   the optimal combination of small ground truth (GT) tiles from training
   data over predictions at test time, effectively solving a puzzle. We
   optimize over a first configuration given by a Convolutional Neural
   Network (CNN) output.}},

Abstract = {{The number of endmembers (NOE) in hyperspectral imagery plays an
   important role in image analysis applications such as classification,
   clustering and unmixing. Over the last years, different algorithms have
   been proposed to estimate the NOE. Nonetheless, each method depends on
   its own parameters' values, and as a result, leads to different values
   for intrinsic dimensionality (ID). In this study a statistical-based
   method is proposed to evaluate different results of ID algorithms. In
   this method, the reasonable candidates of ID are selected using both
   residual analysis (RA) and Change-Point analysis (CPA). Different values
   for ID are then compared with these candidates. If these values are
   equal or close to these candidates they may be considered as the ID.
   Although the proposed method can be used for every ID method, here, the
   results of two new methods, namely, SML, and O-GENE-AH algorithms have
   been investigated on Pavia Center hyperspectral dataset.}},

Abstract = {{We provide an updated checklist and key to the 30 Poa species with open
   panicles from Peru which includes previously circumscribed Dissanthelium
   and Aphanelytrum species, new taxon records, and three undescribed
   species. Poa compressa, P. grisebachii, and P. leioclada are recorded
   from Peru for the first time. A number of species are placed in
   synonymy: Poa carazensis, P. ferreyrae and P. tovarii are synonymized
   under the name P. fibrifera; Poa adusta (tentatively) and P. pilgeri are
   synonymized under P. candamoana; Poa superata is synonymized under P.
   grisebachii; and Poa paramoensis is synonymized under P. huancavelicae.
   Included within this treatment are three new species, Poa ramoniana, P.
   tayacajaensis and P. urubambensis, which are described and illustrated.
   Poa ramoniana, found growing near lakes in high elevation Puna
   grasslands of Junn, is similar to a small form of P. glaberrima, but
   differs in having rhizomes and growing to only 5 cm tall. Poa
   tayacajaensis, found from shrublands on Andean slopes of Huancavelica
   and Huanuco, bears similarities to Poa aequatoriensis but differs in
   having shorter lemmas which are pubescent between the veins, densely
   scabrous sheaths with smooth, glabrous throats, and shorter ligules. Poa
   urubambensis, a common element of the undisturbed Polylepis forest
   understory of the Cordillera Urubamba, Cusco, is distinct from all other
   members of open-panicled Poa's by having glabrous lemmas with a smooth
   and glabrous callus, and notably small anthers. The type material for
   the name Poa adusta is discussed and a lectotype is selected.}},

Abstract = {{Our ability to measure, quantify and assimilate hydrological properties
   and processes of snow in operational models is disproportionally poor
   compared to the significance of seasonal snowmelt as a global water
   resource and major risk factor in flood and avalanche forecasting. We
   show here that strong electrical self-potential fields are generated in
   melting in situ snowpacks at Rhone Glacier and Jungfraujoch Glacier,
   Switzerland. In agreement with theory, the diurnal evolution of
   self-potential magnitudes (similar to 60-250 mV) relates to those of
   bulk meltwater fluxes (0-1.2 x 10(-6) m(3) s(-1)) principally through
   the permeability and the content, electrical conductivity and pH of
   liquid water. Previous work revealed that when fresh snow melts, ions
   are eluted in sequence and electrical conductivity, pH and
   self-potential data change diagnostically. Our snowpacks had experienced
   earlier stages of melt, and complementary snow pit measurements revealed
   that electrical conductivity (similar to 1-5 x 10(-6) S m(-1)) and pH
   (similar to 6.5-6.7) as well as permeabilities (respectively similar to
   9.7 x 10(-5) and similar to 4.3 x 10(-5) m(2) at Rhone Glacier and
   Jungfraujoch Glacier) were invariant. This implies, first, that
   preferential elution of ions was complete and, second, that our
   self-potential measurements reflect daily changes in liquid water
   contents. These were calculated to increase within the pendular regime
   from similar to 1 to 5 and similar to 3 to 5.5\% respectively at Rhone
   Glacier and Jungfraujoch Glacier, as confirmed by ground truth
   measurements. We conclude that the electrical self-potential method is a
   promising snow and firn hydrology sensor owing to its suitability for
   (1) sensing lateral and vertical liquid water flows directly and
   minimally invasively, (2) complementing established observational
   programs through multidimensional spatial mapping of meltwater fluxes or
   liquid water content and (3) monitoring autonomously at a low cost.
   Future work should focus on the development of self-potential sensor
   arrays compatible with existing weather and snow monitoring technology
   and observational programs, and the integration of self-potential data
   into analytical frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{Land-cover and land-use semantic labeling in centimeter resolution
   imagery (ultra-high resolution) is mostly performed by supervised
   classification of informative descriptors extracted from spatially
   coherent but small objects (e.g. superpixels or patches). In this paper,
   we propose an extension of this reasoning by proposing a class-specific,
   multi-scale and bottom-up object proposal strategy to perform semantic
   labeling. Specifically, we rely on a fully trainable boundary (edge)
   detector, allowing us to extract class-specific objectproposals. Such
   proposals enable training rich appearance and object models as well as
   enhanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate the proposed strategy on the
   Vaihingen dataset with promising results.}},

Abstract = {{The spectral and radiometric quality of airborne imaging spectrometer
   data is affected by the anisotropic reflectance behavior of the imaged
   surface. Illumination and observation angle-dependent patterns of
   surface reflected radiation propagate into products, hinder quantitative
   assessment of biophysical/biochemical parameters, and decrease the
   comparability of data from multiple flight lines. The Ross-Li model,
   originally developed for multiangular observations, can be inverted to
   estimate and correct for surface anisotropy effects. This requires land
   cover be stratified into distinct types of scattering behavior. When the
   observations subsumed in these classes cover a range of view angles, a
   pseudo multiangular view on the surface can be employed to invert the
   Ross-Li model. A discrete land cover classification, however, bears the
   risk of inappropriate scattering correction resulting in spatial
   artifacts in the corrected data, predominantly in transition regions of
   two land cover types (e.g., soil and sparse vegetation with varying
   fractions). We invert the Ross-Li model on continuous land cover
   fraction layers. We decompose land cover in dominating structural types
   using linear spectral unmixing. Ross-Li kernel weights and formulations
   are estimated for each type independently; the correction is then
   applied pixel-wise according to the fractional distribution. The
   corrected Airborne Prism EXperiment imaging spectrometer data show
   significant reduction of anisotropic reflectance effects of up to 90\%
   (average 60\% to 75\%, p = 0.05), measured in the overlapping regions of
   adjacent flight lines. No spatial artifacts or spectral irregularities
   are observed after correction.}},

Abstract = {{Offspring fitness generally improves with increasing egg size. Yet, eggs
   of most aquatic organisms are small. A common but largely untested
   assumption is that larger embryos require more oxygen than they can
   acquire through diffusion via the egg surface, constraining egg size
   evolution. However, we found no detrimental effects of large egg size on
   embryo growth and survival under hypoxic conditions. We tested this in
   the broad-nosed pipelish, Syngnathus typhle, whose males provide
   extensive care (nourishment, osmoregulation and oxygenation) to their
   young in a brood pouch on their bodies. We took advantage of this
   species' pronounced variation in egg size, correlating positively with
   female size, and tested the effect of hypoxia (40\% dissolved oxygen)
   versus fully oxygenated (100\%) water on embryo size and survival of
   large versus small eggs after 18 days of paternal brooding. Egg size did
   not affect embryo survival, regardless of O-2 treatment. While hypoxia
   affected embryo size negatively, both large and small eggs showed
   similar reductions in growth. Males in hypoxia ventilated more and males
   with large eggs swam more, but neither treatment affected their position
   in the water column. Overall, our results call into question the most
   common explanation for constrained egg size evolution in aquatic
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Change detection for high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
   imagery requires advanced denoising mechanisms to preserve details and
   minimize speckle. In this work, we propose a change detector based on a
   Morphological Component Analysis (MCA) of the scattering mechanisms
   provided with fully polarimetric data sets. With MCA, the power of each
   scattering mechanism is decomposed into diverse image features. By
   introducing a priori knowledge of the content of the scenes, and
   exploiting both the scattering mechanisms and their corresponding
   shapes, we can significantly improve performance, with fewer false
   alarms introduced by clutter, focusing errors, and inconsistent
   acquisition geometries.}},

Abstract = {{Kernel methods constitute a family of powerful machine learning
   algorithms, which have found wide use in remote sensing and geosciences.
   However, kernel methods are still not widely adopted because of the high
   computational cost when dealing with large scale problems, such as the
   inversion of radiative transfer models. This paper introduces the method
   of random kitchen sinks (RKS) for fast statistical retrieval of
   bio-geo-physical parameters. The RKS method allows to approximate a
   kernel matrix with a set of random bases sampled from the Fourier
   domain. We extend their use to other bases, such as wavelets, stumps,
   and Walsh expansions. We show that kernel regression is now possible for
   datasets with millions of examples and high dimensionality. Examples on
   atmospheric parameter retrieval from infrared sounders and biophysical
   parameter retrieval by inverting PROSAIL radiative transfer models with
   simulated Sentinel-2 data show the effectiveness of the technique.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method to characterize forest canopy structure in space and
   time based on vertical echo distributions from airborne laser scanning
   (ALS). We developed a transferable, grid-based method using ALS data
   combined with an automatic determination of the best feasible spatial
   unit for canopy structure characterization. We derive canopy structure
   types (CSTs) using a hierarchical, multi-scale classification approach
   based on Bayesian robust mixture models (BRMMs), which satisfy
   structurally homogenous criteria without the use of in-situ calibration
   information. The validation shows promising results for the CSTs,
   particularly in terms of seasonal and horizontal variations in vertical
   canopy structure. We conclude that our method can improve the robustness
   and reliability of canopy structure characterization. Future work will
   include tests of transferability to a larger variety of forests and
   extensive testing using CSTs as a structural classification scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The phase estimation of cross-track multibaseline synthetic aperture
   interferometric data is usually thought to be very efficiently achieved
   using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. The suitability of this method
   is investigated here as applied to airborne single pass multibaseline
   data. Experimental interferometric data acquired with a Ka-band sensor
   were processed using (a) a ML method that fuses the complex data from
   all receivers and (b) a coarse-to-fine method that only uses the
   intermediate baselines to unwrap the phase values from the longest
   baseline. The phase noise was analyzed for both methods: in most cases,
   a small improvement was found when the ML method was used.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing availability of Geo-Social Media (e.g. Facebook, Foursquare
   and Flickr) has led to the accumulation of large volumes of social media
   data. These data, especially geotagged ones, contain information about
   perception of and experiences in various environments. Harnessing these
   data can be used to provide a better understanding of the semantics of
   places. We are interested in the similarities or differences between
   different Geo-Social Media in the description of places. This extended
   abstract presents the results of a first step towards a more in-depth
   study of semantic similarity of places. Particularly, we took places
   extracted through spatio-temporal clustering from one data source
   (Twitter) and examined whether their structure is reflected semantically
   in another data set (Flickr). Based on that, we analyse how the semantic
   similarity between places varies over space and scale, and how Tobler's
   first law of geography holds with regards to scale and places.}},

Abstract = {{Floral morphology often directly influences interactions with

   We studied the relationship between bract motility, floral structural
   specialization and pollination in Dalechampia aff. bernieri, an endemic
   Madagascan species with floral structures indicating specialized
   buzz-pollination. We measured circadian bract angles in 47
   inflorescences from 11 plants of D. aff. bernieri; in addition, we
   recorded any flower-visiting insects observed. The inflorescences had
   motile bracts with mean angles varying from similar to 50 degrees at
   00h00 to similar to 90 degrees at 10h45. They were visited by
   buzz-pollinating Nomia viridilimbata bees (Halictidae), but also by
   non-buzz-pollinating Liotrigona bees (Apidae). The temporal pattern of
   bract motility observed in D. aff. bernieri may represent an
   extra-floral specialization to reduce visitation by non-pollinating
   visitors while maximizing visitation by diurnal buzz-pollinating bees.}},

Abstract = {{Re-using models trained on a specific image acquisition to classify
   landcover in another image is no easy task. Illumination effects,
   specific angular configurations, abrupt and simple seasonal changes make
   that the spectra observed, even though representing the same kind of
   surface, drift in a way that prevents a non-adapted model to perform
   well. In this paper we propose a relative normalization technique to
   perform domain adaptation, i.e. to make the data distribution in the
   images more similar before classification. We study optimal transport as
   a way to match the image-specific distributions and propose two
   regularization schemes, one unsupervised and one semi-supervised, to
   obtain more robust and semantic matchings. Code is available at
   http://remi.flamary.com/soft/soft-transp.html. Experiments on a
   challenging triplet of WorldView2 images, comparing three neighborhoods
   of the city of Zurich at different time instants, confirm the
   effectiveness of the proposed method that can perform adaptation in
   these non-coregistered and very different urban case studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims at presenting programs targeted at the prevention of
   adolescent depression applied with Spanish-speaking populations that
   have been developed in Spanish-speaking countries and are mostly
   published in Spanish. These programs have been developed under different
   cultural contexts in Spain and Latin-America. The main goal of this
   paper is to make the studies and movements of the Spanish-speaking
   literature in this field accessible to the non-Spanish-speaking part of
   the research community. Therefore, after an introduction referring to
   possible cultural differences regarding depression in general and
   epidemiological basics, several programs are introduced. In total 11
   programs will be shortly presented and discussed. After revising the
   programs it can be concluded that in the Spanish-speaking world many
   programs have been developed and conducted following current state of
   the art-approaches for adolescent depression prevention. Further
   research is needed especially targeting possible cultural and contextual
   aspects of prevention measures and their efficacy and efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{We show strong geographical patterning in the morphological and
   especially the anatomical variation in the widespread southern African
   danthonioid grass species, Tenaxia disticha. Four varieties can be
   discriminated, and are formally recognized here as Tenaxia disticha var.
   disticha, var. vlokii H. P. Linder, var. dracomontana H. P. Linder and
   var. htstricola H. P. Linder. Tenaxia disticha var. disticha is
   widespread in eastern southern Africa, from Cape Ag-ulhas at the
   southern tip of Africa to Inyangani in Zimbabwe; the other three
   varieties are highly localized: var. vlokii in the southern Cape and
   vars. dracomontana and lustricola on the high plateau of the
   Drakensberg. Plastid DNA nucleotide variation revealed only limited
   geographical pattern, but all regions and all varieties have numerous
   haplotypes, with no haplotype-poor areas. This is consistent with a
   model wherein this grass species has occupied its current distribution
   range for a long time, possibly since the Late Miocene, thus allowing
   the accumulation of local haplotype diversity. The divergence of the
   Drakensberg varieties may have been stimulated by the Pliocene uplift of
   these mountains resulting in a sub-alpine climate. This
   phylogeographical model is consistent with the hypothesis that southern
   Africa was not subjected to the dramatic Pleistocene climatic
   fluctuations driving extensive range changes which were typical of the
   temperate Northern Hemisphere phylogeographical patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Stagonospora nodorum glume blotch (SNG), caused by the necrotrophic
   fungus Stagonospora nodorum, is one of the economically important
   diseases of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Resistance to SNG is
   known to be quantitative and previous studies of a recombinant inbred
   line (RIL) population identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL)
   for resistance to SNG on the short arm of chromosome 3B. To localize
   this QTL (QSng.sfr-3BS) with high resolution, we constructed a genetic
   map for the QTL target region using information from sequenced
   flow-sorted chromosomes 3B of the two parental cultivars `Arina' and
   `Forno', the physical map of chromosome 3B of cultivar `Chinese Spring'
   and BAC-clone sequences. The mapping population of near-isogenic lines
   (NIL) was evaluated for SNG resistance in field infection tests. NILs
   segregated for disease resistance as well as for plant height;
   additionally, we observed a high environmental influence on the trait.
   Our analysis detected a strong negative correlation of SNG resistance
   and plant height. Further analysis of the target region identified two
   linked loci associated with SNG resistance. One of them was also
   associated with plant height, revealing an effect of QSng.sfr-3BS on
   plant height that was hidden in the RIL population. This result
   demonstrates an unexpectedly high genetic complexity of resistance
   controlled by QSng.sfr-3BS and shows the importance of the study of QTL
   in mendelized form in NILs.}},

Abstract = {{The length of a rowing stroke is an important performance metric for
   athletes and coaches. Accurate measurements are possible with optical or
   mechanical systems, which require significant setup effort. This work
   presents a new approach using a smart phone as a sensor device that is
   strapped to the oar. Two algorithms are introduced to calculate stroke
   lengths from the raw phone sensor data. The performance of each
   algorithm is evaluated by comparing the results to a mechanical
   reference system. Data was recorded during a single-user study performed
   on a rowing simulator. The best algorithm showed an average stroke
   length error of 7.64 degrees +/- 2.95 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{Airborne real-time observation of large areas with multi sensor systems
   is a very important capability for many modern military and civil
   applications. To demonstrate the possibilities of current technologies
   for this application, the high performance 35 GHz SAR sensor MIRANDA35
   and the high resolution optical camera DigiCAM-40 were successfully
   implemented on the optionally piloted aircraft (OPA) Centaur. The most
   remarkable feature of this sensor system is the use of a FMCW Radar with
   high transmit power as a SAR sensor in combination with a high
   resolution optical camera. Furthermore, the real-time images of this
   multi sensor system were transferred via digital data link over a
   distance of more than 100 km to a ground station for fast data analysis.
   The stored radar and camera data were used for further offline
   processing at a high level of image resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Research is often inspired by visions of the future. These visions can
   take on various narrative forms, and can fall anywhere along the
   spectrum from utopian to dystopian.
   Even though we recognize the importance of such visions to help us shape
   research questions and inspire rich design spaces to be explored, the
   opportunity to discuss them is rarely given in a research context.
   Imagine how civilization will have changed in 15 years. What is your
   vision for systems that will be supporting sustainability in that time?
   Which transformational changes will have occurred in the mean time that
   allow for these systems? Is ICT even the right tool or does it
   contradict sustainability by making our world ever more complex? How can
   we make systems and our societies more sustainable and resilient by
   ICT4S?
   This paper presents a compilation of fictional abstracts for inspiration
   and discussion, and provides means to stimulate discussion on future
   research and contributes to ICT4S community building.}},

Abstract = {{The progress of technological development and the resulting rapid
   replacement of end-user devices has brought increasing issues of
   electronics waste upon our society. Interaction designers and
   researchers within the field of Human-Computer Interaction have begun to
   tackle issues of environmental sustainability in recent years, including
   the problem of obsolescence. By considering the experiential aspects of
   obsolescence and the ways in which interaction design could have an
   impact on experience, the field presents promising approaches with
   potential to contribute to and complement current materials-focused
   solutions. In this chapter, we report on a survey of sustainable
   human-computer interaction research that investigates or addresses
   issues of obsolescence, presenting challenges as well as opportunities
   for interaction designers to contribute to solving these issues.}},

Title = {{Comparison of multiple models for remote sensing of carbon exchange
   using MODIS data in conifer-dominated forests}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{8252-8271}},
Abstract = {{Boreal forests in the northern hemisphere provide important sinks for
   storing carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the size and distribution of
   these sinks remain uncertain. In particular, many remote-sensing models
   show a strong bias in the simulation of carbon fluxes for evergreen
   needleleaf forest. The objective of this study is to improve these
   predictive models for accurately quantifying temporal changes in the net
   ecosystem exchange (NEE) of conifer-dominated forest solely based on
   satellite remote sensing, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra daytime land-surface temperature (LST),
   night-time LST', enhanced vegetation index (EVI), land-surface water
   index (LSWI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation
   (FPAR), and leaf area index (LAI). Considering that the component
   fluxes, gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (R-e),
   are strongly influenced by vegetation phenology, seasonality information
   was extracted from time-series MODIS EVI data based on non-linear
   least-squares fits of asymmetric Gaussian model functions with a
   software package for analysing the time-series of satellite sensor data
   (TIMESAT). The results indicated that models directly incorporating
   phenological information failed to improve their performance for
   temperate deciduous forest. Instead, three methods to retrieve the
   component fluxes - GPP and R-e - including direct estimates, models
   incorporating the phenological information, and models developed based
   on the threshold value (LST 273 K), were explored respectively. All
   methods improved NEE estimates markedly and models developed based on
   the threshold value performed best, and provided a future framework for
   accurate remote sensing of NEE in evergreen forest.}},

Abstract = {{The Swiss bryophyte collection of Paul Culmann in the herbarium Zurich
   (acronym: Z) has been digitalised and the data are now stored in a
   relational database. The collection contains 12,536 specimens with
   detailed information on locality, altitude, collecting date, and
   ecology. The specimens were collected between 1876 and 1923. They belong
   to 756 taxa, which is 69\% of the taxa known today from Switzerland.
   From a systematic point of view they well represent the Swiss bryophyte
   flora, as nearly all families are covered and there is no bias on either
   liverworts or mosses. Geographically, the data are less even
   distributed, because Paul Culmann collected preferentially in two
   regions: the canton of Zurich and the ``Berner Oberland{''} (southern,
   alpine part of the canton of Bern). Therefore, many of his specimens are
   from higher altitudes, whereas lower regions are underrepresented.
   Despite the uneven geographical distribution, the data are a most
   valuable source for analysis of changes in the bryophyte flora of
   Switzerland.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Primula halleri is a high alpine endemic species
   with a patchy distribution in Central and Eastern European mountains.
   Little is known about the structure of genetic variation and mating
   system in populations of this species.
   Methods and Results: We report on the development of 12 novel,
   polymorphic microsatellite loci for P. halleri. Tests for amplification
   and polymorphism were performed on 45 individuals sampled from three
   populations in the Swiss Alps. Interspecific amplification of the loci
   was evaluated using samples of the closely related species P. farinosa,
   P. frondosa, and P. scotica.
   Conclusions: The results show that the new microsatellite loci will be
   useful to study the structure of genetic diversity and mating system of
   P. halleri, and possibly its closely related species.}},

Abstract = {{Visitor to Conservation areas rarely expect to hear engine noise while
   hiking through. pristine natural surroundings. Rather, they expect the
   absence of human induced emissions and therefore react sensitively to
   unnatural noise. Many visitors of the Swiss Notional Park - our case
   study area - are disturbed by noise emissions of motorcycles driving
   over the Ofenpass, a road that runs right through the park. Some of them
   are calling for a reduction of this noise or even for a ban of
   motorcycles on the Ofenpass road. Motorcyclists, however, are also
   spending money in the region and contribute to the economic livelihood
   of its inhabitants. The article focuses on motorcyclists end their
   perception of the-park and the noise they are producing. In-depth
   information about this special practice in the park region was gathered
   through a triangulation between qualitative interviews, quantitative
   questionnaires and participant observation. The results show that
   motorcyclists are a heterogeneous group of tourists, who fulfil their
   driving passion and lust for travel through their hobby. The majority of
   them are aware of the noise problem and other emissions they produce and
   demonstrate an understanding for potential measures to reduce noise. The
   article concludes with recommendations for mitigating problems related
   to motorcycling and noise emissions in protected areas.}},

Abstract = {{Adequate assessment and management of landscape patterns and processes
   need proper representation and quantification of gradients of ecosystem
   biochemical and structural properties. Discrete land cover mapping
   approaches represent landscapes as classified entities with ``hard{''}
   boundaries. On the other hand, continuous field representations of land
   cover or ecosystem parameters offer the potential to overcome the
   limitations of classified entities that can often not reproduce the full
   range and variability of land surface properties. This paper presents a
   concept to generate continuous fields (CF) maps of ecosystem parameters
   in an alpine environment. The concept is exemplarily presented on a high
   mountain ecosystem's total (above ground) water content and is performed
   in the upper Trupchun valley (Val Trupchun) in the Swiss National Park
   (SNP). It is applicable to further parameters. Airborne Prism EXperiment
   (APEX) imaging spectrometer (IS) data collected over the SNP in June
   2010 and 2011 are used for CF mapping of water content. Abundance maps
   of predominant land cover classes are derived from linear spectral
   mixture analysis (SMA). They are then combined with individual thematic
   water content information of the respective land cover originating from
   either spectral indices or a physically based approach. The resulting
   product depicts a spatially continuous representation of total water
   content. The availability of APEX IS data from two consecutive seasons
   allows studying differences in ecosystem water content over time. CF
   maps can be generated for a wide range of ecosystem parameters. If
   multi-temporally available, such products can be useful for explaining
   ecological patterns such as animal grazing patterns in SNP.}},

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need within the international remote sensing
   community to establish a metadata standard for field spectroscopy that
   ensures high quality, interoperable metadata sets that can be archived
   and shared efficiently within Earth observation data sharing systems.
   Careful examination of all stages of metadata collection and analysis
   can inform a robust standard that is applicable to a range of field
   campaigns. This paper presents approaches towards a standard that
   encompasses in situ metadata collection and initiatives towards sharing
   metadata within intelligent archiving systems.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate mapping of forest species composition is an important aspect of
   monitoring and management planning related to ecosystem functions and
   services associated with water refinement, carbon sequestration,
   biodiversity, and wildlife habitats. Although different vegetation
   species often have unique spectral signatures, mapping based on spectral
   reflectance properties alone is often an ill-posed problem, since the
   spectral signature is as well influenced by age, canopy gaps, shadows
   and background characteristics. Thus, reducing the unknown variation by
   knowing the structural parameters of different species should improve
   determination procedures. In this study we combine imaging spectrometry
   (IS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data of a mixed needle and
   broadleaf forest to differentiate tree species more accurately as
   single-instrument data could do. Since forest inventory data in dense
   forests involve uncertainties, we tried to refine them by using
   individual tree crowns (ITC) position and shape, which derived from ALS
   data. Comparison of the extracted spectra from original field data and
   the modified one shows how ALS-derived shape and position of ITCs can
   improve separablity of the different species. The spatially explicit
   information layers containing both the spectral and structural
   components from the IS and ALS datasets were then combined by using a
   non-parametric support vector machine (SVM) classifier.}},

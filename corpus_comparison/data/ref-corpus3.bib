Title = {{Creating Multi-Temporal Composites of Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy Data
   in Support of Digital Soil Mapping}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},

Abstract = {{An increasing demand for full spatio-temporal coverage of soil
   information drives the growing use of soil spectroscopy. Soil
   spectroscopy application performed under laboratory conditions or
   in-field studies in semi-arid areas have shown promising results.
   However, when acquiring data in temperate zones, limitations by
   vegetation-free coverage, variation in soil moisture and management are
   driving coherent spatio-temporal data collection. This study explores
   the use of multi-temporal imaging spectroscopy data to increase the
   total mapping area of bare soils in a heterogeneous agricultural
   landscape. Spectrally and spatially high-resolution data from the
   Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) were collected in September 2013, April
   2014 and April 2015. Bare soils in all acquisitions were identified. To
   eliminate short-term differences in soil moisture and soil surface
   roughness, the empirical line method was used to calibrate the
   reflectance values of the singular images (2013 and 2015) towards the
   singular image with most bare soil pixels (2014). Difference indicators
   show that the calibration was successful (decrease in root mean square
   difference and angle difference, increase in R-2 and gain and offset
   close to one and zero). Finally, the multi-temporal composite image
   contained more than double the amount of bare soil pixels as compared to
   a singular acquisition. Summary statistics show that reflectance values
   of the multi-temporal composite approximate the single image data of
   2014 (mean and standard deviation of 2014: 24.2 +/- 8.9 vs. 24.0 +/- 9.5
   for the multi-temporal composite of 2013, 2014 and 2015). This indicates
   that global differences in soil moisture and land management have been
   corrected for. As a result, an improved spatial representation of soil
   parameters can be retrieved from the composite data. Spatial
   distribution of the correction factors and analysis of the spatial
   variability of all images, however, indicate that non-linear, short-term
   differences like variation in soil moisture and land management largely
   influence the result of the multi-temporal composite. Quantification and
   attribution of those factors will be required in the future to allow
   correcting for them.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity to tolerate freezing temperatures limits the geographical
   distribution of many plants, including several species of agricultural
   importance. However, the genes involved in freezing tolerance remain
   largely unknown. Here, we describe the variation in constitutive
   freezing tolerance that occurs among worldwide accessions of Arabidopsis
   thaliana. We found that although plants from high latitudes tend to be
   more freezing tolerant than plants from low latitudes, the environmental
   factors that shape cold adaptation differ across the species range.
   Consistent with this, we found that the genetic architecture of freezing
   tolerance also differs across its range. Conventional genome-wide
   association studies helped identify a priori and other promising
   candidate genes. However, simultaneously modelling climate variables and
   freezing tolerance together pinpointed other excellent a priori
   candidate genes. This suggests that if the selective factor underlying
   phenotypic variation is known, multi-trait mixed models may aid in
   identifying the genes that underlie adaptation.
   The ability to withstand freezing temperatures limits the geographical
   distribution of many plants, but the genes involved remain largely
   unknown. Here, we investigate the genetic bases of freezing tolerance in
   the model system, Arabidopsis thaliana. By using quantitative trait
   locus and genome-wide association studies and data from the 1001 Genomes
   Project, we identified several promising candidate genes. Our results
   suggest that the genetic architecture of freezing tolerance varies
   across the species range. Moreover, we found evidence that the climate
   variables that shape freezing tolerance also vary across the range, and
   that modelling climate variables with freezing tolerance may improve
   power in genome-wide association studies.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary processes such as adaptation, ecological filtering, and
   niche conservatism involve the interaction of organisms with their
   environment and are thus commonly studied along environmental gradients.
   Elevational gradients have become among the most studied environmental
   gradients to understand large-scale patterns of species richness and
   composition because they are highly replicated with different
   combinations of geographical, environmental and historical factors. We
   here review the literature on using elevational gradients to understand
   evolutionary processes in ferns. Some phylogenetic studies of individual
   fern clades have considered elevation in the analysis or interpretation
   and postulated that fern diversification is linked to the colonization
   of mountain habitats. Other studies that have linked elevational
   community composition and hence ecological filtering with phylogenetic
   community composition and morphological traits, usually only found
   limited phylogenetic signal. However, these studies are ultimately only
   correlational, and there are few actual tests of the evolutionary
   mechanisms leading to these patterns. We identify a number of challenges
   for improving our understanding of how evolutionary and ecological
   processes are linked to elevational richness patterns in ferns: i)
   limited information on traits and their ecological relevance, ii)
   uncertainties on the dispersal kernels of ferns and hence the
   delimitation of regional species pools from which local assemblages are
   recruited, iii) limited genomic data to identify candidate genes under
   selection and hence actually document adaptation and selection, and iv)
   conceptual challenges in developing clear and testable hypotheses to how
   specific evolutionary processes can be linked to patterns in community
   composition and species richness.}},

Abstract = {{Species and genetic diversity patterns are predicted to co-vary due to
   similar mechanistic processes. Previous studies assessing species and
   genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs) have focused primarily on local
   diversity patterns or island-like systems and ignore the underlying
   dispersal network. Here we assessed local and regional SGDCs using
   freshwater macroinvertebrates sampled across the Rhine river network, a
   spatially large and highly connected system, in Switzerland. We utilised
   a set of polymorphic microsatellite markers to assess the genetic
   diversity of two amphipod species of the Gammarus fossarum complex,
   which were compared to species level diversities of Amphipoda,
   Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and family level
   macroinvertebrate diversity across 217 randomly selected sites. All
   sites were selected based on a representative and standardised
   species-sampling scheme. We analysed within site (-SGDC) and
   between-site SGDC (-SGDC). Against our expectation, we generally found
   negative or null -SGDCs and -SGDCs. However, we did find genetic
   diversity to be spatially structured, whereas species richness was
   related to local environmental factors. These findings suggest that the
   genetic and species levels of diversity observed are driven by different
   mechanisms (e.g., environment versus demography), or operate across
   different temporal or spatial scales (e.g., colonisation history or
   dendritic river network structure), and may be attributed to differences
   in the species' ecology or life history. Overall, conservation measures
   in riverine systems aiming at only one level of diversity may not
   necessarily benefit other levels of diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Bartonellae cause zoonotic diseases and are transmitted by arthropods.
   Rodents are reservoirs for most Bartonella spp. As the knowledge about
   Bartonella in rodents and their parasitizing ectoparasites is scarce in
   Germany, this study's objectives were to investigate Bartonella spp. in
   small mammals and in their ectoparasites. A total of 79 small mammals
   (seven species) were captured and their ectoparasites collected at seven
   sites around Leipzig, Saxony, Germany, in 2010 and 2011. Altogether, 79
   spleen samples, 135 fleas (five species) and 365 ticks (three species)
   were investigated for Bartonella spp. by PCR targeting the ITS 16S-23S
   rRNA region. In total, 52 (65.8 \%) small mammals, 73 (54.1 \%) fleas
   and 51 (16.3 \%) ticks were positive for Bartonella spp. Most small
   mammals were positive for uncultured Bartonella sp. (n = 29) followed by
   Bartonella grahamii (n= 12), Bartonella taylorii (n= 8) and Bartonella
   sp. N40 (n= 3). Likewise, most fleas were positive for uncultured
   Bartonella sp. (n= 45) followed by B. grahamii (n= 14), B. taylorii (n =
   8), B. sp. N40 (n= 5) and Bartonella elizabethae (n = 2). Most ticks
   were positive for B. sp. (n = 19) followed by B. grahamii (n = 10),
   Bartonella chomelii (n = 3), B. taylorii (n = 2) and B. sp. N40 (n = 1).
   This study's results suggest that rodents and fleas may be reservoirs
   and vectors, respectively. Zoonotic B. grahamii and B. elizabethae were
   found in rodents and their fleas. Therefore, humans may contract
   Bartonella infection by contact to wild rodents. Ticks seem of minor
   importance in transmitting Bartonella spp. found in fleas and rodents.
   However, ticks might be vectors of B. chomelii.}},

Abstract = {{Speculation over a global rise in jellyfish populations has become

   purported global increase' had not been tested. Here we present a
   citation analysis of peer-reviewed literature to track the evolution of
   the current perception of increases in jellyfish and identify key papers
   involved in its establishment. Trend statements and citation threads
   were reviewed and arranged in a citation network. Trend statements were
   assessed according their degree of affirmation and spatial scale, and
   the appropriateness of the citations used to support statements was
   assessed. Analyses showed that 48.9\% of publications misinterpreted the
   conclusions of cited sources, with a bias towards claiming jellyfish
   populations are increasing, with a single review having the most
   influence on the network. Collectively, these disparities resulted in a
   network based on unsubstantiated statements andcitation threads. As a
   community, we must ensure our statements about scientific findings in
   general are accurately substantiated and carefully communicated such
   that incorrect perceptions, as in the case of jellyfish blooms, do not
   develop in the absence of rigorous testing.}},

Abstract = {{Plants with altered intracellular Pi compartmentation surprisingly show
   accelerated dark-induced senescence. We propose that low cytosolic
   phosphate concentrations are of critical importance for proper plant
   development.The phosphate transporter PHT4;6 locates to the trans-Golgi
   compartment, and its impaired activity causes altered intracellular
   phosphate compartmentation, leading to low cytosolic Pi levels, a
   blockage of Golgi-related processes such as protein glycosylation and
   hemicellulose biosynthesis, and a dwarf phenotype. However, it was
   unclear whether altered Pi homeostasis in pht4;6 mutants causes further
   cellular problems, typically associated with limited phosphate
   availability. Here we report that pht4;6 mutants exhibit a markedly
   increased disposition to induce dark-induced senescence. In control
   experiments, in which pht4;6 mutants and wild-type plants developed
   similarly, we confirmed that accelerated dark-induced senescence in
   mutants is not a `pleiotropic' process associated with the dwarf
   phenotype. In fact, accelerated dark-induced senescence in pht4;6
   mutants correlates strongly with increased levels of toxic NH4 (+) and
   higher sensitivity to ammonium, which probably contribute to the
   inability of pht4;6 mutants to recover from dark treatment. Experiments
   with modified levels of either salicylic acid (SA) or trans-zeatin (tZ)
   demonstrate that altered concentrations of these compounds in pht4;6
   plants act as major cellular mediators for dark-induced senescence. This
   conclusion gained further support from the notion that the expression of
   the pht4;6 gene is, in contrast to genes coding for major phosphate
   importers, substantially induced by tZ. Taken together, our findings
   point to a critical function of PHT4;6 to control cellular phosphate
   levels, in particular the cytosolic Pi availability, required to
   energize plant primary metabolism for proper plant development.
   Phosphate and its allocation mediated by PHT4;6 is critical to prevent
   onset of dark-induced senescence.}},

Abstract = {{Echinococcus multilocularis transmission predominantly occurs in Europe
   between the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and various species of rodent
   intermediate hosts. We infected 3 species of rodent, Myodes glareolus (n
   = 47), Mesocricetus auratus (n = 11) and outbred Mus musculus (CD-1 IGS)
   (n = 9) with an E. multilocularis egg suspension that contained 100 eggs
   with viable oncospheres and performed post mortem examination 6, 8 (M.
   glareolus) and 10 weeks post inoculation (wpi). C57BL/6j mice (n = 4)
   were used as positive controls as they have been shown to exhibit
   macroscopic liver lesions 4 wpi. To the best of our knowledge, this is
   the first study to experimentally assess susceptibility in the
   ostensibly competent host M. glareolus. Lesions were only detected in 2
   of 47 M. glareolus (4.3\%) at 8 and 10 wpi and although both contained
   protoscolices (1675 at 8 wpi and 88 at 12 wpi) the low percentage of
   infected animals brings into question their role as transmitters of the
   parasite. Significant differences were observed between inbred and
   outbred mice with E. multilocularis infection in the former
   demonstrating increased establishment (p <= 0.0001) and growth (p <=
   0.0001). No lesions were found in all 11 M. auratus. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Personality in free-living individuals has predominantly been measured
   under standardized laboratory conditions. Such measurements have been
   then linked to life-history traits, fitness and survival. Yet, it
   remains unclear how such personality measurements reflect the variation
   shown by free-living individuals, if the same measurements were taken
   directly in their natural environment. Here, we used free-living African
   striped mice to test whether the personality traits of activity,
   boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when measured in the
   laboratory and in the field contexts. First, we established whether
   personality traits were repeatable and consistent within one context.
   Next, we compared measurements across the two different contexts.
   Additionally, we established whether personality traits were correlated
   with one another in behavioural syndromes and assessed whether the
   resulting syndromes were consistent across the two contexts. All
   personality traits in the laboratory were measured using classical
   personality tests. The same tests were then modified and used to measure
   personality of the same individuals in the field. All personality traits
   were highly repeatable and consistent within the same context. In
   addition, individuals behaved consistently for all the behaviours
   measured both in the laboratory and in the field. Further, we found that
   the presence of two correlated context-specific separate latent
   variables (one for the field and one for the laboratory) underpinned all
   the behaviours measured, indicating that there is a context-specific
   syndrome in this species. Overall, our results confirm that measurements
   of personality traits of wild striped mouse individuals recorded in the
   laboratory environment are consistent with the traits that the same
   individuals show under natural conditions.
   Animal personality research has been mostly focused on measuring traits
   of wild individuals under standardized laboratory conditions. Most
   recently, however, such approaches have come under increased scrutiny as
   it is unclear whether personality measured in the laboratory reflects
   the variation that the same individuals would show if the same
   measurements were taken directly in their natural habitat. Here, we used
   wild African striped mice to test whether the personality traits of
   activity, boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when
   measured in the laboratory and in the field contexts. Using similar
   protocols, we established whether personality traits were repeatable and

   standardized laboratory conditions are consistent with field
   measurements for all personality traits considered.}},

Title = {{Flexible habitat selection paves the way for a recovery of otter
   populations in the European Alps}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{199}},
Pages = {{88-95}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Carnivores are threatened worldwide through habitat loss and
   persecution. Habitat destruction is a major threat for the Eurasian
   otter. Its populations declined drastically in Europe but are now
   expanding again, including into the Alps. Here, flood prevention and
   hydropower have massively altered the riverine landscapes.
   We evaluated the recovery potential of otters by testing the impact of
   major factors of habitat transformation and human disturbance on
   multiple spatial scales. In a hierarchical approach, we investigated
   spatial use and foraging habitat selection of nine otters in a long-term
   radiotracking study in the eastern Central Alps. We combined fine scale
   habitat selection analysis with individual movements by applying a
   step-selection function approach to the linear river system in a novel
   way.
   At home range scale, otters preferred the main riverbeds to abstracted
   water and tributaries, whereas at fine scale, there was no significant
   preference for pristine sections within the watercourses. Otters
   selected for reservoirs in streams with a width smaller than 12 m and
   otherwise preferred foraging in residual waters and stretches with main
   discharge.
   At this stage of recovery, otters show a surprising flexibility in their
   habitat selection. This is promising for the species' future expansion
   into former abandoned areas. However, given that the traditional fish
   stocking regime might contribute to this recovery by providing
   profitable hunting grounds after stocking events, there is an increased
   risk of human-wildlife conflicts. Our results demonstrate a high
   adaptability of a threatened carnivore to altered landscapes and show
   how this flexible behaviour opens opportunities for recovery. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Cushion-forming species occur in all cold and dry environments
   worldwide, where they play important engineering roles. Understanding
   the origins of cushion plants may thus provide insights into the
   evolutionary assembly of biomes under extreme climatic conditions. Here
   we investigate the evolutionary and biogeographic history of cushions in
   Angiosperms based on a global checklist of all cushion plants, along
   with phylogenetic, climatic, and biogeographic information. Our aim is
   to measure the frequency of this evolutionary convergence and to
   identify its historic, environmental, and biogeographic drivers. We show
   that cushions appeared at least 115 times in Angiosperms and that they
   mainly belong to families that occupy the coldest and driest
   environments on Earth. We found that cushions have intensively
   diversified in the Himalayas, the Andes, or New Zealand, while other
   regions like Patagonia have probably been hubs enabling cushion species
   to migrate between different alpine regions. We conclude that the
   cushion life form is a remarkable example of convergent key innovation,
   which has favored the colonization of cold and dry habitats. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are an important force in nature, but the evolutionary
   dynamics of the traits that cause them are not well understood. Egg size
   is known to be a key mediator of prenatal maternal effects with an
   established genetic basis. In contrast to theoretical expectations for
   fitness-related traits, there is a large amount of additive genetic
   variation in egg size observed in natural populations. One possible
   mechanism for the maintenance of this variation is through genetic
   constraints caused by a shared genetic basis among traits. Here we
   created replicated, divergent selection lines for maternal egg
   investment in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) to quantify the role of
   genetic constraints in the evolution of egg size. We found that egg size
   responds rapidly to selection, accompanied by a strong response in all
   egg components. Initially, we observed a correlated response in body
   size, but this response declined over time, showing that egg size and
   body size can evolve independently. Furthermore, no correlated response
   in fecundity (measured as the proportion of days on which a female laid
   an egg) was observed. However, the response to selection was
   asymmetrical, with egg size plateauing after one generation of selection
   in the high but not the low investment lines. We attribute this pattern
   to the presence of genetic asymmetries, caused by directional dominance
   or unequal allele frequencies. Such asymmetries may contribute to the
   evolutionary stasis in egg size observed in natural populations, despite
   a positive association between egg size and fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Losses in coral cover have been widely reported for the Caribbean. In
   contrast, much less is known about the health state of the Brazilian
   reef fauna, which was declared as a priority for Atlantic biodiversity
   conservation due to its high degree of endemism. In the present study,
   we assessed the general health state of Phyllogorgia dilatata
   assemblages at the subtropical reefs of Arraial do Cabo (southeastern
   Brazil), where observations suggest that the abundance of this endemic
   gorgonian species has declined. We found that about 49\% of the sampled
   colonies were dead, and 73\% of the living colonies were affected by
   tissue loss. Tissue loss initially manifested as multifocal holes in the
   planar colonial coenenchyme and peripheral tissue retraction leaving
   denuded skeletal axes. In combination with other recent studies, our
   results raise the awareness for an increasingly threatened Southwestern
   Atlantic reef coral fauna. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown using simulated data that phase estimation of
   cross-track multibaseline synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric
   data was most efficiently achieved through a maximum likelihood (ML)
   method. In this paper, we apply and assess the ML approach on real data,
   acquired with an experimental Ka-band multibaseline system. Compared to
   simulated data, dealing with real data implies that several calibration
   steps be carried out to ensure that the data fit the model. A processing
   chain was, therefore, designed, including steps responsible for
   compensating for imperfections observed in the data, such as beam
   elevation angle dependent phase errors or phase errors caused by
   imperfect motion compensation. The performance of the ML phase
   estimation was evaluated by comparing it to results based on a
   coarse-to-fine (C2F) algorithm, where information from the shorter
   baselines was used only to unwrap the phase from the longest available
   baseline. For this purpose, flat areas with high coherence and
   homogeneous texture were selected in the acquired data. The results show
   that with only four looks, the noise level was marginally better with
   the C2F approach and contained fewer outliers. However, with more looks,
   the ML method consistently delivered better results: noise variance with
   the C2F approach was slightly but steadily larger than the variance
   obtained with ML method.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of preservation have allowed environmental conditions at
   numerous localities in space and time to be inferred. However, in the
   search for sufficient vertebrate specimens to provide a large dataset,
   details of specimen taxonomy, geographic origin and stratigraphic level
   are often ignored or not collected. Any preservational variation
   identified as a result is therefore from a broad range rather than a
   specific group, locality or time. The effect of this limitation, mainly
   regarding the loss of crucial information on environmental processes in
   ancient settings and the biology of long extinct organisms, is
   demonstrated using specimens of Ichthyopterygia (Reptilia). Taphonomic
   analysis of a dataset of 173 specimens infers a consistent reduction of
   skeletal condition from peripheral to medial within a carcass and a
   taphonomic pathway involving minimal floating and prolonged residence on
   the sediment surface. The same dataset divided into three sub-datasets,
   from the Middle Triassic Besano Formation, Lower Jurassic Blue Lias
   Formation and Lower Jurassic Posidonia Shale Formation, highlight
   preservational variation, in the extent of loss of articulation and
   completeness that follows an environmental gradient related to proximity
   to major landmasses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{EXCEPTIONAL SKULL OF HUAYQUERIANA (MAMMALIA, LITOPTERNA,

Abstract = {{The Huayquerias Formation (Late Miocene, Huayquerian SALMA) is broadly
   exposed in west-central Argentina (Mendoza). The target of several major
   paleontological expeditions in the first half of the 20th century, the
   Mendozan Huayquerias ({''}badlands{''}) have recently yielded a
   significant number of new fossil finds. In this contribution we describe
   a complete skull (IANIGLA-PV 29) and place it systematically as
   Huayqueriana cf. H. cristata (Rovereto, 1914) (Litopterna,
   Macraucheniidae). The specimen shares some nonexclusive features with H.
   cristata (similar size, rostral border of the orbit almost level with
   distal border of M3, convergence of maxillary bones at the level of the
   P3/P4 embrasure, flat snout, very protruding orbits, round outline of
   premaxillary area in palatal view, and small diastemata between I3/C and
   C/P1). Other differences (e.g., lack of sagittal crest) may or may not
   represent intraspecific variation. In addition to other features
   described here, endocast reconstruction utilizing computer tomography
   (CT) revealed the presence of a derived position of the orbitotemporal
   canal running below the rhinal fissure along the lateroventral aspect of
   the piriform lobe. CT scanning also established that the maxillary nerve
   (CN V-2) leaves the skull through the sphenoorbital fissure, as in all
   other litopterns, a point previously contested for macraucheniids. The
   angle between the lateral semicircular canal and the plane of the base
   of the skull is about 26 degrees, indicating that in life the head was
   oriented much as in modern horses. Depending on the variables used,
   estimates of the body mass of IANIGLA-PV 29 produced somewhat
   conflicting results. Our preferred body mass estimate is 250 kg, based
   on the centroid size of 36 3D cranial landmarks and accompanying low
   prediction error. The advanced degree of tooth wear in IANIGLA-PV 29
   implies that the individual died well into old age. However, a count of
   cementum lines on the sectioned left M2 is consistent with an age at
   death of 10 or 11 years, younger than expected given its body mass. This
   suggests that the animal had a very abrasive diet. Phylogenetic analysis
   failed to resolve the position of IANIGLA-PV 29 satisfactorily, a result
   possibly influenced by intraspecific variation. There is no decisive
   evidence for the proposition that Huayqueriana, or any other litoptern,
   were foregut fermenters.}},

Abstract = {{A significant number of countries classified as ``developing{''} during
   the negotiation of the UNFCCC in the early 1990s have experienced rapid
   economic growth and increase of greenhouse gas emissions since then. We
   assess whether governments of such countries are considering taking up
   responsibility for emissions mitigation in the context of the UNFCCC's
   principle of common but differentiated responsibility (CBDR). While an
   expansion of mitigation responsibility to Non-Annex I countries has been
   strongly opposed by overarching groups such as the G 77, we find
   countries such as South Africa and Indonesia that have clearly supported
   binding commitments. Other countries like China and Singapore oppose
   binding commitments but increasingly engage in domestic mitigation
   action. Moreover, China has pledged a significant amount of climate
   finance. Even in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which
   adamantly refuse mitigation commitments, some mitigation action seems to
   emerge. We thus foresee that countries will increasingly adopt
   differentiated positions regarding their responsibility for mitigation.
   This could provide new dynamics in international climate negotiations.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation plans can be greatly improved when information on the
   evolutionary and demographic consequences of habitat fragmentation is
   available for several codistributed species. Here, we study spatial
   patterns of phenotypic and genetic variation among five grasshopper
   species that are codistributed across a network of microreserves but
   show remarkable differences in dispersal-related morphology (body size
   and wing length), degree of habitat specialization and extent of
   fragmentation of their respective habitats in the study region. In
   particular, we tested the hypothesis that species with preferences for
   highly fragmented microhabitats show stronger genetic and phenotypic
   structure than codistributed generalist taxa inhabiting a continuous
   matrix of suitable habitat. We also hypothesized a higher resemblance of
   spatial patterns of genetic and phenotypic variability among species
   that have experienced a higher degree of habitat fragmentation due to
   their more similar responses to the parallel large-scale destruction of
   their natural habitats. In partial agreement with our first hypothesis,
   we found that genetic structure, but not phenotypic differentiation, was
   higher in species linked to highly fragmented habitats. We did not find
   support for congruent patterns of phenotypic and genetic variability
   among any studied species, indicating that they show idiosyncratic
   evolutionary trajectories and distinctive demographic responses to
   habitat fragmentation across a common landscape. This suggests that
   conservation practices in networks of protected areas require detailed
   ecological and evolutionary information on target species to focus
   management efforts on those taxa that are more sensitive to the effects
   of habitat fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Collective action on climate change is easier when the involved actors
   share an understanding of climate justice, that is, if they agree on the
   morally right way of dealing with the issue. Such understandings have
   been shown to vary, however. Based on German, Indian and US media
   coverage, we develop a typology of different constructions of climate
   justice. The five patterns we identify differ considerably across
   several dimensions, including the valuation of certain goods and rights,
   the definition of moral in-groups, and the basic principles for climate
   governance. These patterns can be found in all three countries, but
   their importance varies between them. The US debate is especially
   conflictive, with some actors emphasizing freedom from state
   intervention and others demanding provident political action. Although
   the positions in Germany and India are less divergent, there is also no
   agreement on how to address climate change in a just way in these
   countries. In particular, the conflict between global and
   intergenerational justice demands - reflecting the nature of climate
   change - and the enduring relevance of traditional conceptions focusing
   on contemporary and national communities are intricate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper suggests a way to elaborate the ethical implications of the
   Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) as decided at COP 19 from the
   perspective of justice. It advocates three proposals. First, in order to
   fully understand the responsibilities and liabilities implied in the
   WIM, adaptation needs to be distinguished from loss and damage (L\&D) on
   the basis of the different goals which should be attributed to
   adaptation and to L\&D approaches. Second, the primary concern of the
   WIM should be compensatory justice. In case of climate L\&D, three
   aspects of compensatory justice should be kept separate: corrective
   liability, remedial responsibility, and with regard to the resources
   available, fair remedy. Third, it is crucial to distinguish between
   recoverable damage and irrecoverable or at least not fully recoverable
   loss. This distinction is crucial because it informs the principles of
   fair remedy and because damage and loss may differ in their relevance
   for the stability and functioning of a human system.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic influences on resources and consumers can affect food web
   regulation, with impacts on trophic structure and ecosystem processes.
   Identifying how these impacts unfold is challenging because alterations
   to one or both resources and consumers can similarly transform community
   structure, especially for intermediate consumers. To date, empirical
   testing of perturbations on trophic regulation has been limited by the
   difficulty in separating the direct effect of perturbations on species
   composition and diversity from those unfolding indirectly via altered
   feeding pathways. Moreover, disentangling the independent and
   interactive impacts of co-varying stressors that characterize
   human-altered systems has been an ongoing analytical challenge. We used
   a large-scale metacommunity experiment in grasslands to test how
   resource inputs, stand perturbation, and spatial factors affect
   regulation of insect herbivores in tritrophic grassland food webs. Using
   path-model comparisons, we observed significant simplification of food
   web regulation on insect herbivores, shifting from mixed
   predator-resource regulation in un-altered mainland areas to strictly
   resource-based regulation with landscape perturbation and fragmentation.
   Most changes were attributed to homogenization of plant community caused
   by landscape fragmentation and the deterministic influence of
   eutrophication that reduced among-patch beta diversity. This led to a
   simplified food web dominated by fewer but more abundant herbivore taxa.
   Our work implies that anthropogenic perturbation relating to resources
   and spatial isolation can transform the regulation of food web
   diversity, structure, and function.}},

Abstract = {{Inbreeding avoidance among interacting females and males is not always
   observed despite inbreeding depression in offspring fitness, creating an
   apparent ``inbreeding paradox.{''} This paradox could be resolved if
   selection against inbreeding was in fact weak, despite inbreeding
   depression. However, the net magnitude and direction of selection on the
   degree to which females and males inbreed by pairing with relatives has
   not been explicitly estimated. We used long-term pedigree data to
   estimate phenotypic selection gradients on the degree of inbreeding that
   female and male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) expressed by forming
   socially persistent breeding pairs with relatives. Fitness was measured
   as the total numbers of offspring and grand offspring contributed to the
   population, and as corresponding expected numbers of
   identical-by-descent allele copies, thereby accounting for variation in
   offspring survival, reproduction, and relatedness associated with
   variation in parental inbreeding. Estimated selection gradients on the
   degree to which individuals paired with relatives were weakly positive
   in females, but negative in males that formed at least one socially
   persistent pairing. However, males that paired had higher mean fitness
   than males that remained socially unpaired. These analyses suggest that
   net selection against inbreeding may be weak in both sexes despite
   strong inbreeding depression, thereby resolving the ``inbreeding
   paradox.{''}}},

Abstract = {{Determining which drivers lead to a specific species assemblage is a
   central issue in community ecology. Although many processes are
   involved, plant-plant interactions are among the most important. The
   phylogenetic limiting similarity hypothesis states that closely related
   species tend to compete stronger than distantly related species,
   although evidence is inconclusive. We used ecological and phylogenetic
   data on alpine plant communities along an environmental severity
   gradient to assess the importance of phylogenetic relatedness in
   affecting the interaction between cushion plants and the whole
   community, and how these interactions may affect community assemblage
   and diversity. We first measured species richness and individual biomass
   of species growing within and outside the nurse cushion species,
   Arenaria tetraquetra. We then assembled the phylogenetic tree of species
   present in both communities and calculated the phylogenetic distance
   between the cushion species and its beneficiary species, as well as the
   phylogenetic community structure. We also estimated changes in species
   richness at the local level due to the presence of cushions. The effects
   of cushions on closely related species changed from negative to positive
   as environmental conditions became more severe, while the interaction
   with distantly related species did not change along the environmental
   gradient. Overall, we found an environmental context-dependence in
   patterns of phylogenetic similarity, as the interaction outcome between
   nurses and their close and distantly-related species showed an opposite
   pattern with environmental severity.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{170}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Pastoralist tribal communities inhabit
   Thakht-e-Sulaiman hills since centuries. In this remote and
   geographically isolated area, local people mainly rely on their natural
   environment for ethnoveterinary care. The area is therefore of special
   interest for the documentation and analysis of ethnoveterinary plant use
   and efficacy.
   Materials and methods: Field work was conducted from 2010-2012 and 86
   informants were interviewed. First, detailed unstructured interviews and
   group discussions were done with key informants, and second, successive
   oral freelisting and semi-structured interviews were performed. The
   veterinary diseases as described by the informants were categorized
   according to the symptoms they cause and the organs they affect.
   Information on the cited plants, informant consensus factor (ICF) and
   fidelity level (FL) were calculated based on use reports.
   Results: A total of 22 ethnoveterinary medicinal plant species,
   belonging to 21 genera and 20 families with 559 use reports were
   recorded from two different ecological zones. More species were
   documented from the foothills but total use reports were higher for
   mountain species. Mainly leaves are used to prepare decoctions which are
   administered orally. Most use reports concerned skeleto-muscular
   problems followed by gastrointestinal ailments, but ritual uses and
   dermatological illnesses got highest ICF. Most often cited species were
   Pinus gerardina, P. wallichiana and Daphne papyracea while highest FL
   was obtained for Salix tetrasperma, Berberis calliobotrys and Litsea
   monopetala. Interestingly, 50\% of the species have the same or similar
   use for humans.
   Conclusion: According to the local people, the most often mentioned
   species have high medicinal potential. They show a wide acceptance,
   broad application, multiple ways of preparation and administration.
   There is a need to conserve the knowledge of medicinal plant use in the
   Thakht-e-Sulaiman hills for future generations and to incorporate it
   into existing livestock health care services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland

   In humans, the most prevalent ESBL enzyme type is encoded by
   bla(CTX-M-15). CTX-M-15 producing enterobacterial strains were also
   frequently isolated from environmental samples including surface water
   and freshwater fish. Plasmids, which can be grouped in different plasmid
   incompatibility types, play a key role in the horizontal spread of these
   multidrug resistance genes. The purpose of this study was to investigate
   the diversity of plasmids that carry blaCTX-M-15 genes among
   Enterobacteriaceae isolated at the environment, livestock and human
   interface.
   In total, 81 bla(CTX-M-15)-harboring isolates collected between 2009 and
   2014 were tested for its ability to transfer bla(CTX-M-15) by
   conjugation. These plasmids were further typed. Transfer of a single
   bla(CTX-M-15)-harboring plasmid was observed in 32 (39.5\%) of the
   isolates. The most frequent replicon types detected among these plasmids
   are IncF-type plasmids (n = 12) (mostly multi replicon plasmids with a
   combination of following replicons: IncFII, IncFIA and IncFIB), followed
   by IncI1 (n = 8), IncK (n = 3) and IncR (n = 1). A noticeable number of
   plasmids (n = 8) could not be assigned to any of the tested replicon
   types.
   Knowledge about the plasmid types circulating in bacterial populations
   is indispensable for understanding epidemiological dynamics and for
   establishing intervention strategies to stop further dissemination of
   particular plasmids. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bees, spiders, earthworms and plants contribute considerably to
   biodiversity in grasslands and fulfil vital ecological functions. They
   also provide valuable services to agriculture, such as pollination, pest
   control and maintenance of soil quality. We investigated the responses
   of wild bees, spiders, earthworms and plants to geographic location,
   agricultural management and surrounding landscape variables using a
   dataset of 357 grassland fields within 88 farms in six European regions.
   Regions and taxonomic groups were selected to have contrasting
   properties, in order to capture the multiple facets of European
   grasslands. Geographic location alone had a dominant effect on the fauna
   and flora communities. Depending on the taxonomic group, various
   agricultural management and surrounding landscape variables alone had an
   additional significant effect on observed species richness, rarefied
   species richness and/or abundance, but it was always small. Bee species
   richness and abundance decreased with increasing number of mechanical
   operations (e.g. cutting). Observed spider species richness and
   abundance were unrelated to measured aspects of agricultural management
   or to surrounding landscape variables, whereas rarefied species richness
   showed significant relations to nitrogen input, habitat diversity and
   amount of grassland habitats in the surroundings. Earthworm abundance
   increased with increasing nitrogen input but earthworm species richness
   did not. Observed plant species richness decreased with increasing
   nitrogen input and increased when there were woody habitats in the
   surroundings. Rarefied plant species richness decreased with mechanical
   operations. Investigating multiple regions, taxonomic groups and aspects
   of fauna and flora communities allowed identifying the main factors
   structuring communities, which is necessary for designing appropriate
   conservation measures and ensuring continued supply of services.}},

Title = {{The causes of southern African spatial patterns in species richness:
   speciation, extinction and dispersal in the Danthonioideae (Poaceae)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Aim Four factors (time, dispersal, extinction and speciation) shape the
   differences in species richness within a clade between two regions. The
   southern African summer-rainfall Highveld' is less species rich than the
   adjacent winter-rainfall Greater Cape Floristic Region'. In many clades,
   this may be the result of a Cape origin of these temperate clades, with
   later dispersal to the cool uplands of the Highveld. We explored an
   alternative scenario of a widespread southern African Miocene temperate
   flora, which survived in the Cape. We used these four factors to seek
   the more likely scenario for the Danthonioideae.
   Location Southern Africa.
   Methods We used a rate-corrected and dated phylogeny including 118 of
   134 species of African Danthonioideae (Poaceae), and assigned the
   species to be either winter rainfall (Cape) or summer rainfall
   (Highveld). We inferred speciation and extinction rates using TreePar
   and bamm for the whole clade and also for each rainfall regime,
   transition direction using BayesTraits and Lagrange, and integrated
   speciation-extinction-migration using BiSSE.
   Results We found no differences in the speciation rates between the two
   areas, and no clear indication of the ancestral area of the clade.
   However, one of the most likely BiSSE models found a lower extinction
   rate in the Cape, and another found a higher transition rate from summer
   rainfall to winter rainfall.
   Main conclusions We found more support for the scenario of a southern
   African rather than a Cape origin of the danthonioids. The winter
   rainfall Cape became differentiated from the rest of southern Africa in
   the late Miocene. Late Miocene extinction, possibly driven by the
   expansion of C-4 grasses, may have decimated the Highveld lineages,
   whereas the Cape lineages continued to diversify. Exploring some other
   Cape clades may reveal more instances of the Cape acting as a museum' of
   southern African temperate diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebrates obtain most of their energy through food, which they store
   mainly as body fat or glycogen, with glucose being the main energy
   source circulating in the blood. Basal blood glucose concentration
   (bBGC) is expected to remain in a narrow homeostatic range. We studied
   the extent to which bBGC in free-living African striped mice (Rhabdomys
   pumilio) is influenced by ecological factors with a bearing on energy
   regulation, i.e. food availability, abiotic environmental variation and
   social tactic. Striped mice typically form extended family groups that
   huddle together at night, reducing energetic costs of thermoregulation,
   but solitary individuals also occur in the population. We analysed 2827
   blood samples from 1008 individuals of seven different social categories
   that experienced considerable variation in food supply and abiotic
   condition. Blood samples were taken from mice in the morning after the
   overnight fast and before foraging. bBGC increased significantly with
   food plant abundance and decreased significantly with minimum daily
   ambient temperature. Solitary striped mice had significantly higher bBGC
   than group-living striped mice. Our results suggest that adaptive
   responses of bBGC occur and we found large natural variation, indicating
   that bBGC spans a far greater homeostatic range than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of food webs suggest that limited nonrandom dispersal can play
   an important role in structuring food webs. It is not clear, however,
   whether density-dependent dispersal fits empirical patterns of food webs
   better than density-independent dispersal. Here, we study a spatially
   distributed food web, using a series of population-dispersal models that
   contrast density-independent and density-dependent dispersal in
   landscapes where sampled sites are either homogeneously or
   heterogeneously distributed. These models are fitted to empirical data,
   allowing us to infer mechanisms that are consistent with the data. Our
   results show that models with density-dependent dispersal fit the , ,
   and tritrophic richness observed in empirical data best. Our results
   also show that density-dependent dispersal leads to a critical distance
   threshold beyond which site similarity (i.e., tritrophic richness)
   starts to decrease much faster. Such a threshold can also be detected in
   the empirical data. In contrast, models with density-independent
   dispersal do not predict such a threshold. Moreover, preferential
   dispersal from more centrally located sites to peripheral sites does not
   provide a better fit to empirical data when compared with symmetric
   dispersal between sites. Our results suggest that nonrandom dispersal in
   heterogeneous landscapes is an important driver that shapes local and
   regional richness (i.e., and tritrophic richness, respectively) as well
   as the distance-decay relationship (i.e., tritrophic richness) in food
   webs.}},

Title = {{Glacier-specific elevation changes in parts of western Alaska}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{70}},
Pages = {{184-192}},
Abstract = {{The meltwater from glaciers in Alaska contributes strongly to global
   sea-level rise, but accurate determination is challenging as only two
   comparatively small glaciers have long-term measurements of annual mass
   balance (Gulkana and Wolverine). Simple upscaling of their values to the
   entire region is error-prone as their representativeness is unknown and
   might be biased. Alternatively, differencing digital elevation models
   (DEMs) from two epochs provides overall volume changes for a longer
   period of time that can be converted to mass changes using appropriate
   density assumptions. Here we combine outlines from two glacier
   inventories to determine glacier-specific elevation changes over a 50
   year period for 3180 glaciers in western Alaska using DEM differencing.
   This allows us to determine the representativeness of the
   land-terminating Gulkana and Wolverine Glaciers for the entire region
   and to exclude calving glaciers (marine and lacustrine) from the sample.
   Mean changes for all land-terminating, lake-terminating and tidewater
   glaciers are -0.23 +/- 0.44, -0.63 +/- 0.40 and -0.64 +/- 0.66 m a(-1),
   respectively, and -0.7 and -0.6 m a(-1) for the two mass-balance or
   benchmark glaciers. Thus fortuitously their changes better represent
   calving glaciers and the overall mean (-0.63 +/- 1.14 m a(-1)) than the
   change of land-terminating glaciers, i.e. they are not representative
   for their own type. Different methods of considering potential DEM

Title = {{The `island effect' in terrestrial global change experiments: a problem
   with no solution?}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Most of the currently experienced global environmental changes (rising
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations, warming, altered amount and pattern of
   precipitation, and increased nutrient load) directly or indirectly
   affect ecosystem surface energy balance and plant transpiration. As a
   consequence, the relative humidity of the air surrounding the vegetation
   changes, thus creating a feedback loop whose net effect on transpiration
   and finally productivity is not trivial to quantify. Forcedly, in any
   global change experiment with the above drivers, we can only treat small
   plots, or `islands', of vegetation. This means that the treated plots
   will likely experience the ambient humidity conditions influenced by the
   surrounding, non-treated vegetation. Experimental assessments of global
   change effects will thus systematically lack modifications originating
   from these potentially important feedback mechanisms, introducing a bias
   of unknown magnitude in all measurements of processes directly or
   indirectly depending on plant transpiration. We call this potential bias
   the `island effect'. Here, we discuss its implications in various global
   change experiments with plants. We also suggest ways to complement
   experiments using modelling approaches and observational studies.
   Ultimately, there is no obvious solution to deal with the island effect
   in field experiments and only models can provide an estimate of
   modification of responses by these feedbacks. However, we suggest that
   increasing the awareness of the island effect among both experimental
   researchers and modellers will greatly improve the interpretation of
   vegetation responses to global change.}},

Title = {{Foraging ecology of three sympatric ungulate species - Behavioural and
   resource maps indicate differences between chamois, ibex and red deer}},
Journal = {{MOVEMENT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Background: The spatial distribution of forage resources is a major
   driver of animal movement patterns. Understanding where animals forage
   is important for the conservation of multi-species communities, since
   interspecific competition can emerge if different species use the same
   depletable resources. However, determining forage resources in a
   spatially continuous fashion in alpine grasslands at high spatial
   resolution was challenging up to now, because terrain heterogeneity
   causes vegetation characteristics to vary at small spatial scales, and
   methods for detection of behavioural phases in animal movement patterns
   were not widely available. We delineated areas coupled to the foraging
   behaviour of three sympatric ungulate species (chamois, ibex, red deer)
   using Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH), a non-parametric utilisation
   distribution method incorporating spatial and temporal autocorrelation
   structure of GPS data. We used resource maps of plant biomass and plant
   nitrogen content derived from high-resolution airborne imaging
   spectroscopy data, and multinomial logistic regression to compare the
   foraging areas of the three ungulate species.
   Results: We found significant differences in plant biomass and plant
   nitrogen content between the core foraging areas of chamois, ibex and
   red deer. Core foraging areas of chamois were characterised by low plant
   biomass and low to medium plant nitrogen content. Core foraging areas of
   ibex were, in contrast, characterised by high plant nitrogen content,
   but varied in plant biomass, and core foraging areas of red deer had
   high plant biomass, but varied in plant nitrogen content.
   Conclusions: Previous studies carried out in the same study area found
   no difference in forage consumed by chamois, ibex and red deer.
   Methodologically, those studies were based on micro-histological
   analysis of plant fragments identifying them to plant family or
   functional type level. However, vegetation properties such as
   productivity (biomass) or plant nutrient content can vary within
   vegetation communities, especially in highly heterogeneous landscapes.
   Thus, the combination of high spatial resolution resource maps with a
   utilisation distribution method allowing to generate behavioural maps
   (T-LoCoH) provides new insights into the foraging ecology of the three
   sympatric species, important for their conservation and to monitor
   expected future changes.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Divergent selection by pollinators can bring about strong reproductive
   isolation via changes at few genes of large effect. This has recently
   been demonstrated in sexually deceptive orchids, where studies (1)
   quantified the strength of reproductive isolation in the field; (2)
   identified genes that appear to be causal for reproductive isolation;
   and (3) demonstrated selection by analysis of natural variation in gene
   sequence and expression. In a group of closely related Ophrys orchids,
   specific floral scent components, namely n-alkenes, are the key floral
   traits that control specific pollinator attraction by chemical mimicry
   of insect sex pheromones. The genetic basis of species-specific
   differences in alkene production mainly lies in two biosynthetic genes
   encoding stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturases (SAD) that are
   associated with floral scent variation and reproductive isolation
   between closely related species, and evolve under pollinator-mediated
   selection. However, the implications of this genetic architecture of key
   floral traits on the evolutionary processes of pollinator adaptation and
   speciation in this plant group remain unclear. Here, we expand on these
   recent findings to model scenarios of adaptive evolutionary change at
   SAD2 and SAD5, their effects on plant fitness (i.e., offspring number),
   and the dynamics of speciation. Our model suggests that the two-locus
   architecture of reproductive isolation allows for rapid sympatric
   speciation by pollinator shift; however, the likelihood of such
   pollinator-mediated speciation is asymmetric between the two orchid
   species O.sphegodes and O.exaltata due to different fitness effects of
   their predominant SAD2 and SAD5 alleles. Our study not only provides
   insight into pollinator adaptation and speciation mechanisms of sexually
   deceptive orchids but also demonstrates the power of applying a modeling
   approach to the study of pollinator-driven ecological speciation.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{3420-3434}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Island populations are on average smaller, genetically less diverse, and
   at a higher risk to go extinct than mainland populations. Low genetic
   diversity may elevate extinction probability, but the genetic component
   of the risk can be affected by the mode of diversity loss, which, in
   turn, is connected to the demographic history of the population. Here,
   we examined the history of genetic erosion in three Fennoscandian ringed
   seal subspecies, of which one inhabits the Baltic Sea `mainland' and two
   the `aquatic islands' composed of Lake Saimaa in Finland and Lake Ladoga
   in Russia. Both lakes were colonized by marine seals after their
   formation c. 9500 years ago, but Lake Ladoga is larger and more
   contiguous than Lake Saimaa. All three populations suffered dramatic
   declines during the 20th century, but the bottleneck was particularly
   severe in Lake Saimaa. Data from 17 microsatellite loci and
   mitochondrial control-region sequences show that Saimaa ringed seals
   have lost most of the genetic diversity present in their Baltic
   ancestors, while the Ladoga population has experienced only minor
   reductions. Using Approximate Bayesian computing analyses, we show that
   the genetic uniformity of the Saimaa subspecies derives from an extended
   founder event and subsequent slow erosion, rather than from the recent
   bottleneck. This suggests that the population has persisted for nearly
   10,000 years despite having low genetic variation. The relatively high
   diversity of the Ladoga population appears to result from a high number
   of initial colonizers and a high post-colonization population size, but
   possibly also by a shorter isolation period and/or occasional gene flow
   from the Baltic Sea.}},

Abstract = {{Variation of the intraruminal papillation pattern with diet quality has

   measures as a proxy for habitat quality and nutritional status of
   animals has not been evaluated. We compared various measures of body
   condition (body mass, body condition score, kidney fat index, bone
   marrow fat index, adrenal mass, kidney to adrenal mass ratio), diet
   quality (\%browse, protein and fibre content) and rumen papillation in
   106 impalas (Aepyceros melampus) from four different locations in
   Zimbabwe. The various condition proxies indicated that periods of low
   diet quality are characterised by a high proportion of browse in the
   diet of this species. Animals with a high proportion of browse had more
   voluminous rumens, suggesting a compensation for lower diet quality by
   increased intake. Macroscopic papillation indices did not yield
   meaningful significant correlations with diet quality or body condition
   proxies, and hence, their use for estimating habitat or body condition
   cannot be advocated. In contrast to previous histological reports,
   ballooning cells of the Stratum corneum of the ruminal mucosa were more
   prominent in animals on lower-quality diets. There were significant
   correlations of the kidney to adrenal mass ratio with other body
   conditions and with diet quality indices, suggesting that poor body

Abstract = {{The Pm3 gene confers resistance against wheat powdery mildew. Studies of
   Pm3 diversity have shown that Pm3 alleles isolated from southern
   populations of wild emmer wheat located in Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and
   Syria are more diverse and more distant from bread wheat alleles than
   alleles from the northern wild wheat populations located in Turkey,
   Iran, and Iraq. Therefore, southern populations from Israel were studied
   extensively to reveal novel Pm3 alleles that are absent from the
   cultivated gene pool. Candidate Pm3 genes were isolated via a polymerase
   chain reaction cloning approach. Known and newly identified Pm3 genes
   were subjected to variation analysis and polymorphic amino acid residues
   were superimposed on a three-dimensional (3D) model of PM3. The region
   of highest interspecies diversity between Triticum aestivum and T.
   dicoccoides lies in leucine-rich repeats (LRR) 19 to 24, whereas most
   intraspecies diversity in T. aestivum is located in LRR 25 to 28.
   Interestingly, these two regions are separated by one large LRR whose
   propensity for flexibility facilitates the conformation of the PM3 LRR
   domain into two differently structured models. The combination of
   evolutionary and protein 3D structure analysis revealed that Pm3 genes
   in wild and domesticated wheat show different evolutionary histories
   which might have been triggered through different interactions with the
   powdery mildew pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{The monospecific Phycolepidoziaceae with the single neotropical species
   Phycolepidozia exigua is a highly specialized leafy liverwort without
   vegetative leaves. The extreme reduction of morphological and anatomical
   characters of Phycolepidozia has caused uncertainties as to the
   systematic position of the genus and family. In 2012, a second species
   of Phycolepidozia was detected in the Western Ghats, South India. The
   Indian plant differs from P. exigua in several respects and is described
   here as P. (subg. Metaphycolepidozia) indica Gradst., J.-P.Frahm \&
   U.Schwarz. Differences include the massive stem of P. indica, the larger
   perianth with a crenate, 3-lobed mouth, and the epidermis of the capsule
   wall made up of non-tiered cells with nodular thickenings on both
   longitudinal and transverse walls. A phylogenetic analysis using four
   different chloroplast regions (psbA, psbT, rps4, rbcL) of P. indica and
   putatively related groups shows that Phycolepidozia is nested within the
   leafy liverwort family Cephaloziellaceae. Consequently,
   Phycolepidoziaceae is placed in the synonymy of Cephaloziellaceae. The
   discovery of P. indica adds a further example to the list of
   amphi-Pacific tropical disjunctions in bryophytes.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{We studied tree height in stands of high-Andean Polylepis forests in two
   cordilleras near Cuzco (Peru) with respect to variations in human impact
   and climatic conditions, and compared air and soil temperatures between
   qualitatively defined dry and humid slopes. We studied 46 forest plots
   of 100 m(2) of five Polylepis species at 3560-4680 m. We measured
   diameter at breast height (dbh) and tree height in the stands (1229
   trees in total), as well as air and soil temperatures in a subset of
   plots. The data was analyzed combining plots of given species from
   different sites at the same elevation (+/- 100 m). There was no
   elevational decrease of mean maximum tree height across the entire data
   set. On humid slopes, tree height decreased continuously with elevation,
   whereas on dry slopes it peaked at middle elevations. With mean maximum
   tree heights of 9 m at 4530 m on the humid slopes and of 13 m at 4650 m
   on the dry slopes, we here document the tallest high-elevation forests
   found so far worldwide. These highest stands grow under cold mean
   growing season air temperatures (3.6 and 3.8 degrees C on humid vs. dry
   slopes) and mean growing season soil temperatures (5.1 vs. 4.6 degrees
   C). Mean annual air and soil temperature both decreased with elevation.
   Dry slopes had higher mean and maximum growing season air temperatures
   than humid slopes. Mean annual soil temperatures did not significantly
   differ and mean annual air temperatures only slightly differed between
   slopes. However, maximum air temperatures differed on average by 6.6 K
   between dry and humid slopes. This suggests that the differences in tree
   height between the two slopes are most likely due to differences in
   solar radiation as reflected by maximum air temperatures. Our study
   furthermore provides evidence that alpine Polylepis treelines grow under
   lower temperature conditions than global high-elevation treelines on
   average, suggesting that Polylepis species may have evolved special
   physiological adaptations to low temperatures.}},

Journal = {{TAXON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Molecular and morphological evolution of species may be decoupled which
   can lead to contrasting delimitation of taxonomic units based on
   morphological and genetic characters. The moss genus Sphagnum (peat
   mosses) provides a good example in which morphological and genetic
   characters often contradict each other. We investigated morphological
   and genetic variability within a highly polymorphic and taxonomically
   controversial species complex of the genus Sphagnum in order to reveal
   the ultimate causes of discordance between morphology and molecular
   evolution. Specifically, we aimed at addressing the following questions:
   (1) Are the three closely related European taxa (S. angustifolium, S.
   fallax, S. flexuosum) of the S. recurvum group morphologically and
   genetically distinct entities? (2) Are morphological and genetic groups
   concordant? (3) Is there any sign of hybridization among taxa that might
   complicate their morphological delimitation? We show that European
   specimens of the S. recurvum group form three distinct gene pools based
   on 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Individuals defined as
   morphotype ``fallax{''} appear to be genetically clearly distinct from
   both morphotype ``angustifolium{''} and ``flexuosum{''}. However, for
   the latter two morphotypes, traditionally used morphological and genetic
   markers provide partly incongruent taxonomic delimitations. We show that
   in about 13\% of the accessions 12 traditionally used morphological
   characters cannot fully distinguish the genetic groups revealed. Our
   genetic analysis also reveals that only a low proportion of the
   specimens (3\%) is admixed suggesting that hybridization is unlikely to
   explain the taxonomical controversies observed. Therefore, we
   hypothesize that taxonomic controversies are likely due to the extreme
   phenotypic plasticity of morphological characters rather than to porous
   species boundaries.}},

Title = {{Expression of TWISTED DWARF1 lacking its in-plane membrane anchor leads

Journal = {{PLANT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Plant growth is achieved predominantly by cellular elongation, which is
   thought to be controlled on several levels by apoplastic auxin. Auxin
   export into the apoplast is achieved by plasma membrane efflux catalysts
   of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) and ATP-binding cassette protein subfamily
   B/phosphor-glycoprotein (ABCB/PGP) classes; the latter were shown to
   depend on interaction with the FKBP42, TWISTED DWARF1 (TWD1). Here by
   using a transgenic approach in combination with phenotypical,
   biochemical and cell biological analyses we demonstrate the importance
   of a putative C-terminal in-plane membrane anchor of TWD1 in the
   regulation of ABCB-mediated auxin transport. In contrast with dwarfed
   twd1 loss-of-function alleles, TWD1 gain-of-function lines that lack a
   putative in-plane membrane anchor (HA-TWD1-C-t) show hypermorphic plant
   architecture, characterized by enhanced stem length and leaf surface but
   reduced shoot branching. Greater hypocotyl length is the result of
   enhanced cell elongation that correlates with reduced polar auxin
   transport capacity for HA-TWD1-C-t. As a consequence, HA-TWD1-C-t
   displays higher hypocotyl auxin accumulation, which is shown to result
   in elevated auxin-induced cell elongation rates. Our data highlight the
   importance of C-terminal membrane anchoring for TWD1 action, which is
   required for specific regulation of ABCB-mediated auxin transport. These
   data support a model in which TWD1 controls lateral ABCB1-mediated
   export into the apoplast, which is required for auxin-mediated cell
   elongation.}},

Abstract = {{Humans engage in wayfinding many times a day. We try to find our way in
   urban environments when walking towards our work places or when visiting
   a city as tourists. In order to reach the targeted destination, we have
   to make a series of wayfinding decisions of varying complexity. Previous
   research has focused on classifying the complexity of these wayfinding
   decisions, primarily looking at the complexity of the decision point
   itself (e.g., the number of possible routes or branches). In this paper,
   we proceed one step further by incorporating the user, instructions, and
   environmental factors into a model that assesses the complexity of a
   wayfinding decision. We constructed and evaluated three models using
   data collected from an outdoor wayfinding study. Our results suggest
   that additional factors approximate the complexity of a wayfinding
   decision better than the simple model using only the number of branches
   as a criterion.}},

Title = {{Exploring the potential of luminescence methods for dating Alpine rock
   glaciers}},
Journal = {{QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{17-33}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rock glaciers contain valuable information about the spatial and
   temporal distribution of permafrost. The wide distribution of these
   landforms in high mountains promotes them as useful archives for the
   deciphering of the environmental conditions during their formation and
   evolution. However, age constraints are needed to unravel the
   palaeoclimatic context of rock glaciers, but numerical dating is
   difficult. Here, we present a case study assessing the potential of
   luminescence techniques (OSL, IRSL) to date the inner sand-rich layer of
   active rock glaciers. We focus on the signal properties and the
   resetting of the signal prior to deposition by investigating single
   grains. While most quartz shows low signal intensities and problematic
   luminescence characteristics, K-feldspar exhibits much brighter and
   well-performing signals. Most signals from plagioclases do not show
   suitable properties. Luminescence signals far below saturation indicate
   distinct but differential bleaching. The finite mixture model was used
   to determine the prominent populations in the equivalent dose
   distributions. The luminescence ages represent travel times of grains
   since incorporation into the rock glacier and hence, minimum ages of
   rock glacier formation. Luminescence ages between 3 ka and 8 ka for
   three rock glaciers from the Upper Engadine and Albula region (Swiss
   Alps) agree well with independent age estimates from relative and
   semi-quantitative approaches. Therefore, luminescence seems to have the
   potential of revealing age constraints about processes related to the
   formation of rock glaciers, but further investigations are required for
   solving some of the problems remaining and reducing the dating
   uncertainties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied group I introns in sterile cultures of selected groups of
   lichen photobionts, focusing on Trebouxia species associated with
   Xanthoria s. lat. (including Xanthomendoza spp.; lichen-forming
   ascomycetes). Group I introns were found inserted after position 798
   (Escherichia coli numbering) in the large subunit (LSU) rRNA in
   representatives of the green algal genera Trebouxia and Asterochloris.
   The 798 intron was found in about 25\% of Xanthoria photobionts
   including several reference strains obtained from algal culture
   collections. An alignment of LSU-encoded rDNA intron sequences revealed
   high similarity of these sequences allowing their phylogenetic analysis.
   The 798 group I intron phylogeny was largely congruent with a phylogeny
   of the internal transcribed spacer region, indicating that the insertion
   of the intron most likely occurred in the common ancestor of the genera
   Trebouxia and Asterochloris. The intron was vertically inherited in some
   taxa, but lost in others. The high-sequence similarity of this intron to
   one found in Chlorella angustoellipsoidea suggests that the 798 intron
   was either present in the common ancestor of Trebouxiophyceae, or that
   its present distribution results from more recent horizontal transfers,
   followed by vertical inheritance and loss. Analysis of another group I
   intron shared by these photobionts at small subunit position 1512
   supports the hypothesis of repeated lateral transfers of this intron
   among some taxa, but loss among others. Our data confirm that the
   history of group I introns is characterized by repeated horizontal
   transfers, and suggests that some of these introns have ancient origins
   within Chlorophyta.}},

Title = {{The developmental plasticity and functional significance of an
   additional sperm storage compartment in female yellow dung flies}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1392-1402}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. The mechanistic basis for and adaptive significance of variation in
   female sperm storage organs are important for a range of questions
   concerning sexual selection and speciation, as such variation influences
   the evolutionary trajectories of male fertilization related traits and
   may facilitate speciation through its effects on gamete recognition.
   2. Female yellow dung flies (Scathophaga stercoraria) usually develop
   three sperm storage compartments, and this subdivision may be an
   adaptation for sorting sperm during postcopulatory choice.
   3. Using lines artificially selected to express four spermathecae (4s),
   we explored the fitness consequences of the novel phenotype relative to
   the naturally prevalent three-spermatheca (3s) phenotype by manipulating
   the opportunity for postcopulatory sexual selection (females mated
   either with three or only one male prior to oviposition). In addition,
   we examined the developmental plasticity of spermathecal number in
   response to different larval food environments and estimated its genetic
   correlation with growth rate.
   4. Mating treatments with and without the opportunity for postcopulatory
   sexual selection revealed no significant fitness differences between
   alternative spermathecal phenotypes within selection lines despite
   overall benefits associated with multiple mating, and moderate
   egg-to-adult survival costs in response to artificial selection for 4s.
   Manipulations of the larval food environment revealed that the
   expression of 4s is highly plastic and tightly linked to environmental
   conditions promoting fast somatic growth and development. Likewise,
   siblings with fast intrinsic (genetic) growth were more likely to
   express 4s within and across food environments.
   5. The present results highlight a great potential for rapid
   evolutionary change in female sperm storage morphology through indirect
   selection on life-history traits, and further suggest genetic
   assimilation as a potential mechanism facilitating phylogenetic
   transitions in spermatheca number as frequently observed within the
   Dipterans.}},

Title = {{Jumpstarting post-conflict strategic water resources protection from a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{244-259}},

Abstract = {{Notwithstanding ambiguities, long-term economic resurgence in
   Afghanistan amidst water insecurity exacerbated by climate change
   decisively requires a water protection strategy that will complement a
   multitude of agroindustrial and socioeconomic activities in an
   environmentally sustainable and climate resilient manner. In this paper,
   we begin with a perspective on institutions, legislation, and key issues
   in the water sector of Afghanistan. We then embark on linking the
   integrated water resources management (IWRM) and strategic environmental
   assessment (SEA) approaches as a novel framework for strategic water
   management and subsequently propose a strategy for post-conflict water
   protection based on the coalesced IWRM and SEA. Context relevant good
   practices worldwide are presented to provide empirical evidence for this
   approach whereas perceived opportunities and vulnerabilities in the
   Afghan context are discussed. Examination of post-conflict water sector
   initiatives in Afghanistan reveals the critical role of foreign
   assistance in both water infrastructure rehabilitation and modernization
   of the institutional aspect of water management. The introduction of
   IWRM as the basis for a progressive water sector strategy has been seen
   as a major milestone which is detrimentally matched by substantial
   deficiency in national capacity for implementation. Concurrently, the
   role of extra-national actors in relevant policy interventions has been
   considered catalytic despite criticisms of proposed regulations as being
   anachronistic to field realities. Therefore the view is maintained to
   practicable policies by accelerating policy learning in the country's
   water and environment sectors to encourage homegrown water strategy
   innovations. Demonstratively, mainstreaming IWRM-SEA coalescence will
   bridge institutional gaps for better feedback between local and national
   water stakeholders, providing a venue for improved delivery of water
   services to sustain post-conflict socioeconomic recovery and promote
   environmental stewardship. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic diversity is crucial for long-term population persistence.
   Population loss and subsequent reduction in migration rate among the
   most important processes that are expected to lead to a reduction in
   genetic diversity and an increase in genetic differentiation. While the
   theory behind this is well-developed, empirical evidence from wild
   populations is inconsistent. Using microsatellite markers, we compared
   the genetic structure of populations of an amphibian species, the
   midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans), in four Swiss regions where the
   species has suffered variable levels of subpopulation extirpation. We
   also quantified the effects of several geographic factors on genetic
   structure and used a model selection approach to ascertain which of the
   variables were important for explaining genetic variation. Although
   subpopulation pairwise F-ST-values were highly significant even over
   small geographic scales, neither any of the geographic variables nor
   loss of subpopulations were important factors for predicting spatial
   genetic structure. The absence of a signature of subpopulation loss on
   genetic differentiation may suggest that midwife toad subpopulations
   function as relatively independent units.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{280}},
Number = {{1765}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Social monitoring of the actions of group members is thought to be a key
   development associated with group living. Humans constantly monitor the
   behaviour of others and respond to them in a flexible way depending on
   past interactions and the current social context. While other primates
   have also been reported to change their behaviour towards other group
   members flexibly based on the current state of their relationship,
   empirical evidence is typically linked to contextually specific events
   such as aggressive or reproductive interactions. In the cooperatively
   breeding meerkat (Suricata suricatta), we investigated whether
   subordinate females use frequently emitted, non-agonistic close calls to
   monitor the location of the dominant female and whether they
   subsequently adjust their response based on recent social interactions
   during conflict and non-conflict periods. Subjects discriminated between
   the close calls of the dominant female and control playbacks, responding
   by approaching the loudspeaker and displaying submissive behaviour only
   if they were currently threatened by eviction. Our results suggest that
   meerkats assess the risk for aggressive interactions with close
   associates depending on social circumstances, and respond accordingly.
   We argue that social monitoring based on non-agonistic cues is probably
   a common mechanism in group-living species that allows the adjustment of
   behaviour depending on variation in relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: Efficacy and safety of willow bark extract for pain
   reduction in patients suffering from musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) has
   been shown in clinical short term trials. Therefore this observational
   study over 6 months should evaluate patterns of treatments like mono- or
   combinations therapy, dosage and safety during long-term treatment under
   pragmatic conditions with the aqueous willow bark extract STW 33-I,
   (Proaktiv (R); drug-extract-ratio 16-23:1).
   Patients and methods: The patients were treated with STW 33-I;
   comedication with other NSAIDs and opioids was allowed. An extensive
   case report form including pain questionnaires and patient diary was
   used for outcome evaluation.
   Results: Four hundred and thirty-six patients with rheumatic pain mainly
   due to osteoarthritis (56.2\%) and back pain (59.9\%) were included.
   During the study the mean reductions from baseline value 58.4 +/-
   22.6-31.8 +/- 22.5 after 24 weeks in the pain intensity scale (VAS 0-100
   mm) were significant even after 3 weeks with a reduction by 26 mm
   (45.6\% of the baseline value) at the end of the study. The relative
   reductions of the weekly means of the daily patient self-rated scores of
   the pain (6-point Likert-scales) were between 33\% and 44\% of the
   baseline values during the course of the study. We present results of
   subgroups according their analgetic/antiphlogistic comedication.
   The distribution and specification of the main adverse events and the
   ratings of the treatment showed a good tolerability. No relevant drug
   interactions were reported.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that STW 33-I can be used as a basic
   treatment in the long-term therapy of painful musculoskeletal disorders
   and that it can be combined with NSAIDs and opioids if necessary. (C)

Abstract = {{This article presents a framework for estimating a new topographic
   attribute derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) called maximum
   branch length (B-max). Branch length is defined as the distance
   travelled along a flow path initiated at one grid cell to the confluence
   with the flow path passing through a second cell. B-max is the longest
   branch length measured for a grid cell and its eight neighbours. The
   index provides a physically meaningful method for assessing the relative
   significance of drainage divides to the dispersion of materials and
   energy across a landscape, that is, it is a measure of divide size'.
   B-max is particularly useful for studying divide network structure, for
   mapping drainage divides, and in landform classification applications.
   Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of
   estimates of B-max to the algorithm used to estimate flow lengths and
   the prevalence of edge effects resulting from inadequate DEM extent. The
   findings suggest that the index is insensitive to the specific flow
   algorithm used but that edge effects can result in significant
   underestimation along major divides. Edge contamination can, however, be
   avoided by using an appropriately extensive DEM.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{161-172}},

Abstract = {{Flowering time is a well-studied subject in ecology, evolution and
   molecular biology. Long-term phenological studies have shown
   relationships between flowering time and environmental and endogenous
   factors in many species. In contrast, molecular studies using model
   plants have revealed a complex regulatory network of flowering. We
   propose that flowering would be a model trait for the integrated study
   of ecology, evolution and molecular biology. We introduce briefly the
   flowering regulatory pathways of Arabidopsis thaliana, followed by
   molecular techniques such as transgenic manipulation, quantitative
   real-time PCR and detection of differentially expressed genes that could
   facilitate the study of `nonmodel' species of ecological interest but
   with little available genome information. Application of the flowering
   gene network to wild species will be illustrated by two examples:
   modeling and prediction of the expression of flowering genes in
   Arabidopsis halleri, and the latitudinal cline of bud set and cessation
   in Populus. Finally, we discuss the challenges in integrating knowledge
   of the regulatory network on flowering into ecologically unique
   flowering phenomena such as synchronous intermittent mass flowering-the
   topic of this special issue.}},

Title = {{Decision-making for mitigating wildlife diseases: From theory to
   practice for an emerging fungal pathogen of amphibians}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1987-1996}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Conservation science can be most effective in its decision-support
   role when seeking answers to clearly formulated questions of direct
   management relevance. Emerging wildlife diseases, a driver of global
   biodiversity loss, illustrate the challenges of performing this role: in
   spite of considerable research, successful disease mitigation is
   uncommon. Decision analysis is increasingly advocated to guide
   mitigation planning, but its application remains rare.
   2. Using an integral projection model, we explored potential mitigation
   actions for avoiding population declines and the ongoing spatial spread
   of the fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). This fungus has
   recently caused severe amphibian declines in north-western Europe and
   currently threatens Palearctic salamander diversity.
   3. Available evidence suggests that a Bsal outbreak in a fire salamander
   (Salamandra salamandra) population will lead to its rapid extirpation.
   Treatments such as anti-fungals or probiotics would need to effectively
   interrupt transmission (reduce probability of infection by nearly 90\%)
   in order to reduce the risk of host extirpation and successfully
   eradicate the pathogen.
   4. Improving the survival of infected hosts is most likely to be
   detrimental as it increases the potential for pathogen transmission and
   spread. Active removal of a large proportion of the host population has
   some potential to locally eradicate Bsal and interrupt its spread,
   depending on the presence of Bsal reservoirs and on the host's spatial
   dynamics, which should therefore represent research priorities.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Mitigation of Batrachochytrium
   salamandrivorans epidemics in susceptible host species is highly
   challenging, requiring effective interruption of transmission and
   radical removal of host individuals. More generally, our study
   illustrates the advantages of framing conservation science directly in
   the management decision context, rather than adapting to it a
   posteriori.}},

Abstract = {{Changing high-mountain environments are characterized by destabilizing
   ice, rock or debris slopes connected to evolving glacial lakes. Such
   configurations may lead to potentially devastating sequences of mass
   movements (process chains or cascades). Computer simulations are
   supposed to assist in anticipating the possible consequences of such
   phenomena in order to reduce the losses. The present study explores the
   potential of the novel computational tool r.avaflow for simulating
   complex process chains. r.avaflow employs an enhanced version of the
   Pudasaini (2012) general two-phase mass flow model, allowing
   consideration of the interactions between solid and fluid components of
   the flow. We back-calculate an event that occurred in 2012 when a
   landslide from a moraine slope triggered a multi-lake outburst flood in
   the Artizon and Santa Cruz valleys, Cordillera Blanca, Peru, involving
   four lakes and a substantial amount of entrained debris along the path.
   The documented and reconstructed flow patterns are reproduced in a
   largely satisfactory way in the sense of empirical adequacy. However,
   small variations in the uncertain parameters can fundamentally influence
   the behaviour of the process chain through threshold effects and
   positive feedbacks. Forward simulations of possible future cascading
   events will rely on more comprehensive case and parameter studies, but
   particularly on the development of appropriate strategies for
   decision-making based on uncertain simulation results. (c) 2017 The

Abstract = {{Biodiversity loss decreases ecosystem functioning at the local scales at
   which species interact, but it remains unclear how biodiversity loss
   affects ecosystem functioning at the larger scales of space and time
   that are most relevant to biodiversity conservation and policy. Theory
   predicts that additional insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem
   functioning could emerge across time and space if species respond
   asynchronously to environmental variation and if species become
   increasingly dominant when and where they are most productive. Even if
   only a few dominant species maintain ecosystem functioning within a
   particular time and place, ecosystem functioning may be enhanced by many
   different species across many times and places (beta-diversity). Here,
   we develop and apply a new approach to estimate these previously
   unquantified insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning
   that arise due to species turnover across times and places. In a
   long-term (18-year) grassland plant diversity experiment, we find that
   total insurance effects are positive in sign and substantial in
   magnitude, amounting to 19\% of the net biodiversity effect, mostly due
   to temporal insurance effects. Species loss can therefore reduce
   ecosystem functioning both locally and by eliminating species that would
   otherwise enhance ecosystem functioning across temporally fluctuating
   and spatially heterogeneous environments.}},

Abstract = {{Palaeoproteomics is an emerging neologism used to describe the
   application of mass spectrometry-based approaches to the study of
   ancient proteomes. As with palaeogenomics (the study of ancient DNA), it
   intersects evolutionary biology, archaeology and anthropology, with
   applications ranging from the phylogenetic reconstruction of extinct
   species to the investigation of past human diets and ancient diseases.
   However, there is no explicit consensus at present regarding standards
   for data reporting, data validation measures or the use of suitable
   contamination controls in ancient protein studies. Additionally, in
   contrast to the ancient DNA community, no consolidated guidelines have
   been proposed by which researchers, reviewers and editors can evaluate
   palaeoproteomics data, in part due to the novelty of the field. Here we
   present a series of precautions and standards for ancient protein
   research that can be implemented at each stage of analysis, from sample
   selection to data interpretation. These guidelines are not intended to
   impose a narrow or rigid list of authentication criteria, but rather to
   support good practices in the field and to ensure the generation of
   robust, reproducible results. As the field grows and methodologies
   change, so too will best practices. It is therefore essential that
   researchers continue to provide necessary details on how data were
   generated and authenticated so that the results can be independently and
   effectively evaluated. We hope that these proposed standards of practice
   will help to provide a firm foundation for the establishment of
   palaeoproteomics as a viable and powerful tool for archaeologists,
   anthropologists and evolutionary biologists.}},

Abstract = {{Global change affects ecosystem functioning both directly by

   multifunctionality). We manipulated small natural freshwater ecosystems
   to investigate how warming and top predator loss affect seven ecosystem
   functions representing two major dimensions of ecosystem functioning,
   productivity and metabolism. We investigated their direct and indirect
   effects on community diversity and standing stock of multitrophic macro
   and microorganisms. Warming directly increased multifunctional ecosystem
   productivity and metabolism. In contrast, top predator loss indirectly
   affected multifunctional ecosystem productivity via changes in the
   diversity of detritivorous macroinvertebrates, but did not affect
   ecosystem metabolism. In addition to demonstrating how multiple
   anthropogenic drivers have different impacts, via different pathways, on
   ecosystem multifunctionality components, our work should further spur
   advances in predicting responses of ecosystems to multiple simultaneous

Abstract = {{Eco-evolutionary dynamics are now recognized to be highly relevant for
   population and community dynamics. However, the impact of evolutionary
   dynamics on spatial patterns, such as the occurrence of classical
   metapopulation dynamics, is less well appreciated. Here, we analyse the
   evolutionary consequences of spatial network connectivity and topology
   for dispersal strategies and quantify the eco-evolutionary feedback in
   terms of altered classical metapopulation dynamics. We find that network
   properties, such as topology and connectivity, lead to predictable
   spatio-temporal correlations in fitness expectations. These
   spatio-temporally stable fitness patterns heavily impact evolutionarily
   stable dispersal strategies and lead to eco-evolutionary feedbacks on
   landscape level metrics, such as the number of occupied patches, the
   number of extinctions and recolonizations as well as metapopulation
   extinction risk and genetic structure. Our model predicts that classical
   metapopulation dynamics are more likely to occur in dendritic networks,
   and especially in riverine systems, compared to other types of landscape
   configurations. As it remains debated whether classical metapopulation
   dynamics are likely to occur in nature at all, our work provides an
   important conceptual advance for understanding the occurrence of
   classical metapopulation dynamics which has implications for
   conservation and management of spatially structured populations.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to monitor changes in biodiversity, and their societal
   impact, is critical to conserving species and managing ecosystems. While
   emerging technologies increase the breadth and reach of data
   acquisition, monitoring efforts are still spatially and temporally
   fragmented, and taxonomically biased. Appropriate long-term information
   remains therefore limited. The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity
   Observation Network (GEO BON) aims to provide a general framework for
   biodiversity monitoring to support decision-makers. Here, we discuss the
   coordinated observing system adopted by GEO BON, and review challenges
   and advances in its implementation, focusing on two interconnected core
   components - the Essential Biodiversity Variables as a standard
   framework for biodiversity monitoring, and the Biodiversity Observation
   Networks that support harmonized observation systems - while
   highlighting their societal relevance.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological networks are tightly interconnected, such that loss of a
   single species can trigger additional species extinctions. Theory
   predicts that such secondary extinctions are driven primarily by loss of
   species from intermediate or basal trophic levels. In contrast, most
   cases of secondary extinctions from natural systems have been attributed
   to loss of entire top trophic levels. Here, we show that loss of single
   predator species in isolation can, irrespective of their identity or the
   presence of other predators, trigger rapid secondary extinction cascades
   in natural communities far exceeding those generally predicted by
   theory. In contrast, we did not find any secondary extinctions caused by
   intermediate consumer loss. A food web model of our experimental
   system-a marine rocky shore community-could reproduce these results only
   when biologically likely and plausible nontrophic interactions, based on
   competition for space and predator-avoidance behaviour, were included.
   These findings call for a reassessment of the scale and nature of
   extinction cascades, particularly the inclusion of nontrophic
   interactions, in forecasts of the future of biodiversity.}},

Title = {{How uncertainty analysis of streamflow data can reduce costs and promote

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Streamflow data are used for important environmental and economic
   decisions, such as specifying and regulating minimum flows, managing
   water supplies, and planning for flood hazards. Despite significant
   uncertainty in most flow data, the flow series for these applications
   are often communicated and used without uncertainty information. In this
   commentary, we argue that proper analysis of uncertainty in river flow
   data can reduce costs and promote robust conclusions in water management
   applications. We substantiate our argument by providing case studies
   from Norway and New Zealand where streamflow uncertainty analysis has
   uncovered economic costs in the hydropower industry, improved public
   acceptance of a controversial water management policy, and tested the
   accuracy of water quality trends. We discuss the need for practical
   uncertainty assessment tools that generate multiple flow series
   realizations rather than simple error bounds. Although examples of such
   tools are in development, considerable barriers for uncertainty analysis
   and communication still exist for practitioners, and future research
   must aim to provide easier access and usability of uncertainty
   estimates. We conclude that flow uncertainty analysis is critical for
   good water management decisions.
   Plain Language Summary In this commentary, we show how analyzing
   uncertainty in river flow data can reduce costs and promote robust
   conclusions in water management applications. River flow data can

   Zealand where flow uncertainty analysis has uncovered economic costs in

Title = {{Consistent increase in herbivory along two experimental plant diversity
   gradients over multiple years}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Research on the functional importance of biodiversity, motivated by
   global species loss, has documented that plant species richness affects
   many plant-related ecosystem functions. Less is known about the effects
   of plant species richness on functions related to higher trophic levels,
   such as the consumption of biomass by animals, that is, herbivory.
   Previous studies have shown positive, neutral, or negative effects of
   plant species richness on herbivory. In the framework of a grassland
   biodiversity experiment (the Jena Experiment), we investigated herbivory
   (the proportion of leaf area damaged and the amount of leaf biomass
   consumed by arthropod herbivores) along two experimental gradients of
   plant species richness ranging from 1 to 60 species (Main Experiment)
   and from 1 to 8 species (Trait-Based Experiment) biannually for five and
   three years, respectively. Additionally, plant functional diversity,
   based on traits related to plant growth, was manipulated as the number
   of functional groups in a community (Main Experiment) or a gradient of
   functional trait dissimilarity (Trait-Based Experiment). Herbivory at
   the level of plant communities ranged from 0\% to 31\% (0 and 33.8
   g/m(2)) in the Main Experiment and 0\% to 8\% (0 and 13.7 g/m(2)) in the
   Trait-Based Experiment, and it was on average higher in summer than in
   spring. For both experimental gradients and all years investigated, we
   found a consistent increase in damaged leaf area and consumed biomass
   with increasing plant species richness. As mechanistic explanations for
   effects of plant species richness, we propose changes in plant quality
   and herbivore communities. The presence of specific plant functional
   groups significantly affected herbivory, likely related to traits
   affecting plant defense and nutritional value, but we found little
   evidence for effects of plant functional diversity. The general positive
   relationship between plant species richness and herbivory might
   contribute to effects of plant species richness on other ecosystem
   functions such as productivity and nutrient mineralization and can
   cascade up the food web also affecting higher trophic levels.}},

Title = {{The Lr34 adult plant rust resistance gene provides seedling resistance

Abstract = {{The hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) adult plant resistance gene,
   Lr34/Yr18/Sr57/Pm38/Ltn1, provides broad-spectrum resistance to wheat
   leaf rust (Lr34), stripe rust (Yr18), stem rust (Sr57) and powdery
   mildew (Pm38) pathogens, and has remained effective in wheat crops for
   many decades. The partial resistance provided by this gene is only
   apparent in adult plants and not effective in field-grown seedlings.
   Lr34 also causes leaf tip necrosis (Ltn1) in mature adult plant leaves
   when grown under field conditions. This D genome-encoded bread wheat
   gene was transferred to tetraploid durum wheat (T. turgidum) cultivar
   Stewart by transformation. Transgenic durum lines were produced with
   elevated gene expression levels when compared with the endogenous
   hexaploid gene. Unlike nontransgenic hexaploid and durum control lines,
   these transgenic plants showed robust seedling resistance to pathogens
   causing wheat leaf rust, stripe rust and powdery mildew disease. The
   effectiveness of seedling resistance against each pathogen correlated
   with the level of transgene expression. No evidence of accelerated leaf
   necrosis or up-regulation of senescence gene markers was apparent in
   these seedlings, suggesting senescence is not required for Lr34
   resistance, although leaf tip necrosis occurred in mature plant flag
   leaves. Several abiotic stress-response genes were up-regulated in these
   seedlings in the absence of rust infection as previously observed in
   adult plant flag leaves of hexaploid wheat. Increasing day length
   significantly increased Lr34 seedling resistance. These data demonstrate
   that expression of a highly durable, broad-spectrum adult plant
   resistance gene can be modified to provide seedling resistance in durum
   wheat.}},

Abstract = {{How do organisms arrive on isolated islands, and how do insular
   evolutionary radiations arise? In a recent paper, Wilme etal. () argue
   that early Austronesians that colonized Madagascar from Southeast Asia
   translocated giant tortoises to islands in the western Indian Ocean. In
   the Mascarene Islands, moreover, the human-translocated tortoises then
   evolved and radiated in an endemic genus (Cylindraspis). Their proposal
   ignores the broad, established understanding of the processes leading to
   the formation of native island biotas, including endemic radiations. We
   find Wilme etal.'s suggestion poorly conceived, using a flawed
   methodology and missing two critical pieces of information: the timing
   and the specifics of proposed translocations. In response, we here
   summarize the arguments that could be used to defend the natural origin
   not only of Indian Ocean giant tortoises but also of scores of insular
   endemic radiations world-wide. Reinforcing a generalist's objection, the
   phylogenetic and ecological data on giant tortoises, and current
   knowledge of environmental and palaeogeographical history of the Indian
   Ocean, make Wilme etal.'s argument even more unlikely.}},

Title = {{An experimental test of the habitat-amount hypothesis for saproxylic
   beetles in a forested region}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1613-1622}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The habitat-amount hypothesis challenges traditional concepts that
   explain species richness within habitats, such as the habitat-patch
   hypothesis, where species number is a function of patch size and patch
   isolation. It posits that effects of patch size and patch isolation are
   driven by effects of sample area, and thus that the number of species at
   a site is basically a function of the total habitat amount surrounding
   this site. We tested the habitat-amount hypothesis for saproxylic
   beetles and their habitat of dead wood by using an experiment comprising
   190 plots with manipulated patch sizes situated in a forested region
   with a high variation in habitat amount (i.e., density of dead trees in
   the surrounding landscape). Although dead wood is a spatio-temporally
   dynamic habitat, saproxylic insects have life cycles shorter than the
   time needed for habitat turnover and they closely track their resource.
   Patch size was manipulated by adding various amounts of downed dead wood
   to the plots (similar to 800 m(3) in total); dead trees in the
   surrounding landscape (similar to 240 km(2)) were identified using
   airborne laser scanning (light detection and ranging). Over 3 yr, 477
   saproxylic species (101,416 individuals) were recorded. Considering
   20-1,000 m radii around the patches, local landscapes were identified as
   having a radius of 40-120 m. Both patch size and habitat amount in the
   local landscapes independently affected species numbers without a
   significant interaction effect, hence refuting the island effect.
   Species accumulation curves relative to cumulative patch size were not
   consistent with either the habitat-patch hypothesis or the
   habitat-amount hypothesis: several small dead-wood patches held more
   species than a single large patch with an amount of dead wood equal to
   the sum of that of the small patches. Our results indicate that
   conservation of saproxylic beetles in forested regions should primarily
   focus on increasing the overall amount of dead wood without considering
   its spatial arrangement. This means dead wood should be added wherever
   possible including in local landscapes with low or high dead-wood
   amounts. For species that have disappeared from most forests owing to
   anthropogenic habitat degradation, this should, however, be complemented
   by specific conservation measures pursued within their extant
   distributional ranges.}},

Volume = {{126}},

Abstract = {{The concept of life-history traits and the study of these traits are the
   hallmark of population biology. Acknowledging their variability and
   evolution has allowed us to understand how species adapt in response to
   their environment. The same traits are also involved in how species
   alter ecosystems and shape their dynamics and functioning. Some
   theories, such as the metabolic theory of ecology, ecological
   stoichiometry or pace-of-life theory, already recognize this junction,
   but only do so in an implicitly non-spatial context. Meanwhile, for a
   decade now, it has been argued that ecosystem properties have to be
   understood at a larger scale using meta-ecosystem theory because
   source-sink dynamics, community assembly and ecosystem stability are all
   modified by spatial structure. Here, we argue that some ecosystem
   properties can be linked to a single life-history trait, dispersal, i.e.
   the tendency of organisms to live, compete and reproduce away from their
   birth place. By articulating recent theoretical and empirical studies
   linking ecosystem functioning and dynamics to species dispersal, we aim
   to highlight both the known connections between life-history traits and
   ecosystem properties and the unknown areas, which deserve further
   empirical and theoretical developments.}},

Abstract = {{Arable weeds are among those groups of plants that are most threatened
   in Europe due to management intensification and efficient cleaning of
   crop seeds in modern agriculture. Plant species loss in arable fields
   had been assessed in many European countries about 30 years ago, and has
   gained renewed interest during the last few years. A rich historical
   data set on plots where arable weeds had historically been recorded in
   Switzerland enabled the study of changes in arable weed species since
   the 1920s onward. In total, 232 locations with historical plots were
   revisited. There, we recorded all plant species and their abundances on
   100m(2) plots. Across all plots the average number of species per plot
   declined dramatically by more than 60\% during the last 90 years. Most
   species decreased in frequency, but common species stayed more frequent,
   while rare species often characteristic weeds of traditionally managed
   crop fields decreased in frequency or even disappeared. Plant groups
   with increasing species numbers and frequency were mostly neophytes,
   grasses and species with high nutrient demand. The above mentioned
   decline in species number and frequency of rare and characteristic weed
   species suggests that more effective conservation measures than hitherto
   taken are needed to ensure their preservation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Understanding divergent adaptation and ecological speciation requires
   the synthesis of multiple approaches, including phenotypic
   characterization, genetics and genomics, realistic assessment of fitness
   and population genetic modelling. Current research in this field often
   approaches this problem from one of two directions: either a mechanistic
   approach-seeking to link phenotype, genotype and fitness, or a genomic
   approach - searching for signatures of divergence or selection across
   the genome. In most cases, these two approaches are not synthesized, and
   as a result, our understanding is incomplete. We argue that research in
   adaptation and evolutionary genetics needs to integrate these approaches
   for multiple reasons, including progress towards understanding the
   architecture and evolutionary history of adaptation and speciation loci,
   the ability to untangle linkage and pleiotropy, increased knowledge of
   mechanisms of genomic evolution and insights into parallel evolutionary
   events. Identifying the genetic under-pinnings of adaptation and
   ecological speciation is not necessarily the end goal of research, but
   it is an integral part of understanding the evolutionary process. As a
   result, it is critical to utilize both genetic and genomic approaches.
   Challenges remain, particularly in nonmodel organisms and in our ability
   to synthesize results from multiple experimental systems. Nonetheless,
   advances in genetic and genomic techniques are increasingly available in
   a diverse array of systems, and the time is ripe to exploit the
   synthesis of these two approaches to increase our understanding of
   evolution.}},

   benefit from witnessing knowledgeable adults mobbing their principal
   predator, the goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). Siberian jays live in family
   groups of two to six individuals that also can include unrelated
   nonbreeders. Field observations showed that Siberian jays encounter
   predators only rarely, and, indeed, naive juveniles do not respond to
   predator models when on their own but do when observing other
   individuals mobbing them. Predator exposure experiments demonstrated
   that naive juveniles had a substantially higher first-winter survival
   after observing knowledgeable group members mobbing a goshawk model,
   increasing their likelihood of acquiring a breeding position later in
   life. Previous research showed that naive individuals may learn from
   others how to respond to predators, care for offspring, or choose mates,
   generally assuming that social learning has long-term fitness
   consequences without empirical evidence. Our results demonstrate a
   long-term fitness benefit of vertical social learning for naive
   individuals in the wild, emphasizing its evolutionary importance in
   animals, including humans.}},

Abstract = {{Ground surface temperatures (GST) are widely measured in mountain
   permafrost areas, but their time series data can be interrupted by gaps.
   Gaps complicate the calculation of aggregates and indices required for
   analysing temporal and spatial variability between loggers and sites. We
   present an algorithm to estimate daily mean GST and the resulting
   uncertainty. The algorithm is designed to automatically fill data gaps
   in a database of several tens to hundreds of time series, for example,
   the Swiss Permafrost Monitoring Network (PERMOS). Using numerous
   randomly generated artificial gaps, we validated the performance of the
   gap-filling routine in terms of (1) the bias resulting on annual means,
   (2) thawing and freezing degree-days, and (3) the accuracy of the
   uncertainty estimation. Although quantile mapping provided the most
   reliable gap-filling approach overall, linear interpolation between
   neighbouring values performed equally well for gap durations of up to
   3-5 days. Finding the most similar regressors is crucial and also the
   main source of errors, particularly because of the large spatial and
   temporal variability of ground and snow properties in high-mountain
   terrains. Applying the gap-filling technique to the PERMOS GST data
   increased the total number of complete hydrological years available for
   analysis by 70 per cent (>450-filled gaps), likely without exceeding a
   maximal uncertainty of +/- 0.25 degrees C in calculated annual mean
   values. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Disentangling evolutionary, plastic and demographic processes underlying
   trait dynamics: a review of four frameworks}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{75-85}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Biologists are increasingly interested in decomposing trait dynamics
   into underlying processes, such as evolution, plasticity and demography.
   Four important frameworks that allow for such a decomposition are the
   quantitative genetic animal model (AM), the Geber' method (GM), the
   age-structured Price equation(APE) and the integral projection model
   (IPM). However, as these frameworks have largely been developed
   independently, they differ in the assumptions they make, the data they
   require, as well as their outcomes and interpretation. Here, we evaluate
   how each framework decomposes trait dynamics into underlying processes.
   To do so, we apply them to simulated data for a hypothetical animal
   population. Individual body size was affected by, among others, genes,
   maternal effects and food intake. We simulated scenarios with and
   without selection on body size and with high and low heritability. The
   APE and IPM provided similar results, as did the AM and GM, with
   important differences between the former and the latter. All frameworks
   detected positive contributions of selection in the high but not in the
   low selection scenarios. However, only the AM and GM distinguished
   between the high and low heritability scenarios. Furthermore, the AM and
   GM revealed a high contribution of plasticity. The APE and IPM
   attributed most of the change in body size to ontogenetic growth and
   inheritance, where the latter captures the combined effects of
   plasticity, maternal effects and heritability. We show how these
   apparent discrepancies are mostly due to differences in aims and
   definitions. For example, the APE and IPM capture selection, whereas the
   AM and GM focus on the response to selection. Furthermore, the
   frameworks differ in the processes that are ascribed to plasticity and
   in how they take into account demography. We conclude that no single
   framework provides the true' contributions of evolution, plasticity and
   demography. Instead, different research questions require different
   frameworks. A thorough understanding of the different definitions of
   their components is necessary for selecting the most appropriate
   framework for the question at hand and for making biologically
   meaningful inferences. This work thus supports both future analysis and
   the careful interpretation of existing work.}},

Abstract = {{As a first line of defense against insect herbivores many plants store
   high concentrations of toxic and deterrent secondary metabolites in
   glandular trichomes. Plant Pleiotropic Drug Resistance (PDR)-type ABC
   transporters are known secondary metabolite transporters, and several
   have been implicated in pathogen or herbivore defense. Here, we report
   on Petunia hybrida PhPDR2 as a major contributor to trichome-related
   chemical defense. PhPDR2 was found to localize to the plasma membrane
   and be predominantly expressed in multicellular glandular trichomes of
   leaves and stems. Down-regulation of PhPDR2 via RNA interference (pdr2)
   resulted in a markedly higher susceptibility of the transgenic plants to
   the generalist foliage feeder Spodoptera littoralis. Untargeted
   screening of pdr2 trichome metabolite contents showed a significant
   decrease in petuniasterone and petuniolide content, compounds, which had
   previously been shown to act as potent toxins against various insects.
   Our findings suggest that PhPDR2 plays a leading role in controlling
   petuniasterone levels in leaves and trichomes of petunia, thus
   contributing to herbivory resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Rock glaciers are landforms that form as a result of creeping mountain
   permafrost which have received considerable attention concerning their
   dynamical and thermal changes. Observed changes in rock glacier motion
   on seasonal to decadal timescales have been linked to ground temperature
   variations and related changes in landform geometries interpreted as
   signs of degradation due to climate warming. Despite the extensive
   kinematic and thermal monitoring of these creeping permafrost landforms,
   our understanding of the controlling factors remains limited and lacks
   robust quantitative models of rock glacier evolution in relation to
   their environmental setting.
   Here, we use a holistic approach to analyze the current and long-term
   dynamical development of two rock glaciers in the Swiss Alps.
   Site-specific sedimentation and ice generation rates are linked with an
   adapted numerical flow model for rock glaciers that couples the process
   chain from material deposition to rock glacier flow in order to
   reproduce observed rock glacier geometries and their general dynamics.
   Modeling experiments exploring the impact of variations in rock glacier
   temperature and sediment-ice supply show that these forcing processes
   are not sufficient to explain the currently observed short-term
   geometrical changes derived from multitemporal digital terrain models at
   the two different rock glaciers. The modeling also shows that rock
   glacier thickness is dominantly controlled by slope and rheology while
   the advance rates are mostly constrained by rates of sediment-ice
   supply. Furthermore, timescales of dynamical adjustment are found to be
   strongly linked to creep velocity. Overall, we provide a useful modeling
   framework for a better understanding of the dynamical response and
   morphological changes of rock glaciers to changes in external forcing.}},

Abstract = {{Post-translational chromatin modifications are an important regulatory
   mechanism in light signalling and circadian clock function. The
   regulation of diurnal transcript level changes requires fine-tuning of
   the expression of generally active genes depending on the prevailing

   modifications H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K9me2, H3S10p, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and
   H3S28p with diurnal changes in transcript expression using chromatin
   immunoprecipitations followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in fully expanded
   leaves 6 of Arabidopsis thaliana grown in short-day optimal and
   water-deficit conditions. We identified a differential H3K9ac, H3K27ac
   and H3S28p signature between end-of-day and end-of-night that is
   correlated with changes in diurnal transcript levels. Genes with this
   signature have particular over-represented promoter elements and encode
   proteins that are significantly enriched for transcription factors,
   circadian clock and starch catabolic process. Additional activating
   modifications were prevalent in optimally watered (H3S10p) and in
   water-deficit (H3K4me3) plants. The data suggest a mechanism for diurnal
   transcript level regulation in which reduced binding of repressive
   transcription factors facilitates activating H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H3S28p
   chromatin modifications. The presence of activating chromatin
   modification patterns on genes only at times of the day when their
   expression is required can explain why some genes are differentially
   inducible during the diurnal cycle.
   Regulation of diurnal transcript level changes requires fine-tuning of
   the expression of generally active genes. We identified changes in a
   signature of activating H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H3S28p histone modifications
   between the end-of-day and end-of-night that correlate with diurnal
   transcript level fluctuations. Genes with this signature have particular
   over-represented promoter elements, and they are enriched for
   transcription factors, circadian clock and starch catabolic process.
   This suggests a mechanism for diurnal transcript level regulation
   involving the H3K9ac|H3K27ac|H3S28p signature and explains why some
   genes are differentially inducible during the diurnal cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria that are introduced into aquatic habitats face a low substrate
   environment interspersed with rare productive `hotspots', as well as
   high protistan grazing. Whereas the former condition should select for
   growth performance, the latter should favour traits that reduce
   predation mortality, such as the formation of large cell aggregates.
   However, protected morphotypes often convey a growth disadvantage, and
   bacteria thus face a trade-off between investing in growth or defence
   traits. We set up an evolutionary experiment with the freshwater isolate
   Sphingobium sp. strain Z007 that conditionally increases aggregate
   formation in supernatants from a predatorprey coculture. We hypothesized
   that low substrate levels would favour growth performance and reduce the
   aggregated subpopulation, but that the concomitant presence of a
   flagellate predator might conserve the defence trait. After 26 (1-week)
   growth cycles either with (P+) or without (P-) predators, bacteria had
   evolved into strikingly different phenotypes. Strains from P- had low
   numbers of aggregates and increased growth yield, both at the original
   rich growth conditions and on various single carbon sources. By
   contrast, isolates from the P+ treatment formed elevated proportions of
   defence morphotypes, but exhibited lower growth yield and metabolic
   versatility. Moreover, the evolved strains from both treatments had lost
   phenotypic plasticity of aggregate formation. In summary, the
   (transient) residence of bacteria at oligotrophic conditions may promote
   a facultative oligotrophic life style, which is advantageous for
   survival in aquatic habitats. However, the investment in defence against
   predation mortality may constrain microbial adaptation to the abiotic
   environment.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{7787-7793}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Critical transitions are qualitative changes of state that occur when a
   stochastic dynamical system is forced through a critical point. Many
   critical transitions are preceded by characteristic fluctuations that
   may serve as model-independent early warning signals, implying that
   these events may be predictable in applications ranging from physics to
   biology. In nonbiological systems, the strength of such early warning
   signals has been shown partly to be determined by the speed at which the
   transition occurs. It is currently unknown whether biological systems,
   which are inherently high dimensional and typically display low
   signal-to-noise ratios, also exhibit this property, which would have
   important implications for how ecosystems are managed, particularly
   where the forces exerted on a system are anthropogenic. We examine
   whether the rate of forcing can alter the strength of early warning
   signals in (1) a model exhibiting a fold bifurcation where a state shift
   is driven by the harvesting of individuals, and (2) a model exhibiting a
   transcritical bifurcation where a state shift is driven by increased
   grazing pressure. These models predict that the rate of forcing can
   alter the detectability of early warning signals regardless of the
   underlying bifurcation the system exhibits, but that this result may be
   more pronounced in fold bifurcations. These findings have important
   implications for the management of biological populations, particularly
   harvested systems such as fisheries, and suggest that knowing the class
   of bifurcations a system will manifest may help discriminate between
   true-positive and false-positive signals.}},

Abstract = {{The extracellular subunit of the major histocompatibility complex MHCII
   plays an important role in the recognition of pathogens and the
   initiation of the adaptive immune response of vertebrates. It is widely
   accepted that pathogen-mediated selection in combination with neutral
   micro-evolutionary forces (e.g. genetic drift) shape the diversity of
   MHCII, but it has proved difficult to determine the relative effects of
   these forces. We evaluated the effect of genetic drift and balancing
   selection on MHCII diversity in 12 small populations of Galapagos
   mockingbirds belonging to four different species, and one larger
   population of the Northern mockingbird from the continental USA. After
   genotyping MHCII loci by high-throughput sequencing, we applied a
   correlational approach to explore the relationships between MHCII
   diversity and population size by proxy of island size. As expected when
   drift predominates, we found a positive effect of population size on the
   number of MHCII alleles present in a population. However, the number of
   MHCII alleles per individual and number of supertypes were not
   correlated with population size. This discrepancy points to an
   interesting feature of MHCII diversity dynamics: some levels of
   diversity might be shaped by genetic drift while others are independent
   and possibly maintained by balancing selection.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary ecologists dating back to Darwin (1871) have sought to
   understand why males are larger than females in some species, and why
   females are the larger sex in others. Although the former is widespread
   in mammals, rodents and other small mammals usually exhibit low levels
   of sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Here, we investigate patterns of sexual
   dimorphism in 34 vole species belonging to the subfamily Arvicolinae in
   a phylogenetic comparative framework. We address the potential role of
   sexual selection and fecundity selection in creating sex differences in
   body size. No support was found for hyperallometric scaling of male body
   size to female body size. We observed a marginally significant
   relationship between SSD and the ratio of male to female home range
   size, with the latter being positively related to the level of
   intrasexual competition for mates. This suggests that sexual selection
   favours larger males. Interestingly, we also found that habitat type,
   but not mating system, constitutes a strong predictor of SSD. Species
   inhabiting open habitats - where males have extensive home ranges in
   order to gain access to as many females as possible - exhibit a higher
   mean dimorphism than species inhabiting closed habitats, where females
   show strong territoriality and an uniform distribution preventing males
   to adopt a territorial strategy for gaining copulations. Nonetheless,
   variation in the strength of sexual selection is not the only selective
   force shaping SSD in voles; we also found a positive association between
   female size and litter size across lineages. Assuming this relationship
   also exists within lineages (i.e. fecundity selection on female size),
   this suggests an additional role for variation in the strength of
   fecundity selection shaping interspecific differences in female size,
   and indirectly in SSD. Therefore our results suggest that different
   selective processes act on the sizes of males and females, but because
   larger size is favoured in both sexes, SSD is on average relatively
   small.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence-based conservation planning is crucial for informing management
   decisions for species of extreme rarity, but collection of robust data
   on genetic status or other parameters can be extremely challenging for
   such species. The Hainan gibbon, possibly the world's rarest mammal,
   consists of a single population of similar to 25 individuals restricted
   to one protected area on Hainan Island, China, and has persisted for
   over 30years at exceptionally low population size. Analysis of genotypes
   at 11 microsatellite loci from faecal samples for 36\% of the current
   global population and tissue samples from 62\% of existing historical
   museum specimens demonstrates limited current genetic diversity
   (Na=2.27, Ar=2.24, H-e=0.43); diversity has declined since the 19th
   century and even further within the last 30years, representing declines
   of similar to 30\% from historical levels (Na=3.36, Ar=3.29, H-e=0.63).
   Significant differentiation is seen between current and historical
   samples (F-ST=0.156, P=0.0315), and the current population exhibits
   extremely small N-e (current N-e=2.16). There is evidence for both a
   recent population bottleneck and an earlier bottleneck, with population
   size already reasonably low by the late 19th century (historical
   N-e=1162.96). Individuals in the current population are related at the
   level of half- to full-siblings between social groups, and full-siblings
   or parent-offspring within a social group, suggesting that inbreeding is
   likely to increase in the future. The species' current reduced genetic
   diversity must be considered during conservation planning, particularly
   for expectations of likely population recovery, indicating that
   intensive, carefully planned management is essential.}},

Abstract = {{Veterinary medical product residues can cause severe damage in the dung
   ecosystem. Depending on the manner of application and the time after
   treatment, the excreted concentration of a given pharmaceutical varies.
   The popular anthelmintic drug ivermectin can be applied to livestock in
   several different ways and is fecally excreted over a period of days to
   months after application. In a field experiment replicated in summer and
   autumn, the authors mixed 6 ivermectin concentrations plus a null
   control into fresh cow dung to assess the reaction of the dung insect
   community. Taxon richness of the insect dung fauna emerging from the
   dung, but not Hill diversity (D-1) or the total number of individuals
   (abundance), decreased as ivermectin concentration increased.
   Corresponding declines in the number of emerging insects were found for
   most larger brachyceran flies and hymenopteran parasitoids, but not for
   most smaller nematoceran flies or beetles (except Hydrophilidae).
   Parallel pitfall traps recovered all major dung organism groups that
   emerged from the experimental dung, although at times in vastly
   different numbers. Ivermectin generally did not change the
   attractiveness of dung: differences in emergence therefore reflect
   differences in survival of coprophagous offspring of colonizing insects.
   Because sample size was limited to 6 replicates, the authors generally
   recommend more than 10 (seasonal) replicates and also testing higher
   concentrations than used in the present study as positive controls in
   future studies. Results accord with parallel experiments in which the
   substance was applied and passed through the cow's digestive system. In
   principle, therefore, the authors' experimental design is suitable for
   such higher-tier field tests of the response of the entire dung
   community to pharmaceutical residues, at least for ivermectin. Environ

   Thiophosphoric Triamide (NBPT) Alters Urea Assimilation and Modulates
   Transcriptional Profiles of Genes Involved in Primary and Secondary
   Metabolism in Maize Seedlings}},

Abstract = {{To limit nitrogen (N) losses from the soil, it has been suggested to
   provide urea to crops in conjunction with the urease inhibitor
   N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT). However, recent studies
   reported that NBPT affects urea uptake and urease activity in plants. To
   shed light on these latter aspects, the effects of NBPT were studied
   analysing transcriptomic and metabolic changes occurring in urea-fed
   maize seedlings after a short-term exposure to the inhibitor. We provide
   evidence that NBPT treatment led to a wide reprogramming of plant
   metabolism. NBPT inhibited the activity of endogenous urease limiting
   the release and assimilation of ureic-ammonium, with a simultaneous
   accumulation of urea in plant tissues. Furthermore, NBPT determined
   changes in the glutamine, glutamate, and asparagine contents. Microarray
   data indicate that NBPT affects ureic-N assimilation and primary
   metabolism, such as glycolysis, TCA cycle, and electron transport chain,
   while activates the phenylalanine/tyrosine-derivative pathway. Moreover,
   the expression of genes relating to the transport and complexation of
   divalent metals was strongly modulated by NBPT. Data here presented
   suggest that when NBPT is provided in conjunction with urea an imbalance
   between C and N compounds might occur in plant cells. Under this
   condition, root cells also seem to activate a response to maintain the
   homeostasis of some micronutrients.}},

Abstract = {{In previous studies, the incorporation of polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs) has been quantified in the accumulation areas of Alpine glaciers.
   Here, we introduce a model framework that quantifies mass fluxes of PCBs
   in glaciers and apply it to the Silvretta glacier (Switzerland). The
   models include PCB incorporation into the entire surface of the glacier,
   downhill transport with the flow of the glacier ice, and chemical fate
   in the glacial lake. The models are run for the years 1900-2100 and
   validated by comparing modeled and measured PCB concentrations in an ice
   core, a lake sediment core, and the glacial streamwater. The
   incorporation and release fluxes, as well as the storage of PCBs in the
   glacier increase until the 1980s and decrease thereafter. After a
   temporary increase in the 2000s, the future PCB release and the PCB
   concentrations in the glacial stream are estimated to be small but
   persistent throughout the 21st century. This study quantifies all
   relevant PCB fluxes in and from a temperate Alpine glacier over two
   centuries, and concludes that Alpine glaciers are a small secondary
   source of PCBs, but that the aftermath of environmental pollution by
   persistent and toxic chemicals can endure for decades.}},

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{181}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{571-582}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Positive species richness-productivity relationships are common in
   biodiversity experiments, but how resource availability modifies
   biodiversity effects in grass-legume mixtures composed of highly
   productive species is yet to be explicitly tested. We addressed this
   question by choosing two grasses (Arrhenatherum elatius and Dactylis
   glomerata) and two legumes (Medicago x varia and Onobrychis viciifolia)
   which are highly productive in monocultures and dominant in mixtures
   (the Jena Experiment). We established monocultures, all possible two-
   and three-species mixtures, and the four-species mixture under three
   different resource supply conditions (control, fertilization, and
   shading). Compared to the control, community biomass production
   decreased under shading (-56 \%) and increased under fertilization (+12
   \%). Net diversity effects (i.e., mixture minus mean monoculture
   biomass) were positive in the control and under shading (on average +15
   and +72 \%, respectively) and negative under fertilization (-10 \%).
   Positive complementarity effects in the control suggested resource
   partitioning and facilitation of growth through symbiotic N-2 fixation
   by legumes. Positive complementarity effects under shading indicated
   that resource partitioning is also possible when growth is
   carbon-limited. Negative complementarity effects under fertilization
   suggested that external nutrient supply depressed facilitative
   grass-legume interactions due to increased competition for light.
   Selection effects, which quantify the dominance of species with
   particularly high monoculture biomasses in the mixture, were generally
   small compared to complementarity effects, and indicated that these
   species had comparable competitive strengths in the mixture. Our study
   shows that resource availability has a strong impact on the occurrence
   of positive diversity effects among tall and highly productive grass and
   legume species.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding population dynamics is critical for the management of
   animal populations. Comparatively little is known about the relative
   importance of endogenous (i.e. density-dependent) and exogenous (i.e.
   density-independent) factors on the population dynamics of amphibians
   with complex life cycles. We examined the potential effects of
   density-dependent and -independent (i.e. climatic) factors on population
   dynamics by analyzing a 15-yr time series data of the agile frog Rana
   dalmatina population from Tarnava Mare Valley, Romania. We used two
   statistical models: 1) the partial rate correlation function to identify
   the feedback structure and the potential time lags in the time series
   data and 2) a Gompertz state-space model to simultaneously investigate
   direct and delayed density dependence as well as climatic effects on
   population growth rate. We found evidence for direct negative density
   dependence, whereas delayed density dependence and climate did not show
   a strong influence on population growth rate. Here we demonstrated that
   direct density dependence rather than delayed density dependence or
   climate determined the dynamics of our study population. Our results
   confirm the findings of many experimental studies and suggest that
   density dependence may buffer amphibian populations against
   environmental stress. Consequently, it may not be easy to scale up from
   individual-level effects to population-level effects.}},

Title = {{Convergence of soil microbial properties after plant colonization of an
   experimental plant diversity gradient}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Several studies have examined the effects of plant
   colonization on aboveground communities and processes. However, the
   effects of plant colonization on soil microbial communities are less
   known. We addressed this gap by studying effects of plant colonization
   within an experimental plant diversity gradient in subplots that had not
   been weeded for 2 and 5 years. This study was part of a long-term
   grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment) with a gradient in
   plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 60 sown species per plot).
   We measured plant species richness and productivity (aboveground cover
   and biomass) as well as soil microbial basal respiration and biomass in
   non-weeded subplots and compared the results with those of weeded
   subplots of the same plots.
   Results: After 2 and 5 years of plant colonization, the number of
   colonizing plant species decreased with increasing plant diversity,
   i.e., low-diversity plant communities were most vulnerable to
   colonization. Plant colonization offset the significant relationship
   between sown plant diversity and plant biomass production. In line with
   plant community responses, soil basal respiration and microbial biomass
   increased with increasing sown plant diversity in weeded subplots, but
   soil microbial properties converged in non-weeded subplots and were not
   significantly affected by the initial plant species richness gradient.
   Conclusion: Colonizing plant species change the quantity and quality of
   inputs to the soil, thereby altering soil microbial properties. Thus,
   plant community convergence is likely to be rapidly followed by the
   convergence of microbial properties in the soil.}},

Abstract = {{Conditions experienced during prenatal development can have long-lasting
   organizational effects on offspring. Maternal carotenoids deposited in
   the eggs of birds and other oviparous species play an important role
   during fast embryonic growth and chick development through their
   antioxidant properties. However, the long-term consequences of variation
   in maternal carotenoid transfer for the offspring have seldom been
   considered. Since plasma carotenoid levels at adulthood are known to
   influence testis size and yolk carotenoid levels influence the ability
   to extract carotenoids later in life, we hypothesized that maternally
   transmitted carotenoids might influence gonad size at adulthood. Here,
   we showed that male Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) originating from
   a carotenoid-enriched egg had smaller testes than control individuals at
   adulthood. This result shows that yolk carotenoids have long-term
   organizational effects. In addition, given that carotenoid intake at
   sexual maturity increases sperm quality and that a decreased testis size
   is associated with a lower sperm production, we propose that carotenoid
   exposure during embryo development might influence a trade-off between
   ejaculate size and sperm quality.}},

Abstract = {{Muller M. and Stewart A. Does temporary geographical proximity predict
   learning? Knowledge dynamics in the Olympic Games, Regional Studies.
   Temporary geographical proximity in the form of face-to-face contact is
   commonly thought to enhance learning. In a sample of individuals (n=294)
   involved in knowledge transfer in the Olympic Games, temporary
   geographical proximity emerges as a rather weak predictor of learning,
   although its explanatory value improves when coupled with organized
   proximity. This association disappears, however, when controlling for
   other predictors, suggesting that there is no unique effect of temporary
   geographical proximity on learning. Part of the effect of temporary
   geographical proximity is mediated through other variables, urging
   further research into the paths of mediation. Several practical
   implications for knowledge transfer in mega-events result.}},

Abstract = {{Demographic rates are shaped by the interaction of past and current
   environments that individuals in a population experience. Past
   environments shape individual states via selection and plasticity, and
   fitness-related traits (e.g. individual size) are commonly used in
   demographic analyses to represent the effect of past environments on
   demographic rates. We quantified how well the size of individuals
   captures the effects of a population's past and current environments on
   demographic rates in a well-studied experimental system of soil mites.
   We decomposed these interrelated sources of variation with a novel
   method of multiple regression that is useful for understanding nonlinear
   relationships between responses and multicollinear explanatory
   variables. We graphically present the results using area-proportional
   Venn diagrams. Our novel method was developed by combining existing
   methods and expanding upon them. We showed that the strength of size as
   a proxy for the past environment varied widely among vital rates. For
   instance, in this organism with an income breeding life history, the
   environment had more effect on reproduction than individual size, but
   with substantial overlap indicating that size encompassed some of the
   effects of the past environment on fecundity. This demonstrates that the
   strength of size as a proxy for the past environment can vary widely
   among life-history processes within a species, and this variation should
   be taken into consideration in trait-based demographic or
   individual-based approaches that focus on phenotypic traits as state
   variables. Furthermore, the strength of a proxy will depend on what
   state variable(s) and what demographic rate is being examined; that is,
   different measures of body size (e.g. length, volume, mass, fat stores)
   will be better or worse proxies for various life-history processes.}},

Abstract = {{To conserve biodiversity, scientists monitor wildlife populations and
   their habitats. Current methods have constraints, such as the costs of
   ground or aerial surveys, limited resolution of freely available
   satellite images, and expensive high-resolution satellite images.
   Recently researchers started to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or
   drones) for wildlife and habitat monitoring. Here we tested whether we
   could detect nests of the critically endangered Sumatran orang-utan on
   imagery acquired from a camera-mounted drone to determine distribution
   and density. Our results show that the distribution of nests compares
   well between aerial and ground-based surveys and that relative density
   (nest/km) shows a significant correlation between these two survey
   types. The results also indicate that both methods can be used to detect
   significant differences in relative density between previously degraded
   reforested and enriched areas. We conclude that orang-utan nest surveys
   from drones are a promising survey method to determine distribution and
   (relative) density of Sumatran orang-utans and perhaps other ape
   species.}},

Title = {{A common functional variant on the pro-inflammatory Interleukin-6 gene
   may modify the association between long-term PM10 exposure and diabetes}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Air pollutants have been linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D),
   hypothesized to act through inflammatory pathways and may induce
   interleukin-6 gene (IL6) in the airway epithelium. The cytokine
   interleukin-6 may impact on glucose homeostasis. Recent meta-analyses
   showed the common polymorphisms, IL6 -572G > C and IL6 -174G > C to be
   associated with T2D risk. These IL6 variants also influence circulatory
   interleukin-6 levels. We hypothesize that these common functional
   variants may modify the association between air pollutants and T2D.
   Methods: We cross-sectionally studied 4410 first follow-up participants
   of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases
   (SAPALDIA), aged 29 to 73 years who had complete data on genotypes,
   diabetes status and covariates. We defined diabetes as self-reported
   physician-diagnosed, or use of diabetes medication or non-fasting
   glucose > 11.1 mmol/L or HbA1c > 0.065. Air pollution exposure was
   10-year mean particulate matter < 10 mu m in diameter (PM10) assigned to
   participants' residences using a combination of dispersion modelling,
   annual trends at monitoring stations and residential history. We derived
   interaction terms between PM10 and genotypes, and applied mixed logistic
   models to explore genetic interactions by IL6 polymorphisms on the odds
   of diabetes.
   Results: There were 252 diabetes cases. Respective minor allele
   frequencies of IL6 -572G > C and IL6 -174G > C were 7 and 39 \%. Mean
   exposure to PM10 was 22 mu g/m(3). Both variants were not associated
   with diabetes in our study. We observed a significant positive
   association between PM10 and diabetes among homozygous carriers of the
   pro-inflammatory major G-allele of IL6 -572G > C {[}Odds ratio: 1.53; 95
   \% confidence interval (1.22, 1.92); P-interaction ((additive)) = 0.003
   and P-interaction ((recessive)) = 0.006]. Carriers of the major G-allele
   of IL6 -174G > C also had significantly increased odds of diabetes, but
   interactions were statistically non-significant.
   Conclusions: Our results on the interaction of PM10 with functionally
   well described polymorphisms in an important pro-inflammatory candidate
   gene are consistent with the hypothesis that air pollutants impact on
   T2D through inflammatory pathways. Our findings, if confirmed, are of
   high public health relevance considering the ubiquity of the major G
   allele, which puts a substantial proportion of the population at risk
   for the development of diabetes as a result of long-term exposure to air
   pollution.}},

Abstract = {{Time is an extremely valuable resource but little is known about the
   efficiency of time allocation in decision-making. Empirical evidence
   suggests that in many ecologically relevant situations, decision
   difficulty and the relative reward from making a correct choice,
   compared to an incorrect one, are inversely linked, implying that it is
   optimal to use relatively less time for difficult choice problems. This
   applies, in particular, to value-based choices, in which the relative
   reward from choosing the higher valued item shrinks as the values of the
   other options get closer to the best option and are thus more difficult
   to discriminate. Here, we experimentally show that people behave
   sub-optimally in such contexts. They do not respond to incentives that
   favour the allocation of time to choice problems in which the relative
   reward for choosing the best option is high; instead they spend too much
   time on problems in which the reward difference between the options is
   low. We demonstrate this by showing that it is possible to improve
   subjects' time allocation with a simple intervention that cuts them off
   when their decisions take too long. Thus, we provide a novel form of
   evidence that organisms systematically spend their valuable time in an
   inefficient way, and simultaneously offer a potential solution to the
   problem.}},

Title = {{Phenotype-associated inbreeding biases estimates of inbreeding

Abstract = {{Inbreeding depression is usually quantified by regressing individual
   phenotypic values on inbreeding coefficients, implicitly assuming there
   is no correlation between an individual's phenotype and the kinship
   coefficient to its mate. If such an association between parental
   phenotype and parental kinship exists, and if the trait of interest is
   heritable, estimates of inbreeding depression can be biased. Here we
   first derive the expected bias as a function of the covariance between
   mean parental breeding value and parental kinship. Subsequently, we use
   simulated data to confirm the existence of this bias, and show that it
   can be accounted for in a quantitative genetic animal model. Finally, we
   use long-term individual-based data for white-throated dippers (Cinclus
   cinclus), a bird species in which inbreeding is relatively common, to
   obtain an empirical estimate of this bias. We show that during part of
   the study period, parents of inbred birds had shorter wings than those
   of outbred birds, and as wing length is heritable, inbred individuals
   were smaller, independent of any inbreeding effects. This resulted in
   the overestimation of inbreeding effects. Similarly, during a period
   when parents of inbred birds had longer wings, we found that inbreeding
   effects were underestimated. We discuss how such associations may have
   arisen in this system, and why they are likely to occur in others, too.
   Overall, we demonstrate how less biased estimates of inbreeding
   depression can be obtained within a quantitative genetic framework, and
   suggest that inbreeding and additive genetic effects should be accounted
   for simultaneously whenever possible.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary models of dispersal frequently lack explicit reference to
   the age or sex of the individuals that disperse. This contrasts with
   reality where dispersal behavior strongly depends on individuals' state,
   including age. To study why natal dispersal occurs more commonly than
   breeding dispersal, we investigate the interplay of 2 categories of
   explanation: the asset-protection principle (APP) and the ``multiplier
   effect{''} (ME). The APP states that adults in possession of territories
   should be more reluctant to disperse. According to the ME, the simple
   fact of being born tells individuals that the site is of high quality,
   which may promote philopatry. Our model is set in habitats of spatially
   varying quality and individuals express different dispersal rates
   depending on state (life-history stage, sex, and quality of residential
   habitat). The model considers the accuracy of information about habitat
   quality, the proportion of good quality habitat, and the magnitude of
   habitat quality variation. We show that the predictions of the APP hold,
   but only when the ``invisible{''} asset of likely future prospects in
   the current habitat is taken into account. Effects of the ME are
   consistently harder to detect, mainly due to density dependency
   overriding the benefits of habitat quality. We predict higher natal than
   breeding dispersal when territorial vacancies are scarce, and more
   variable breeding than natal dispersal when they are common.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{232}},
Pages = {{285-298}},
Abstract = {{Mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs) are highly elongate subglacial
   bedforms associated with ice streaming. However, the link between MSGLs
   and rapid ice flow is largely qualitative, and there have been few
   attempts to quantitatively link their formation to ice flow
   characteristics (e.g. ice velocity, thickness, basal shear stress). We
   take measurements of MSGLs from a palaeo-ice stream that once occupied
   Marguerite Trough, Antarctic Peninsula and explore a range of possible
   correlations with ice dynamics generated from an ensemble of numerical
   modelling experiments that reproduce the deglaciation of the ice stream.
   Our results confirm that high mean ice velocities and a weak bed
   correlate with longer MSGLs. Furthermore, the height of MSGLs are low
   (2-3 m) where modelled basal shear stress is low, but their height tends
   to be higher and more variable where basal shear stress is larger. The
   mean density of MSGLs decreases as ice flux increases. Our analysis
   further suggests that the length of MSGLs is a function of basal ice
   velocity and time. Although our data/model correlations confirm the
   importance of ice velocity in MSGL formation, a significant challenge
   remains if we are to employ MSGLs as a quantifiable measure of past ice
   stream velocity.}},

Title = {{Influence of migratory ungulate management on competitive interactions
   with resident species in a protected area}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Migratory animals can represent links between protected and unprotected
   parts of their home ranges. Management of such species outside a
   conservation area can influence species interactions inside the
   protected zone. This may result in unintended effects on populations of
   conservation concern even if they spend their entire life cycle within
   the protected area. We examined interspecific interactions between three
   species of large herbivores in the absence of mammalian predators in the
   Swiss National Park, and assessed whether the population size of the
   migratory red deer (Cervus elaphus) that is harvested outside the park
   in autumn and winter affected the two resident species, chamois
   (Rupicapra rupicapra) and ibex (Capra ibex). Dietary overlap was high
   between the three species while they co-occurred in the park, suggesting
   potential for interspecific resource competition. Particularly the
   habitat use of chamois was affected by red deer population size, with
   decreased use of meadows and forest with increasing red deer numbers,
   and increased use of areas covered by scree. Ibex habitat use was
   affected by the population sizes of all three species, but effects
   differed between species and season. Moreover, horn growth in young
   chamois and the population growth rate of ibex were negatively related
   to red deer numbers. The results suggest that high population size of
   red deer negatively affects ibex and chamois through the migratory
   behavior of red deer between protected and non-protected areas.
   Effective management of a migratory ungulate species outside the
   protected part of its range, taking account of its ecology and natural
   behavior, can thus have positive effects on populations within a
   protected area by alleviating interspecific competition. However, this

Abstract = {{Genetic monitoring has emerged as a useful tool to better understand
   evolutionary processes acting within and among natural populations.
   Longitudinal studies allow the examination of temporal changes in
   neutral genetic patterns in relation to demographic data, which is
   particularly interesting in populations that undergo large fluctuations
   in size. Taking advantage of eight years (2006-2013) of genetic survey
   data (18 microsatellite loci) from a snow vole (Chionomys nivalis)
   population in the Swiss Alps, we explore whether and how gene flow and
   selection shape temporal variability in genetic diversity by
   counteracting the effect of genetic drift, and thereby maintain the high
   levels of heterozygosity observed in this population. Using simulations
   and empirical data, we show that effective population size is small, and
   that genetic drift would lead to a marked decline in genetic diversity.
   However, this force is counterbalanced by the restoring effect of
   immigration. In agreement with the predictions of neutral genetic
   theory, we found a strong, positive association between genetic
   diversity and population size, which suggests positive density-dependent
   dispersal. This is also supported by the observed changes in genetic
   composition overtime. Meanwhile, selection for heterozygosity was weak,
   overriding the effect of drift only in one out of eight years.
   Altogether, our results highlight the importance of gene flow as a
   significant evolutionary force in shaping genetic patterns in the wild,
   and as a crucial-process for the maintenance of genetic diversity in
   small populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To improve understanding of natural and managed flow regimes in
   data-sparse regulated river systems in montane areas, the commonly used
   Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) conceptual run-off model
   was adapted to incorporate water regulation components. The extended
   model was then applied to the heavily regulated river Lyon (391 km(2))
   in Scotland to reconstruct the natural flow regime and to assess the
   impacts of regulation at increasing spatial scales. Multi-criteria model
   evaluation demonstrated that the model performed well in capturing the
   dominant catchment processes and regulation effects, especially at the
   timescales at which operation rules apply. The main change as a result
   of regulation in the river Lyon is a decrease in inter-annual and
   intra-annual variability of all elements of the flow regime, in terms of
   magnitude, frequency, and duration. Although these impacts are most
   pronounced directly downstream of the impoundments, the regulation
   effects propagate throughout the river system. The modelling approach is
   flexible and widely applicable and only limited amounts of data are
   required. Moreover, results are easily communicated to stakeholders. It
   has the potential to contribute to the development of flow regimes that
   may be more beneficial to the ecological status of rivers. In the case
   of the river Lyon, it is likely that this involves a more variable
   release regime. The approach developed here provides a tool for
   assessing impacts on flow regimes and informing environmental flows in
   other data-sparse regions with heavily regulated montane river systems.

Abstract = {{Aim We test whether the modern regionalization of the angiosperm flora
   is the result of Cenozoic barriers to dispersal.
   Location Global.
   Methods We used a database of Cenozoic woody angiosperm fossils to build
   a matrix of family and genus occurrence at 11 continents/regions for
   five time periods of the Cenozoic, thus defining 55 floras. We used
   ordinations and cluster analyses to infer the relationships among these
   floras. We tested for the effects of time, land connections and
   dispersal barriers on the similarities between these woody angiosperm
   floras.
   Results For all time periods of the Cenozoic the world's woody
   angiosperm floras were grouped into three large clusters: a very compact
   Northern Hemisphere cluster (North America, Europe, temperate Asia and
   Palaeogene south China), a somewhat less compact Palaeotropical cluster
   (Africa, India, Southeast Asia and Neogene south China) and a rather
   diffuse Gondwanan cluster (Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, temperate
   South America and the Neotropics). The primary clustering is evidently
   geographical, and reflects the barriers formed by the Tethys and the
   southern Atlantic-southern Indian oceans. There is evidence that the
   more recent Gondwanan floras are more divergent than the older floras,
   possibly due to long isolation by oceans and multiple extinction events,
   whereas the similarities among Northern Hemisphere floras increased
   during the Neogene.
   Main conclusions The modern regionalization is mainly the result of
   dispersal barriers that existed at diverse times in the Cenozoic,
   resulting in several woody angiosperm floras that evolved in parallel.
   Climatic change and dispersal also played important roles in shaping
   biogeographical patterns of Cenozoic woody angiosperms.}},

Title = {{Structure-dynamic relationship of plant-insect networks along a primary
   succession gradient on a glacier foreland}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{314}},
Pages = {{73-79}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in understanding the structure-dynamic
   relationship of ecological networks. Ecological network changes along
   primary successions are poorly known: to address such topic, gradient of
   primary succession on glacier forelands is an ideal model, as sites of
   different age since deglaciation stand for different ecosystem
   developmental stages. We aimed to investigate the assembly processes of
   plant-insect networks and to elucidate its functional implications for
   ecosystem stability along this time sequence succession. We collected
   data on the functional role of anthophilous insect groups and performed
   network analysis to evaluate their relative importance in the structure
   of plant-insect interaction networks with increasing time since
   deglaciation along the primary succession of a debris-covered glacier
   foreland. We sampled anthophilous insects visiting the flowers of two
   models plant species, Leucanthemopsis alpina and Saxifraga bryoides.
   Insects were identified and trophic roles were attributed to each taxon
   (detritivores, parasitoids, phytophagous, pollinators, predators, and
   opportunists) at five sites representing the primary succession
   gradient. Plant-insect interactions were visually represented by a
   bipartite network for each successional stage. For each plant species
   and insect group, centrality indices were computed quantifying their
   community importance. For the whole network, centralization and link
   density were calculated. Pollinators dominated pioneer communities on
   the debris-covered glacier and in recently deglaciated areas, while
   parasitoids, predators and opportunists characterised late-succession
   stages. Plant species centrality varied along the succession.
   Pollinators showed initially higher but then decreasing centrality,
   while the centrality of predators and parasitoids increased with time
   since deglaciation. Along the same gradient link density showed an
   increasing trend while network centralization tended to decrease. The
   present study provides new insight into the initial steps of
   plant-insect network assembly and sheds light on the relationship
   between structure and dynamic in ecological networks. In particular,
   during the succession process, more links are formed and
   plant-anthophilous insect interactions change from a network dominated
   by pollinators to a functionally more diversified food web. We conclude
   that applying network theory to the study of primary succession provides
   a useful framework to investigate the relationship between community
   structure and ecosystem stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   leaves from plants grown in Brazil. The total content of these four
   bufadienolides was significantly lower in plants cultivated in Germany

   juices obtained from plants cultivated in Germany and Brazil,
   respectively. When analysing single leaves from individual plants, the
   content of bufadienolides was markedly higher in young leaves. For
   comparative purposes, the content of these bufadienolides was also
   determined in Bryophyllum daigremontianum and Bryophyllum tubiflorum.
   Bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate (4) was predominant in the leaves of B.

Abstract = {{Ciliate assemblages play a significant role in the microbial food web.
   The effects of environmental temperature on assemblage composition may
   be influenced by abiotic factors such as seasonality and disturbance,
   but the effects of temperature on ciliate assemblages found on different
   substrata have not been explored. Sandy bottoms and submerged rocks
   harbour dissimilar ciliate assemblages, and it might be expected that
   their ciliate assemblages will respond differently to temperature.
   We studied how alpha diversity, beta diversity and total biomass of
   ciliate protist assemblages found on sandy bottoms and submerged rocks
   differed in 13 geothermally heated streams in Iceland whose mean
   temperatures range from 5 to 20 degrees C. We recorded number of
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and measured the size of cells in
   ciliate assemblages from both substrata.
   Effects of temperature on natural ciliate assemblages were substratum
   dependent. On rock surfaces, both total ciliate biomass and alpha
   diversity declined with increasing temperature, and beta diversity
   increased with increasing temperature difference due to OTU nestedness
   (assemblages from warm streams being composed chiefly of subsets of the
   OTUs found in colder streams). In sandy substrata, however, ciliate
   assemblage composition was independent of temperature.
   Substratum-specific responses may be due to differences in mechanical
   disturbance, nutrient availability or exposure to invertebrate grazers.
   Rock-surface assemblages may be more exposed to the flow and retain less
   nutrient than those of sandy substratum; thus, they may be more strongly
   resource limited and more responsive to direct effects of temperature on
   metabolism. Alternatively, rock-surface assemblages may be more exposed
   to grazing by invertebrates, which intensifies with temperature.
   Our study highlights the need to account for environmental context such
   as substratum type to fully understand the effect of temperature on
   microbial assemblages in streams. Future increases in global
   temperatures may affect fresh waters differently depending on their
   prevalent substratum. Those dominated by hard substrata may have their
   ciliate assemblages, and thus, food-web structures and ecosystem
   functioning more strongly affected by warming relative to systems
   dominated by soft substrata.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between plant and soil communities are known to play an
   integral role in shaping ecosystems. Plants influence the composition of
   soil communities and soil communities in turn influence plant
   performance. Such a plant-soil feedback may incur selection pressure on
   plants and the associating soil community. However, the evolutionary
   consequences of these above-belowground feedback interactions remain
   largely speculative. Here we assess whether plant-soil feedback effects
   differ between intraspecific plant populations and between generations
   within the same plant population. We used two populations of Trifolium
   pratense and assessed their performance when grown in association with
   their home versus away soil biota. Both populations were colonized by
   distinct microbial communities and performed better with their own home
   soil communities than with the soil community from the other
   intraspecific population, demonstrating intraspecific positive feedback
   effects of home soil. In one of the two populations, we found that plant
   performance and the root associated microbiota community differed
   between parental and progeny plants when inoculated with their own home
   soil. Differences in root associated community characteristics could
   explain more than 80\% of the variation in performance among the progeny
   and parental plants. Our results highlight that intraspecific
   differences in both plant and associated soil communities shape
   plant-soil feedback effects, and consequently indicate that plant-soil
   feedback can influence the direction of selection between intraspecific
   plant populations.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the palynological study of the Seceda core drilled in the
   north-western Dolomites and of an outcrop section from Val Gola-Margon
   (Southern Alps, Northern Italy) we propose a new palynostratigraphic
   subdivision of the Middle Triassic of the Western Tethyan realm. The six
   new zones (TrS-A-TrS-F) cover the interval between the late Anisian
   (Illyrian) and the late Ladinian (Longobardian). The zonation is based
   on the first and last appearances of individual taxa as well as on the
   quantitative distribution of major groups of sporomorphs. The presented
   palynological succession is directly correlated with the precise
   biostratigraphic, magnetostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic framework
   of the Seceda section, which represents the principal auxiliary global
   stratotype section and point (GSSP) section of the Ladinian stage. As an
   additional record we use the data of Van der Eem (1983) newly calibrated
   using the detailed lithostratigraphic scheme of the Seceda section and
   the GSSP section from Bagolino. The reassessment of the data from the
   late Anisian and the Ladinian of Van der Eem (1983) and Brugman (1986)
   shows earlier occurrences of some of the major pollen groups, and
   results in more precise correlations with other areas. The overlapping
   ranges of the palynological phases and subphases proposed by Van der Eem
   (1983) and Brugman (1986) make some of these phases obsolete.
   Within the studied interval the distribution of sporomorphs shows some
   major changes such as a major reduction of pteridosperms (e.g. taeniate
   bisaccate pollen), which are abundant in the lower part of the section
   (zone TrS-A) and are subsequently replaced by conifers (e.g.
   Triadispora, Ovalipollis and Circumpolles).
   Palynofacies studies show that the relatively high amount of fluorescent
   amorphous organic matter (AOM) reflects dysoxic conditions in the
   lowermost part of the section ({''}Plattenkalke{''}). The change in
   palynofacies between the ``Plattenkalke{''} and the ``Knollenkalke{''}
   corresponds to a marked change in the depositional environment from
   dysoxic to well oxygenated conditions in the ``Knollenkalke{''}. In
   contrast to this, the succession of palynofacies from the
   ``Knollenkalke{''} to the ``Breccias{''} suggests a continuity of
   depositional environments reflecting a slight reduction of the oxic
   conditions. The light coloured pollen grains show no sign of thermal
   alteration of the organic matter. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The airborne prism experiment (APEX) is an imaging spectrometer
   developed by a joint Swiss-Belgian consortium composed of institutes
   (University of Zurich, Flemish Institute for Technological Research) and
   industries (RUAG, OIP, Netcetera), supported by the European Space
   Agency's PRODEX programme. APEX is designed to support the development
   of future space-borne Earth observation systems by simulating,
   calibrating or validating existing or planned optical satellite
   missions. Therefore, periodic extensive calibration of APEX is one major
   objective within the project. APEX calibration under laboratory
   conditions is done at its dedicated calibration and characterization
   facility at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen,
   Germany. While environmental influences under laboratory conditions are
   reduced to a minimum, the effects of atmospheric absorption and the
   properties of the underlying calibration infrastructure may still
   influence the measurements and subsequently the accuracy of the sensor
   spectral response estimations. It is demonstrated that even a lightpath
   of similar to 2 m through the atmosphere or the monochromator grating
   can have significant impact on the spectral response estimation of the
   sensor. A normalization approach described in this letter is able to
   compensate for these effects. The correction algorithm is exemplarily
   demonstrated on actual measurements for the short wavelength-IR range
   channel.}},

   was already affected by the avalanche barriers, which are accepted
   because of their vital protective function. No significant difference
   was found between residents' and tourists' evaluation of the new

Abstract = {{Pollination is an important early step in sexual plant reproduction. In
   Arabidopsis thaliana, sequential pollination events, from pollen
   adhesion onto the stigma surface to pollen tube germination and
   elongation, occur on the stigmatic papilla cells. Following successful
   completion of these events, the pollen tube penetrates the stigma and
   finally fertilizes a female gametophyte. The pollination events are
   thought to be initiated and regulated by interactions between papilla
   cells and pollen. Here, we report the characterization of gene
   expression profiles of unpollinated (UP), compatible pollinated (CP) and
   incompatible pollinated (IP) papilla cells in A. thaliana. Based on cell
   type-specific transcriptome analysis from a combination of laser
   microdissection and RNA sequencing, 15,475, 17,360 and 16,918 genes were
   identified as expressed in UP, CP and IP papilla cells, respectively,
   and, of these, 14,392 genes were present in all three data sets.
   Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analyses identified 147 and 71 genes
   up-regulated in CP and IP papilla cells, respectively, and 115 and 46
   genes down-regulated. Gene Ontology and metabolic pathway analyses
   revealed that papilla cells play an active role as the female
   reproductive component in pollination, particularly in information
   exchange, signal transduction, internal physiological changes and
   external morphological modification. This study provides fundamental
   information on the molecular mechanisms involved in pollination in
   papilla cells, furthering our understanding of the reproductive role of
   papilla cells.}},

Title = {{Female sterility associated with increased clonal propagation suggests a
   unique combination of androdioecy and asexual reproduction in
   populations of Cardamine amara (Brassicaceae)}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims The coexistence of hermaphrodites and female-sterile
   individuals, or androdioecy, has been documented in only a handful of
   plants and animals. This study reports its existence in the plant
   species Cardamine amara (Brassicaceae), in which female-sterile
   individuals have shorter pistils than seed-producing hermaphrodites.
   Methods Morphological analysis, in situ manual pollination,
   microsatellite genotyping and differential gene expression analysis
   using Arabidopsis microarrays were used to delimit variation between
   female-sterile individuals and hermaphrodites.
   Key Results Female sterility in C. amara appears to be caused by
   disrupted ovule development. It was associated with a 2.4- to 2.9-fold
   increase in clonal propagation. This made the pollen number of
   female-sterile genets more than double that of hermaphrodite genets,
   which fulfils a condition of co-existence predicted by simple
   androdioecy theories. When female-sterile individuals were observed in
   wild androdioecious populations, their ramet frequencies ranged from 5
   to 54 \%; however, their genet frequencies ranged from 11 to 29 \%,
   which is consistent with the theoretically predicted upper limit of 50
   \%.
   Conclusions The results suggest that a combination of sexual
   reproduction and increased asexual proliferation by female-sterile
   individuals probably explains the invasion and maintenance of female
   sterility in otherwise hermaphroditic populations. To our knowledge,
   this is the first report of the coexistence of female sterility and
   hermaphrodites in the Brassicaceae.}},

Abstract = {{Needle-leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) of a Norway spruce stand was
   estimated from CHRIS-PROBA images using the canopy reflectance simulated
   by the PROSPECT model coupled with two canopy reflectance models: 1)
   discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model (DART); and 2) PARAS. The
   DART model uses a detailed description of the forest scene, whereas
   PARAS is based on the photon recollision probability theory and uses a
   simplified forest structural description. Subsequently, statistically
   significant empirical functions between the optical indices
   ANCB(670-720) and ANMB(670-720) and the needle-leaf Cab content were
   established and then applied to CHRIS-PROBA data. The Cab estimating
   regressions using ANMB(670-720) were more robust than using
   ANCB(670-720) since the latter was more sensitive to LAI, especially in
   case of PARAS. Comparison between Cab estimates showed strong linear
   correlations between PARAS and DART retrievals, with a nearly perfect
   one-to-one fit when using ANMB(670-720) (slope = 1.1, offset = 11 mu g
   center dot cm(-2)). Further comparison with Cab estimated froman AISA
   Eagle image of the same stand showed better results for PARAS (RMSE =
   2.7 mu g center dot cm(-2) for ANCB(670-720); RMSE = 9.5 mu g center dot
   cm(-2) for ANMB(670-720)) than for DART (RMSE = 7.5 mu g center dot
   cm(-2) for ANCB(670-720); RMSE = 23 mu g center dot cm(-2) for
   ANMB(670-720)). Although these results show the potential for simpler
   models like PARAS in estimating needle-leaf Cab from satellite imaging
   spectroscopy data, further analyses regarding parameterization of
   radiative transfer models are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural innovation in low-income tropical countries contributes to
   a more effective and sustainable use of natural resources and reduces
   hunger and poverty through economic development in rural areas. Yet,
   despite numerous recent public and private initiatives to develop
   capacities for agricultural innovation, such initiatives are often not
   well aligned with national efforts to revive existing Agricultural
   Innovation Systems (AIS). In an effort to improve coordination and
   responsiveness of Capacity Development (CD) initiatives, the G20
   Agriculture Ministers requested the Food and Agriculture Organization of
   the United Nations (FAO) to lead the development of a Tropical
   Agricultural Platform (TAP), which is designed to improve coherence and
   coordination of CD for agricultural innovation in the tropics. This
   paper presents a summary of the results obtained from three regional
   needs assessments undertaken by TAP and its partners. The surveyed
   tropical regions were Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Central
   America. The findings reveal a mismatch in all three regions between the
   external supply of primarily individual CD and the actual demand for
   institutional CD. The misalignment might be addressed by strengthening
   south-south and triangular collaboration and by improving the
   institutional capacities that would render national AIS more
   demand-oriented and responsive to the needs of smallholders in domestic
   agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering time in annual plants has large fitness consequences and has
   been the focus of theoretical and empirical study. Previous theory has
   concluded that flowering time has evolved over evolutionary time to
   maximize fitness over a particular season length. We introduce a new
   model where flowering is cued by a growth-rate rule (peak nitrogen (N)).
   Flowering is therefore sensitive to physiological parameters and to
   current environmental conditions, including N availability and the
   presence of competitors. The model predicts that, when overall
   conditions are suitable for flowering, plants should never flower after
   peak N', the point during development when the whole-plant N uptake rate
   reaches its maximum. Our model further predicts correlations between
   flowering time and vegetative growth rates, and that the response to
   increased N depends heavily on how this extra N is made available. We
   compare our predictions to observations in the literature. We suggest
   that annual plants may have evolved to use growth-rate rules as part of
   the cue for flowering, allowing them to smoothly and optimally adjust
   their flowering time to a wide range of local conditions. If so, there
   are widespread implications for the study of the molecular biology
   behind flowering pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, the British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) was thought to have
   reached no farther than a mid-continental shelf position in the Hebrides
   Sector, NW Britain, during the last glaciation (traditional model).
   However, recent discovery of widespread shelf-edge moraines in this
   sector has led to a suggestion of much more extensive ice (Atlantic
   Shelf model). The position of the St Kilda archipelago, approximately
   mid-way between the Outer Hebrides and the continental shelf edge, makes
   it ideal as an onshore location to test which of the two competing
   models is more viable. To this end, we (i) reassessed the
   characteristics, stratigraphy and morphology of the Quaternary sediments
   exposed on the largest island (Hirta), and (ii) applied time-dependent
   2D numerical modelling of possible glacier formation on Hirta. Instead
   of three glaciations (as previously suggested), we identified evidence
   of only two, including one of entirely local derivation. The numerical
   model supports the view that this glaciation was in the form of two
   short glaciers occupying the two valleys that dominate Hirta. The good
   state of preservation of the glacial sediments and associated moraine of
   this local glaciation indicate relatively recent formation. In view of
   the low inferred equilibrium line altitude of the glacier associated
   with the best morphological evidence (approximate to 120m), considerable
   thickness of slope deposits outside the glacial limits and evidence of
   only one rather than two tills, a Late Devensian rather than Younger
   Dryas age is preferred for this glaciation. Re-examination of the
   submarine moraine pattern from available bathymetry suggests that the
   ice sheet was forced to flow around St Kilda, implying that the ice was
   of insufficient thickness to overrun the islands. Accepting this leaves
   open the possibility that a St Kilda nunatak supported local ice while
   the ice sheet extended to the continental shelf edge.}},

Abstract = {{International policies for mitigation of climate change provide a global
   public good and thus suffer from ``free riding,{''} i.e., inaction of
   governments. In 25 years of negotiations under the UN Framework
   Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the regime has changed its
   character from a top-down approach based on mandatory emissions
   commitments to a bottom-up system of voluntary government pledges. At
   the same time, various initiatives by governments at all levels and
   private companies have been established, but most are limited to
   emissions reporting and exchange of knowledge on mitigation
   technologies. None of the alternatives has shown a higher mitigation
   effectiveness than the Kyoto Protocol. Generally, the transition toward
   a bottom-up regime risks a reduction of transparency and increases in
   the transaction costs of mitigation. Although it could give rise to a
   club of countries engaging in strong mitigation that could expand over
   time, it is unlikely to be ambitious enough to achieve the target of
   limiting warming to 2 degrees C. On the one hand, carbon prices will be
   applied in a larger number of jurisdictions, and mitigation technologies
   diffuse around the world. On the other hand, carbon price levels will
   remain relatively low, and their mitigation benefits will be more than
   outweighed by the growth of infrastructure and consumption. Thus, a
   temperature increase of at least 3 degrees C by 2100 becomes more and
   more likely.}},

Abstract = {{Healing Animals, Feeding Souls: Ethnobotanical Values at Sacred Sites in
   Central Italy. Ethnobotanical knowledge is a fundamental repository of
   the values and applications of different plants. This knowledge is often
   related to spiritual beliefs and religious sites, where plants have been
   nurtured and conserved for their use in rituals and traditional
   practices. While this link is well known for different areas of the
   global south, it has hardly been investigated in relatively more secular
   and modernized Western contexts. Here, we use first-hand vegetation
   surveys and published records to examine the occurrence of
   ethnobotanical values at 30 Catholic shrines in Central Italy, and
   compare them with an equal number of non-sacred control sites. We ask
   this: to what extent is there an association of useful plants with
   sacred places in Italy, as found in other cultural contexts? We show
   that a greater number of useful plants are found at sacred sites. While
   this is mainly a consequence of the higher species richness of sacred
   sites, an association with plants used in animal husbandry is
   particularly evident, and likely related to the deep historical
   connection between sacred places and pastoralist traditions in Central
   Italy. Also, we show that there are significant variations in the
   distribution of old trees; the largest specimens are found at the center
   of sacred sites, while tree size visibly decreases away from the
   shrines. This indicates also that individual trees have been actively
   managed and conserved at sacred sites, probably driven by the symbolic
   values that old trees frequently embody.}},

Abstract = {{The routing and storage of meltwater and the configuration of drainage
   systems in glaciers exert a profound influence on glacier behaviour.
   However, little is known about the hydrological systems of cold
   glaciers, which form a significant proportion of the total glacier
   population in the climate sensitive region of the High Arctic. Using
   glacio-speleological techniques, we obtained direct access to explore
   and survey three conduit systems and one moulin within the tongue area
   of Tellbreen, a small cold-based valley glacier in central Spitsbergen.
   More than 600m of conduits were surveyed and mapped in plan, profile and
   cross-section view to analyse the configuration of the drainage system.
   The investigations revealed that cold-based glaciers can exhibit a
   dendritic drainage network with supra-, en- and subglacial components
   formed most likely by cut-and-closure processes as well as
   surface-to-bed drainage via moulins. Furthermore, we observed that water
   is stored within the glacier and released gradually via subglacial
   conduits during the winter months, forming a large and active icing in
   the proglacial area. The presence of supra-, en- and subglacial
   components, the surface-to-bed moulin and the dendritic subglacial
   drainage network suggest that existing models and understanding of the
   hydrology of cold glaciers needs to be re-evaluated, mostly concerning
   the different possible pathways and processes that form the hydrological
   system.}},

Abstract = {{The heritability (h(2)) of fitness traits is often low. Although this
   has been attributed to directional selection having eroded genetic
   variation in direct proportion to the strength of selection,
   heritability does not necessarily reflect a trait's additive genetic
   variance and evolutionary potential ({''}evolvability{''}). Recent
   studies suggest that the low h2 of fitness traits in wild populations is
   caused not by a paucity of additive genetic variance (V-A) but by
   greater environmental or nonadditive genetic variance (V-R). We examined
   the relationship between h(2) and variance-standardized selection
   intensities (i or beta(sigma)), and between evolvability (I-A:V-A
   divided by squared phenotypic trait mean) and mean-standardized
   selection gradients (beta(mu)). Using 24 years of data from an island
   population of Savannah sparrows, we show that, across diverse traits,
   h(2) declines with the strength of selection, whereas I-A and I-R (V-R
   divided by squared trait mean) are independent of the strength of
   selection. Within trait types (morphological, reproductive,
   life-history), h(2), I-A, and I-R are all independent of the strength of
   selection. This indicates that certain traits have low heritability
   because of increased residual variance due to the age at which they are
   expressed or the multiple factors influencing their expression, rather
   than their association with fitness.}},

Title = {{Effects of Recent Environmental Change on Accuracy of Inferences of
   Extinction Status}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{971-981}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Correctly classifying a species as extinct or extant is of critical
   importance if current rates of biodiversity loss are to be accurately
   quantified. Observing an extinction event is rare, so in many cases
   extinction status is inferred using methods based on the analysis of
   records of historic sighting events. The accuracy of such methods is
   difficult to test. However, results of recent experiments with microcosm
   communities suggest that the rate at which a population declines to
   extinction, potentially driven by varying environmental conditions, may
   alter one's ability accurately to infer extinction status. We tested how
   the rate of population decline, driven by historic environmental change,
   alters the accuracy of 6 commonly applied sighting-based methods used to
   infer extinction. We used data from small-scale experimental communities
   and recorded wild population extirpations. We assessed how accuracy of
   the different methods was affected by rate of population decline, search
   effort, and number of sighting events recorded. Rate of population
   decline and historic population size of the species affected the
   accuracy of inferred extinction dates; however, faster declines produced
   more accurate inferred dates of extinction, but only when population
   sizes were higher. Optimal linear estimation (OLE) offered the most
   reliable and robust estimates, though no single method performed best in
   all situations, and it may be appropriate to use a different method if
   information regarding historic search efforts is available. OLE provided
   the most accurate estimates of extinction when the number of sighting
   events used was >10, and future use of this method should take this into
   account. Data from experimental populations provide added insight into
   testing techniques to discern wild extirpation events. Care should be
   taken designing such experiments so that they mirror closely the
   abundance dynamics of populations affected by real-world extirpation
   events.}},

Title = {{Hybridization Alters Spontaneous Mutation Rates in a

Journal = {{PLANT PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{165}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{424-437}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Over 70 years ago, increased spontaneous mutation rates were observed in
   Drosophila spp. hybrids, but the genetic basis of this phenomenon is not
   well understood. The model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)
   offers unique opportunities to study the types of mutations induced upon
   hybridization and the frequency of their occurrence. Understanding the
   mutational effects of hybridization is important, as many crop plants
   are grown as hybrids. Besides, hybridization is important for speciation
   and its effects on genome integrity could be critical, as chromosomal
   rearrangements can lead to reproductive isolation. We examined the rates
   of hybridization-induced point and frameshift mutations as well as
   homologous recombination events in intraspecific Arabidopsis hybrids
   using a set of transgenic mutation detector lines that carry mutated or
   truncated versions of a reporter gene. We found that hybridization
   alters the frequency of different kinds of mutations. In general,
   Columbia (Col) 3 Cape Verde Islands and Col X C24 hybrid progeny had
   decreased T -> G and T -> A transversion rates but an increased C -> T
   transition rate. Significant changes in frameshift mutation rates were
   also observed in some hybrids. In Col X C24 hybrids, there is a trend
   for increased homologous recombination rates, except for the hybrids
   from one line, while in Col X Cape Verde Islands hybrids, this rate is
   decreased. The overall genetic distance of the parents had no influence
   on mutation rates in the progeny, as closely related accessions on
   occasion displayed higher mutation rates than accessions that are
   separated farther apart. However, reciprocal hybrids had significantly
   different mutation rates, suggesting parent-of- origin-dependent effects
   on the mutation frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Forty-five years (1960-2004) of hydrological data from 12 watersheds in
   the Abbay Basin, Ethiopia, were tested for possible trends over the
   entire time series and differences in medians (step-wise changes)
   between three sub-periods. The classification of the sub-periods was
   based on the major political changes in 1975 and 1991. Variables
   investigated were rainfall (P), total flow (Q(t)), high flow (Q(h)), low
   flow (Q(1)), low flow index (LFI) and run-off coefficient (C). Data were
   checked for outliers, errors and homogeneity. Trend was tested after
   serial and cross-correlation tests. The data for each variable were
   serially uncorrelated from 1 to 10 lag years. There were five globally
   significant trends out of 50 test cases and 36 significant step-wise
   changes out of 180 tests. The majority of the significant changes were
   watershed specific. Run-off coefficient was the single variable showing
   a consistently increasing trend and stood for ca. 25 \% of the total
   significant trends and step-wise changes. Half of these changes occurred
   after 1991. We concluded that despite the land use policy changes in
   1975 and 1991, as well as the long-term soil degradation, the
   hydrological regime was quite stable over the 45-year period, with the
   exception of an increase in the run-off coefficient in the latter part
   of the run-off record in some watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Apomixis, asexual reproduction through seeds, occurs in over 40 plant
   families. This widespread phenomenon can lead to the fixation of
   successful genotypes, resulting in a fitness advantage. On the other
   hand, apomicts are expected to lose their fitness advantage if the
   environment changes because of their limited evolutionary potential,
   which is due to low genetic variability and the potential accumulation
   of deleterious somatic mutations. Nonetheless, some apomicts have been
   extremely successful, for example certain apomictic accessions of
   Hieracium pilosella L. from New Zealand, where the plant is invasive.
   Here, we investigate whether the success of these apomictic accessions
   could be due to a fitness advantage by comparing the vegetative
   competitiveness of apomictic H. pilosella from New Zealand with sexual
   accessions of H. pilosella from Europe. Sexual and apomictic plants were
   grown either (A) alone (no competition), (B) in competition with the
   other type (intra-specific competition), (C) in competition with the
   grass Bromus erectus (inter-specific competition), and (D) in
   competition with the other type and the grass B. erectus (intra- and
   inter-specific competition). To distinguish effects of apomixis and the
   region of origin, different H. pilosella lineages were compared.
   Furthermore, experiments were carried out to investigate effects of the
   ploidy level. We show that sexual plants are better inter-specific
   competitors than apomicts in terms of vegetative reproduction (number of
   stolons) and vegetative spread (stolon length), while apomicts do better
   than sexuals in intra-specific competition. The magnitude of the effect
   was in some cases dependent on the ploidy levels of the plants.
   Furthermore, apomicts always produced more stolons than sexuals,
   suggesting potential displacement of sexuals by apomicts where they
   co-occur. (C) 2014 Geobotanisches Institut ETH, Stiftung Ruebel.

Abstract = {{Both the order in which species arrive in a community, and environmental
   conditions, such as temperature, are known to affect community
   structure. Little is known, however, about the potential for, and
   occurrence of, interactions between assembly history and the
   environment. Of particular, interest may be the interaction between
   temperature and community assembly dynamics, especially in the light of
   predicted global climatic change and the fundamental processes that are
   governed, through metabolic rate, by an individual's environmental
   temperature. We present, to our knowledge, the first experimental
   exploration of how the influence of assembly history, temperature, and
   the interaction between the two alters the structure of communities of
   competitors, using small-scale protist microcosm communities where
   temperature and assembly order were manipulated factorially. In our
   experiment, the most important driver of long-term abundance was
   temperature but long-lasting assembly order effects influenced the
   relationship between temperature and abundance. Any advantage of early
   colonization proved to be short-lived, and there was rarely any
   long-term advantage to colonizing a habitat before other species. The
   results presented here suggest that environmental conditions shape
   community composition, but that occasionally temperature could interact
   with the stochastic nature of community assembly to significantly alter
   future community composition, especially where temperature change has
   been large. This could have important implications for the dynamics of
   both rare and invasive species.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: The role of pollen flow within and between
   cultivated and wild tropical crop species is little known. To study the
   pollen flow of cacao, we estimated the degree of self-pollination and
   pollen dispersal distances as well as gene flow between wild and
   cultivated cacao (Theobroma cacao L.).
   Methods: We studied pollen flow and genetic diversity of cultivated and
   wild cacao populations by genotyping 143 wild and 86 cultivated mature
   plants and 374 seedlings raised from 19 wild and 25 cultivated trees at
   nine microsatellite loci.
   Key results: A principal component analysis distinguished wild and
   cultivated cacao trees, supporting the notion that Bolivia harbors truly
   wild cacao populations. Cultivated cacao had a higher level of genetic
   diversity than wild cacao, presumably reflecting the varied origin of
   cultivated plants. Both cacao types had high outcrossing rates, but the
   paternity analysis revealed 7-14\% self-pollination in wild and
   cultivated cacao. Despite the tiny size of the pollinators, pollen was
   transported distances up to 3 km; wild cacao showed longer distances
   (mean = 922 m) than cultivated cacao (826 m). Our data revealed that
   16-20\% of pollination events occurred between cultivated and wild
   populations.
   Conclusions: We found evidence of self-pollination in both wild and
   cultivated cacao. Pollination distances are larger than those typically
   reported in tropical understory tree species. The relatively high pollen
   exchange from cultivated to wild cacao compromises genetic identity of
   wild populations, calling for the protection of extensive natural forest
   tracts to protect wild cacao in Bolivia.}},

Abstract = {{Much public participation research is built on the assumption that
   participatory arrangements empower citizens and disrupt existing power
   structures. This article challenges that claim. Drawing on one
   participatory venue considered most likely to empower citizens in Basel,
   Switzerland, the study shows that meaningful collective power has been
   conferred to citizens. However, resourceful and organisationally
   privileged actors have influenced the impact of citizen's demands on
   public decision-making in significant ways. The study concludes that the
   production and implementation of collective power deriving from citizens
   depends on distributive power sources residing in governments and
   bureaucracies. As a result, participatory arrangements that aim to
   direct state action have to conform to some extent to the rules and
   structures underlying ordinary policy-making. The case study highlights
   the intertwined relationship of the power to' and the power over' and
   shows how the interplay between these two forms of power places
   conditions on the empowering potential of participatory arrangements.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the study was to apply Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectroscopy followed by chemometrical data treatment for the
   differentiation of fungi-infected perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne)

   FTIR was used to rapidly discriminate between leaves of perennial
   ryegrass (L. perenne) infected by a fungal endophyte (Epichloe; asexual
   forms: Neotyphodium) and uninfected leaves. Besides drying and grinding
   of the sampled leaves, no other preparation steps were needed. FTIR
   measurements were performed in the attenuated total reflection (ATR)
   mode. Aliquots of powdered leaf samples were placed on a ZnSe crystal
   and the spectra were collected, followed by chemometrical analysis
   (multidimensional factor analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis).
   ATR-FTIR allowed a rapid detection of fungal infections in the plant
   material and proved to be a fast and reliable tool for the
   differentiation of plant biomass without the need of time-consuming

Volume = {{172}},

Abstract = {{In molecular phylogenetic studies, Lophopyxidaceae and Putranjivaceae
   are well supported as sisters in the large rosid order Malpighiales. As
   the floral structure of both families is poorly known and the two
   families have never been compared, the present comparative study was
   carried out, as part of a larger project on the comparative floral
   structure of Malpighiales, using microtome section series and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) studies. Similar to other angiosperm clades,
   it appears that the structure of the ovules is a strong marker for
   suprafamilial relationships in Malpighiales. Both families have two
   collateral pendant antitropous ovules per carpel associated with
   obturators (as in some Euphorbiaceae s.l., to which Putranjivaceae
   belonged in earlier classifications). However, in contrast with
   Euphorbiaceae s.l., the ovules are not crassinucellar, but either
   incompletely tenuinucellar or only weakly crassinucellar with a long and
   conspicuously slender nucellus and an endothelium, and do not have a
   nucellar beak, but a normal micropyle, features they share with families
   other than Euphorbiaceae s.l. among Malpighiales. Other shared features
   of the two families include the following. The outer sepals tend to be
   smaller than the inner ones and the sepals do not protect the gynoecium
   in older buds. Sepals of some taxa have a single vascular trace. A short
   zone of synsepaly tends to be present. Stamens tend to be antesepalous
   in haplostemonous flowers. A short gynophore is present. The
   synascidiate zone extends up to above the placenta, but is restricted to
   the ovary in taxa with more than one carpel. The micropyle is formed by
   the inner integument. The ventral carpel slits extend down into the
   synascidiate zone as postgenitally fused furrows. The carpels have a
   broad dorsal band of vascular bundles in the style. The overall floral
   structure of the two families corroborates their sister position well
   and does not support the earlier association of Putranjivaceae with
   Euphorbiaceae s.l. or of Lophopyxidaceae with
   Geraniales-Sapindales-Celastrales, which rely on shared superficial
   floral similarities.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical

Abstract = {{There is a debate whether supplemental feeding of deer bears the risk of
   inducing health problems, in particular acidosis. Here, the pH values of
   forestomach contents of free-ranging roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) shot
   in areas with and without supplemental winter feeding were compared. pH
   was similar in the dorsal and ventral rumen, but lower at these sites
   than in the Atrium ruminis, where it was again lower than in the
   reticulum; this pattern corresponds to expectations based on differences
   in the presence of saliva at the different sites of the forestomach. pH
   was lower with increasing time that elapsed between death of the animal
   and measuring pH in unsupplemented animals and was lower in
   unsupplemented animals in May/June than later in the year. Animals with
   supplemental winter feeding had significantly lower rumen pH (5.5) than
   animals without food supplementation (5.7). These data suggest that
   supplemental feeding of roe deer has the potential to lower forestomach
   pH. Although pH values measured in supplemented animals in this study
   would be considered indicative of rumen acidosis in domestic cattle,
   they are within the range previously measured in various free-ranging
   Odocoilid species, including roe deer; were of a similar magnitude as
   the May/June values of unsupplemented roe deer in this study; and must
   be considered with respect to potentially rapid declines in pH between
   death of the animal and pH measurement. Given methodological problems,
   analyses of literature data from free-ranging wild ruminants provide
   little evidence for a systematic variation of rumen pH with feeding type
   and body mass, but lead to the hypothesis that some New World cervids,
   including the roe deer, might either naturally have lower pH values than
   other ruminants or rumen contents whose pH drops rapidly after death.}},

Abstract = {{In 30 years of climate policy in Germany, a high level of declared
   ambition has coexisted with an eclectic mix of climate policy measures.
   Well-organized lobbies were either exempt from policy instruments such
   as the energy tax or directly benefitted from them, as in the case of
   the renewable feed-in tariff or windfall profits from free allocation of
   emissions allowances. As a result, German emissions mitigation is much
   more costly than it would have to be. Moreover, the challenges because
   of the imminent phase-out of nuclear power are increasing due to
   failures in a number of relevant policy fields such as offshore wind,
   grid reinforcement, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). WIREs Clim

Abstract = {{The diet of great apes consists of several hundred plant species. The
   factors determining diet differences have been examined between
   populations but not within a population, probably due to the confounding
   effect of seasonal fluctuations on fruit availability. In Sumatran
   orangutans (Pongo abelii), fruit availability appears to be sufficiently
   high year round to have little influence on diet composition, which in
   turn allows for addressing this question. We examined the diet of eight
   adult female orangutans at Ketambe, Sumatra, and investigated whether
   fig and non-fig fruit availability, association time, and/or home range
   measures influenced dietary overlap between female dyads. Between most
   pairs, females' diets were different: 16 out of 23 pairs had a
   significantly low diet species overlap. Only fig diet overlap was
   influenced (negatively) by the availability of non-fig fruit.
   Association time only influenced (positively) fig diet overlap. Hence,
   orangutans gathered in fig trees when non-fig fruit availability was
   low. Home range measures did not influence overall diet overlap. To our
   knowledge, this is the first study showing that, while controlling for
   confounding factors, individuals with similar energetic requirements,
   from the same population and sharing the same area, make different
   dietary choices relatively to their preferred (non-fig) fruit
   constituting the majority of their diet. Social transmission, with
   putative matrilineal diet traditions, suitably explains these results.
   We discuss the implications of the findings for orangutan conservation,
   namely on reintroduction and the felling of fig trees.}},

Title = {{Independent sources of condition dependency and multiple pathways
   determine a composite trait: lessons from carotenoid-based plumage
   colouration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Many colour ornaments are composite traits consisting of at least four
   components, which themselves may be more complex, determined by
   independent evolutionary pathways, and potentially being under different
   environmental control. To date, little evidence exists that several
   different components of colour elaboration are condition dependent and
   no direct evidence exists that different ornamental components are
   affected by different sources of variation. For example, in
   carotenoid-based plumage colouration, one of the best-known
   condition-dependent ornaments, colour elaboration stems from both
   condition-dependent pigment concentration and structural components.
   Some environmental flexibility of these components has been suggested,
   but specifically which and how they are affected remains unknown. Here,
   we tested whether multiple colour components may be condition dependent,
   by using a comprehensive 3x2 experimental design, in which we carotenoid
   supplemented and immune challenged great tit nestlings (Parus major) and
   quantified effects on different components of colouration. Plumage
   colouration was affected by an interaction between carotenoid
   availability and immune challenge. Path analyses showed that carotenoid
   supplementation increased plumage saturation via feather carotenoid
   concentration and via mechanisms unrelated to carotenoid deposition,
   while immune challenge affected feather length, but not carotenoid
   concentration. Thus, independent condition-dependent pathways, affected
   by different sources of variation, determine colour elaboration. This
   provides opportunities for the evolution of multiple signals within
   components of ornamental traits. This finding indicates that the
   selective forces shaping the evolution of different components of a
   composite trait and the trait's signal content may be more complex than
   believed so far, and that holistic approaches are required for drawing
   comprehensive evolutionary conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{The bioassessment of aquatic ecosystems is currently based on various
   biotic indices that use the occurrence and/or abundance of selected
   taxonomic groups to define ecological status. These conventional indices
   have some limitations, often related to difficulties in morphological
   identification of bioindicator taxa. Recent development of DNA barcoding
   and metabarcoding could potentially alleviate some of these limitations,
   by using DNA sequences instead of morphology to identify organisms and
   to characterize a given ecosystem. In this paper, we review the
   structure of conventional biotic indices, and we present the results of
   pilot metabarcoding studies using environmental DNA to infer biotic
   indices. We discuss the main advantages and pitfalls of metabarcoding
   approaches to assess parameters such as richness, abundance, taxonomic
   composition and species ecological values, to be used for calculation of
   biotic indices. We present some future developments to fully exploit the
   potential of metabarcoding data and improve the accuracy and precision
   of their analysis. We also propose some recommendations for the future
   integration of DNA metabarcoding to routine biomonitoring programs. (C)

Abstract = {{In agricultural and natural systems researchers have demonstrated large
   effects of plant-soil feedback (PSF) on plant growth. However, the
   concepts and approaches used in these two types of systems have
   developed, for the most part, independently. Here, we present a
   conceptual framework that integrates knowledge and approaches from these
   two contrasting systems. We use this integrated framework to demonstrate
   (i) how knowledge from complex natural systems can be used to increase
   agricultural resource-use efficiency and productivity and (ii) how
   research in agricultural systems can be used to test hypotheses and
   approaches developed in natural systems. Using this framework, we
   discuss avenues for new research toward an ecologically sustainable and
   climate-smart future.}},

Title = {{A non-invasive method for sampling the body odour of mammals}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Olfaction is a central aspect of mammalian communication, providing
   information about individual attributes such as identity, sex, group
   membership or genetic quality. Yet, the chemical underpinnings of
   olfactory cues remain little understood, one of the reasons being the
   difficulty in obtaining high quality samples for chemical analysis.
   2. In this study, we adjusted and evaluated the use of thermal
   desorption (TD) tubes, commonly used in plant metabolomic and
   environmental studies, for non-invasive sampling of mammalian body
   odour. We obtained chemical profiles of meerkat (Suricata suricatta)
   body odour samples, using TD tubes analysed with gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry.
   3. TD tubes captured a wide range of volatile and semi-volatile organic
   compounds, including compounds likely originating from the target
   animals. Adjustment of sampling parameters (distance, volume, flow rate,
   interruption of sampling) to increase the feasibility for a non-invasive
   application yielded samples of adequate quality. However, to minimize
   the variability between samples, sampling parameters should be kept
   constant and samples should be collected when no conspecifics are
   close-by.
   4. The method was sensitive enough to pick up population differences in
   the chemical profiles of two captive groups of meerkats, demonstrating
   its applicability to biological questions. With sufficiently habituated
   animals, the method is applicable non-invasively, allowing short- and
   long-term studies on a wide range of questions, including e.g. chemical
   signatures of kinship, diet, individual health or reproductive state.}},

Abstract = {{The end-Permian mass extinction was the most severe biotic crisis in
   Earth's history. In its direct aftermath microbial communities colonized
   some of the space left vacant after the severe decline of skeletal
   metazoans. The Permian-Triassic boundary microbialites were peculiarly
   abundant on low-latitude shallow-marine carbonate shelves of central
   Tethyan continents. Armenia features particularly well preserved and
   diverse basal Triassic sponge-microbial build-ups (BTSMBs), which were
   not studied in detail to date. Here, the Chanakhchi section in southern
   Armenia is described petrographically and by means of stable isotope
   analyses. The Armenian BTSMBs formed in a distally open marine setting
   on a pelagic carbonate ramp in the course of two phases of microbial
   growth during the Induan (Lower Triassic). The BTSMBs are represented by
   predominantly thrombolitic but also dendrolitic and digitate
   stromatolite biostromes and mounds that vary in height between 5 cm to
   12 m. The digitate stromatolites are associated with calcium carbonate
   crystal fans (CCFs). Microfacies analyses revealed that the BTSMBs
   exhibit a number of different growth forms and internal fabrics. The
   formation of CCFs was apparently not devoid of biological influence and
   took place above the sediment surface. The abundance of sponges in the
   BTSMBs reveals that ecologically complex metazoan-microbial reefs have
   been present already early after the end-Permian mass extinction.
   However, the formation of biostromes and mounds did not depend on
   sponges or other metazoans. BTSMBs that formed during the second
   microbial growth phase revealed similar delta C-13-values like the
   surrounding sediment. In contrast, the delta C-13(microbialite) and
   delta C-13(sediment) values from the BTSMBs and CCFs of the first growth
   phase show a difference of up to + 2.3 parts per thousand, suggesting a
   significant influence of photoautotrophy during microbially induced
   carbonate precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{Plant diseases are a serious threat to crop production. The informed use
   of naturally occurring disease resistance in plant breeding can greatly
   contribute to sustainably reduce yield losses caused by plant pathogens.
   The Ta-Lr34res gene encodes an ABC transporter protein and confers
   partial, durable, and broad spectrum resistance against several fungal
   pathogens in wheat. Transgenic barley lines expressing Ta-Lr34res showed
   enhanced resistance against powdery mildew and leaf rust of barley.
   While Ta-Lr34res is only active at adult stage in wheat, Ta-Lr34res was
   found to be highly expressed already at the seedling stage in transgenic
   barley resulting in severe negative effects on growth. Here, we
   expressed Ta-Lr34res under the control of the pathogen-inducible
   Hv-Ger4c promoter in barley. Sixteen independent barley transformants
   showed strong resistance against leaf rust and powdery mildew. Infection
   assays and growth parameter measurements were performed under standard
   glasshouse and near-field conditions using a convertible glasshouse. Two
   Hv-Ger4c::Ta-Lr34res transgenic events were analysed in detail. Plants
   of one transformation event had similar grain production compared to
   wild-type under glasshouse and near-field conditions. Our results showed
   that negative effects caused by constitutive high expression of
   Ta-Lr34res driven by the endogenous wheat promoter in barley can be
   eliminated by inducible expression without compromising disease
   resistance. These data demonstrate that Ta-Lr34res is agronomically

Abstract = {{Some ecologists suggest that trophy hunting (e.g., harvesting males with
   a desirable trait above a certain size) can lead to rapid phenotypic
   change, which has led to an ongoing discussion about evolutionary
   consequences of trophy hunting. Claims of rapid evolution come from the
   statistical analyses of data, with no examination of whether these
   results are theoretically plausible. We constructed simple quantitative
   genetic models to explore how a range of hunting scenarios affects the
   evolution of a trophy such as horn length. We show that trophy hunting
   does lead to trophy evolution defined as change in the mean breeding
   value of the trait. However, the fastest rates of phenotypic change
   attributable to trophy hunting via evolution that are theoretically
   possible under standard assumptions of quantitative genetics are 1-2
   orders of magnitude slower than the fastest rates of phenotypic change
   reported from statistical analyses. Our work suggests a re-evaluation of
   the likely evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting would be
   appropriate when setting policy. Our work does not consider the ethical
   or ecological consequences of trophy hunting. (c) 2017 The Wildlife
   Society.
   We show that the widely cited results claiming rapid evolution of trophy
   size in bighorn sheep in response to selective trophy hunting are
   theoretically impossible given standard assumptions of quantitative
   genetics.}},

Abstract = {{Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid-derived phytohormones shaping plant
   architecture and inducing the symbiosis with endomycorrhizal fungi. In
   Petunia hybrida, SL transport within the plant and towards the
   rhizosphere is driven by the ABCG-class protein PDR1. PDR1 expression is
   regulated by phytohormones and by the soil phosphate abundance, and thus
   SL transport integrates plant development with nutrient conditions.
   We overexpressed PDR1 (PDR1 OE) to investigate whether increased
   endogenous SL transport is sufficient to improve plant nutrition and
   productivity. Phosphorus quantification and nondestructive X-ray
   computed tomography were applied. Morphological and gene expression
   changes were quantified at cellular and whole tissue levels via
   time-lapse microscopy and quantitative PCR.
   PDR1 OE significantly enhanced phosphate uptake and plant biomass
   production on phosphate- poor soils. PDR1 OE plants showed increased
   lateral root formation, extended root hair elongation, faster
   mycorrhization and reduced leaf senescence. PDR1 overexpression allowed
   considerable SL biosynthesis by releasing SL biosynthetic genes from an
   SL-dependent negative feedback.
   The increased endogenous SL transport/biosynthesis in PDR1 OE plants is
   a powerful tool to improve plant growth on phosphate-poor soils. We
   propose PDR1 as an as yet unexplored trait to be investigated for crop
   production. The overexpression of PDR1 is a valuable strategy to
   investigate SL functions and transport routes.}},

Abstract = {{This study is focused on the Guadalete River basin (SW, Spain), where
   extreme weather conditions have become common, with and alternation
   between periods of drought and extreme rainfall events. Combined sewer
   overflows (CSOs) occur when heavy rainfall events exceed the capacity of
   the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), as well as pollution episodes in
   parts of the basin due to uncontrolled sewage spills and the use of
   reclaimed water and sludge from the local WWTP.The sampling was carried
   out along two seasons and three campaigns during dry (March 2007) and
   extreme rainfall (April and December 2010) in the Guadalete River,
   alluvial aquifer and Jerez de la Frontera aquifer.Results showed minimum
   concentrations for synthetic surfactants in groundwater (< 37.4 mu g.L-
   1) during the first campaign (dry weather conditions), whereas
   groundwater contaminants increased in December 2010 as the heavy
   rainfall caused the river to overflow.In surface water, surfactant
   concentrations showed similar trends to groundwater observations.In
   addition to surfactants, pharmaceuticals and personal care products
   (PPCPs) were analyzed in the third campaign, 22 of which were detected
   in surface waters. Two fragrances (OTNE and galaxolide) and one
   analgesic/anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen) were the most abundant PPCPs (up
   to 6540, 2748 and 1747 ng.L-1, respectively).Regarding ground water,
   most PPCPswere detected in Jerez de la Frontera aquifer, where a
   synthetic fragrance (OTNE) was predominant (up to 1285 ng.L-1). (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Satellite data provide a large range of information on glacier dynamics
   and changes. Results are often reported, provided and used without
   consideration of measurement accuracy (difference to a true value) and
   precision (variability of independent assessments). Whereas accuracy
   might be difficult to determine due to the limited availability of
   appropriate reference data and the complimentary nature of satellite
   measurements, precision can be obtained from a large range of measures
   with a variable effort for determination. This study provides a
   systematic overview on the factors influencing accuracy and precision of
   glacier area, elevation change (from altimetry and DEM differencing),
   and velocity products derived from satellite data, along with measures
   for calculating them. A tiered list of recommendations is provided
   (sorted for effort from Level 0 to 3) as a guide for analysts to apply
   what is possible given the datasets used and available to them. The more
   simple measures to describe product quality (Levels 0 and 1) can often
   easily be applied and should thus always be reported. Medium efforts
   (Level 2) require additional work but provide a more realistic
   assessment of product precision. Real accuracy assessment (Level 3)
   requires independent and coincidently acquired reference data with high
   accuracy. However, these are rarely available and their transformation
   into an unbiased source of information is challenging. This overview is
   based on the experiences and lessons learned in the ESA project
   Glaciers\_cci rather than a review of the literature.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many soil remote sensing applications rely on narrow-band observations
   to exploit molecular absorption features. However, broadband sensors are
   invaluable for soil surveying, agriculture, land management and mineral
   exploration, amongst others. These sensors provide denser time series
   compared to high-resolution airborne imaging spectrometers and hold the
   potential of increasing the observable bare-soil area at the cost of
   spectral detail. The wealth of data coming along with these applications
   can be handled using cloud-based processing platforms such as Earth
   Engine. We present a method for identifying the least-vegetated
   observation, or so called barest pixel, in a dense time series between
   January 1985 and March 2017, based on Landsat 5, 7 and 8 observations.
   We derived a Barest Pixel Composite and Bare Soil Composite for the
   agricultural area of the Swiss Plateau. We analysed the available data
   over time and concluded that about five years of Landsat data were
   needed for a full-coverage composite (90\% of the maximum bare soil
   area). Using the Swiss harmonised soil data, we derived soil properties
   (sand, silt, clay, and soil organic matter percentages) and discuss the
   contribution of these soil property maps to existing conventional and
   digital soil maps. Both products demonstrate the substantial potential
   of Landsat time series for digital soil mapping, as well as for land
   management applications and policy making.}},

Abstract = {{Global environmental change has negative impacts on ecological systems,
   impacting the stable provision of functions, goods, and services.
   Whereas effects of individual environmental changes (e.g. temperature
   change or change in resource availability) are reasonably well
   understood, we lack information about if and how multiple changes
   interact. We examined interactions among fourtypes of environmental
   disturbance (temperature, nutrient ratio, carbon enrichment, and light)
   in a fully factorial design using a microbial aquatic ecosystem and
   observed responses of dissolved oxygen saturation at three temporal
   scales (resistance, resilience, and return time). We tested whether
   multiple disturbances combine in a dominant, additive, or interactive
   fashion, and compared the predictability of dissolved oxygen across
   scales. Carbon enrichment and shading reduced oxygen concentration in
   the short term (i.e. resistance); although no other effects or
   interactions were statistically significant, resistance decreased as the
   number of disturbances increased. In the medium term, only enrichment
   accelerated recovery, but none of the other effects (including
   interactions) were significant. In the long term, enrichment and shading
   lengthened return times, and we found significant two-way synergistic
   interactions between disturbances. The best performing model (dominant,
   additive, or interactive) depended on the temporal scale of response. In
   the short term (i.e. for resistance), the dominance model predicted
   resistance of dissolved oxygen best, due to a large effect of carbon
   enrichment, whereas none of the models could predict the medium term
   (i.e. resilience). The long-term response was best predicted by models
   including interactions among disturbances. Our results indicate the
   importance of accounting for the temporal scale of responses when
   researching the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Spatially well-informed decisions are essential to sustain and regulate
   processes and ecosystem services (ES), and to maintain the capacity of
   ecosystems to supply services. However, spatially explicit ES
   information is often lacking in decision-making, or exists only as ES
   maps based on categorical land cover data. Remote sensing (RS) opens new
   pathways to map ES, in particular biophysical ES supply. We developed an
   observation-based concept for spatially explicit and continuous ES
   mapping at landscape scale following the biophysical part of the ES
   cascade. We used Earth observations in combination with in situ data to
   map ecosystem properties, functions, and biophysical ES supply. We
   applied this concept in a case study to map two ES: carbon dioxide
   regulation and food supply. Based on Earth observations and in situ
   data, we determined the ecosystem property Sun-Induced chlorophyll
   Fluorescence (SIF) to indicate ecosystem state and applied scaling
   models to estimate gross primary production (GPP) as indicator for
   ecosystem functioning and consequently carbon dioxide regulation and
   food supply as ES.
   Resulting ES maps showed heterogeneous patterns in ES supply within and
   among ecosystems, which were particularly evident within forests and
   grasslands. All investigated land cover classes were sources of CO2,
   with averages ranging from -66 to -748 g C m(-2) yr(-1), after
   considering the harvest of total above ground biomass of crops and the
   storage organ, except for forest being a sink of CO2 with an average of
   105 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Estimated annual GPP was related to food supply
   with a maize grain yield average of 9.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and a sugar beet
   root yield of 110 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Validation with in situ measurements
   from flux towers and literature values revealed a good performance of
   our approach for food supply (relative RMSE of less than 23\%), but also
   some over- and underestimations for carbon dioxide regulation. Our
   approach demonstrated how RS can contribute to spatially explicit and
   continuous ES cascade mapping and suggest that this information could be
   useful for environmental assessments and decision-making in spatial
   planning and conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Green space may improve health by enabling physical activity and
   recovery from stress or by decreased pollution levels. We investigated
   the association between residential green (greenness or green space) and
   mortality in adults using the Swiss National Cohort (SNC) by mutually
   considering air pollution and transportation noise exposure. To reflect
   residential green at the address level, two different metrics were
   derived: normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) for greenness,
   and high resolution land use classification data to identify green
   spaces (LU-green). We used stratified Cox proportional hazard models
   (stratified by sex) to study the association between exposure and all
   natural cause mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular disease (CVD),
   including ischemic heart disease, stroke and hypertension related
   mortality. Models were adjusted for civil status, job position,
   education, neighbourhood socio-economic position (SEP), geographic
   region, area type, altitude, air pollution (PM10), and transportation
   noise. From the nation-wide SNC, 4.2 million adults were included
   providing 7.8 years of follow-up and respectively 363,553, 85,314 and
   232,322 natural cause, respiratory and CVD deaths. Hazard ratios (and
   95\%-confidence intervals) for NDVI {[}and LU-green] per interquartile
   range within 500 m of residence were highly comparable: 0.94 (0.93-0.95)
   {[}0.94 (0.93-0.95)] for natural causes; 0.92 (0.91-0.94) {[}0.92
   (0.90-0.95)] for respiratory; and 0.95 (0.94-0.96) {[}0.96 (0.95-0.98)]
   for CVD mortality. Protective effects were stronger in younger
   individuals and in women and, for most outcomes, in urban (vs. rural)
   and in the highest (vs. lowest) SEP quartile. Estimates remained
   virtually unchanged after incremental adjustment for air pollution and
   transportation noise, and mediation by these environmental factors was
   found to be small. We found consistent evidence that residential green
   reduced the risk of mortality independently from other environmental
   exposures. This suggests the protective effect goes beyond the absence
   of pollution sources. Environmental public health measures should not
   only aim at reducing pollutant exposure, but additionally maintain
   existing and increase residential green in areas where lacking.}},

Abstract = {{Resource limitation and predation mortality are major determinants of
   microbial population dynamics, and optimization for either aspect is
   considered to imply a trade-off with respect to the other. Adaptation to
   these selective factors may, moreover, lead to disadvantages at rich
   growth conditions. We present an example of a concomitant evolutionary
   optimization to both, substrate limitation and predation in an
   aggregate-forming freshwater bacterial isolate, and we elucidate an
   underlying genomic mechanism. Bacteria were propagated in serial batch
   culture in a nutrient-restricted environment either with or without a
   bacterivorous flagellate. Strains isolated after 26 growth cycles of the
   predator-prey co-cultures formed as much total biomass as the ancestor
   at ancestral growth conditions, albeit largely reallocated to cell
   aggregates. A similar to 273 kbp genome fragment was lost in three
   strains that had independently evolved with predators. These strains had
   significantly higher growth yield on substrate-restricted media than
   others that were isolated from the same treatment before the excision
   event. Under predation pressure, the isolates with the deletion
   outcompeted both, the ancestor and the strains evolved without predators
   even at rich growth conditions. At the same time, genome reduction led
   to a growth disadvantage in the presence of benzoate due to the loss of
   the respective degradation pathway, suggesting that niche constriction
   might be the price for the bidirectional optimization.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsHow do species richness and composition of fern assemblages
   change with elevation and, within elevational belts, in differently
   impacted forest habitats? Is there a relationship between fern
   assemblages and microclimate, both along gradients of elevation and
   disturbance? Which species are most sensitive to habitat disturbance and
   microclimatic changes?
   LocationFrom sea level close to the Gulf of Mexico 81km away in a direct
   line on the eastern slopes of the Cofre de Perote at 3500m, central
   Veracruz, Mexico.
   MethodsWe studied the richness and composition of fern assemblages in
   120 study plots at eight elevations from 20-3500m in three forest types:
   natural forest (NF), disturbed forest (DF) subjected to timber
   extraction and grazing, and secondary forest (SF) regrown after total
   clearance 15-20yr ago. In addition, we measured microclimatic conditions
   in the three forest types at five elevations over a year.
   ResultsFern richness peaked in humid montane forests at mid-elevations
   and was low in the drier habitats at the ends of the gradient. Humid
   montane forests were most sensitive to disturbance, showing increases in
   mean annual temperatures by about 1 degrees C and reduction in relative
   air humidity by about 20\% in DF and SF compared to NF. This was
   together with a reduction in fern species richness of 5-60\% and marked
   changes in species composition. In contrast, drought-deciduous forests
   at low elevations and coniferous forests at high elevations already had
   low humidity and high light intensity in NF and were less affected by
   human impact: their microclimatic conditions and fern assemblages did
   not change markedly in DF and SF.
   ConclusionsThe conservation of much of the humidity-dependent biota
   (ferns and presumably also groups such as bryophytes and amphibians) in
   humid montane forests depends on the protection of natural fragments
   without human disturbance. In contrast, the naturally open forests at
   the ends of the gradient can be subjected to some exploitation while
   conserving much of their fern flora as long as a general forest
   structure is maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic traits do not always respond to selection independently from
   each other and often show correlated responses to selection. The
   structure of a genotype-phenotype map (GP map) determines trait
   covariation, which involves variation in the degree and strength of the
   pleiotropic effects of the underlying genes. It is still unclear, and
   debated, how much of that structure can be deduced from variational
   properties of quantitative traits that are inferred from their genetic
   (co) variance matrix (G-matrix). Here we aim to clarify how the extent
   of pleiotropy and the correlation among the pleiotropic effects of
   mutations differentially affect the structure of a G-matrix and our
   ability to detect genetic constraints from its eigen decomposition. We
   show that the eigenvectors of a G-matrix can be predictive of
   evolutionary constraints when they map to underlying pleiotropic modules
   with correlated mutational effects. Without mutational correlation,
   evolutionary constraints caused by the fitness costs associated with
   increased pleiotropy are harder to infer from evolutionary metrics based
   on a G-matrix's geometric properties because uncorrelated pleiotropic
   effects do not affect traits' genetic correlations. Correlational
   selection induces much weaker modular partitioning of traits' genetic
   correlations in absence then in presence of underlying modular
   pleiotropy.}},

Abstract = {{Since its inception, archaeology has traditionally focused exclusively
   on humans and our direct ancestors. However, recent years have seen
   archaeological techniques applied to material evidence left behind by
   non-human animals. Here, we review advances made by the most prominent
   field investigating past non-human tool use: primate archaeology. This
   field combines survey of wild primate activity areas with ethological
   observations, excavations and analyses that allow the reconstruction of
   past primate behaviour. Because the order Primates includes humans, new
   insights into the behavioural evolution of apes and monkeys also can be
   used to better interrogate the record of early tool use in our own,
   hominin, lineage. This work has recently doubled the set of primate
   lineages with an excavated archaeological record, adding Old World
   macaques and New World capuchin monkeys to chimpanzees and humans, and
   it has shown that tool selection and transport, and discrete site
   formation, are universal among wild stone-tool-using primates. It has
   also revealed that wild capuchins regularly break stone tools in a way
   that can make them difficult to distinguish from simple early hominin
   tools. Ultimately, this research opens up opportunities for the
   development of a broader animal archaeology, marking the end of
   archaeology's anthropocentric era.}},

Abstract = {{Drive genes are genetic elements that manipulate the 50\% ratio of
   Mendelian inheritance in their own favour, allowing them to rapidly
   propagate through populations. The action of drive genes is often
   hidden, making detection and identification inherently difficult. Yet
   drive genes can have profound evolutionary consequences for the
   populations that harbour them: most known drivers are detrimental to
   organismal gamete development, reproduction and survival. In this study,
   we identified the presence of a well-known drive gene called t haplotype
   post hoc in eight replicate selection lines of house mice that had been
   evolving under enforced monandry or polyandry for 20 generations.
   Previous work on these selection lines reported an increase in sperm
   competitive ability in males evolving under polyandry. Here, we show
   that this evolutionary response can be partly attributed to gene drive.
   We demonstrate that drive-carrying males are substantially compromised
   in their sperm competitive ability. As a consequence, we found that t
   frequencies declined significantly in the polyandrous lines while
   remaining at stable, high levels in the monandrous lines. For the first
   time in a vertebrate, we thus provide direct experimental evidence that
   the mating system of a species can have important repercussions on the
   spread of drive genes over evolutionary relevant timescales. Moreover,
   our work highlights how the covert action of drive genes can have major,
   potentially unintended impact on our study systems.}},

Abstract = {{The Karakoram mountain range is well known for its numerous surge-type
   glaciers of which several have recently surged or are still doing so.
   Analysis of multi-temporal satellite images and digital elevation models
   have revealed impressive details about the related changes (e.g., in
   glacier length, surface elevation and flow velocities) and considerably
   expanded the database of known surge-type glaciers. One glacier that has
   so far only been reported as impacted by surging tributaries, rather
   than surging itself, is the 50 km long main trunk of Hispar Glacier in
   the Hunza catchment. We here present the evolution of flow velocities
   and surface features from its 2015/16 surge as revealed from a dense
   time series of SAR and optical images along with an analysis of historic
   satellite images. We observed maximum flow velocities of up to 14 m
   d(-1) (5 km a(-1)) in spring 2015, sudden drops in summer velocities, a
   second increase in winter 2015/16 and a total advance of the surge front
   of about 6 km. During a few months the surge front velocity was much
   higher (about 90 m d(-1)) than the maximum flow velocity. We assume that
   one of its northern tributary glaciers, Yutmaru, initiated the surge at
   the end of summer 2014 and that the variability in flow velocities was
   driven by changes in the basal hydrologic regime (Alaska-type surge). We
   further provide evidence that Hispar Glacier has surged before (around
   1960) over a distance of about 10 km so that it can also be regarded as
   a surge-type glacier.}},

Title = {{Characterizing change points and continuous transitions in movement
   behaviours using wavelet decomposition}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Individual behaviour, that is, the reaction of an organism to
   internal state, conspecifics and individuals of other species as well as
   the environment, is a crucial building block of their ecology. Modern
   tracking techniques produce high-frequency observations of spatial
   positions of animals and accompanying speed and tortuosity measurements.
   However, inferring behavioural modes from movement trajectories remains
   a challenge.
   2. Changes in behavioural modes occur at different temporal and spatial
   scales and may take two forms: abrupt, representing distinct change
   points; or continuous, representing smooth transitions between movement
   modes. The multi-scale nature of these behavioural changes necessitates
   development of methods that can pinpoint behavioural states across
   spatial and temporal scales.
   3. We propose a novel segmentation method based on the discrete wavelet
   transform (DWT), where the movement signal is decomposed into
   low-frequency approximation and high-frequency detail sub-bands to
   screen for behavioural changes at multiple scales. Approximation
   sub-bands characterizes broad changes by taking the continuous
   variations between behavioural modes into account, whereas detail
   sub-bands are employed to detect abrupt, finer scale change points.
   4. We tested the ability of our method to identify behavioural modes in
   simulated trajectories by comparing it to three state-of-the-art methods
   from the literature. We further validated the method using an annotated
   dataset of turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) relating extracted segments
   to the expert knowledge of migratory vs. non-migratory patterns. Our
   results show that the proposed DWT segmentation is more versatile than
   other segmentation methods, as it can be applied to different movement
   parameters, performs better or equally well on the simulated data, and
   correctly identifies behavioural modes identified by the experts. It is
   hence a valuable addition to the toolbox of land managers and
   conservation practitioners to understand the behavioural patterns
   expressed by animals in natural and human-dominated landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Recombination rate is heterogeneous across the genome of various species
   and so are genetic diversity and differentiation as a consequence of
   linked selection. However, we still lack a clear picture of the
   underlying mechanisms for regulating recombination. Here we estimated
   fine-scale population recombination rate based on the patterns of
   linkage disequilibrium across the genomes of multiple populations of two
   closely related flycatcher species (Ficedula albicollis and F.
   hypoleuca). This revealed an overall conservation of the recombination
   landscape between these species at the scale of 200 kb, but we also
   identified differences in the local rate of recombination despite their
   recent divergence (<1 million years). Genetic diversity and
   differentiation were associated with recombination rate in a
   lineage-specific manner, indicating differences in the extent of linked
   selection between species. We detected 400-3,085 recombination hotspots
   per population. Location of hotspots was conserved between species, but
   the intensity of hotspot activity varied between species. Recombination
   hotspots were primarily associated with CpG islands (CGIs), regardless
   of whether CGIs were at promoter regions or away from genes.
   Recombination hotspots were also associated with specific transposable
   elements (TEs), but this association appears indirect due to shared
   preferences of the transposition machinery and the recombination
   machinery for accessible open chromatin regions. Our results suggest
   that CGIs are a major determinant of the localization of recombination
   hotspots, and we propose that both the distribution of TEs and
   fine-scale variation in recombination rate may be associated with the
   evolution of the epigenetic landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Most spatial ecology focuses on how species dispersal affects community
   dynamics and coexistence. Ecosystems, however, are also commonly
   connected by flows of resources. We experimentally tested how
   neighbouring communities indirectly influence each other in absence of
   dispersal, via resource exchanges. Using two-patch microcosm
   meta-ecosystems, we manipulated community composition and dynamics, by
   varying separately species key functional traits (autotroph versus
   heterotroph species and size of consumer species) and trophic structure
   of aquatic communities (species growing alone or in presence of
   competitors or predators). We then analysed the effects of species
   functional traits and trophic structure on communities connected through
   spatial subsidies in the absence of actual dispersal. Both functional
   traits and trophic structure strongly affected dynamics across
   neighbouring communities. Heterotroph communities connected to autotroph
   neighbours developed better than with heterotroph neighbours, such that
   coexistence of competitors was determined by the functional traits of
   the neighbouring community. Densities in autotroph communities were also
   strikingly higher when receiving subsidies from heterotroph communities
   compared to their own subsidies when grown in isolated ecosystems. In
   contrast, communities connected to predator-dominated ecosystems
   collapsed, without any direct contact with the predators. Our results
   demonstrate that because community composition and structure modify the
   distribution of biomass within a community, they may also affect
   communities connected through subsidies through quantitative and
   qualitative changes of detritus flows. This stresses that ecosystem
   management should account for such interdependencies mediated by spatial
   subsidies, given that local community alterations cascade across space
   onto other ecosystems even if species dispersal is completely absent.}},

Abstract = {{1. Climate warming is faster in the Arctic than the global average.
   Nutrient availability in the tundra soil is expected to increase by
   climate warming through (i) accelerated nutrient mobilization in the
   surface soil layers, and (ii) increased thawing depths during the
   growing season which increases accessibility of nutrients in the deeper
   soil layers. Both processes may initiate shifts in tundra vegetation
   composition. It is important to understand the effects of these two
   processes on tundra plant functional types.
   2. We manipulated soil thawing depth and nutrient availability at a
   Northeast-Siberian tundra site to investigate their effects on above-
   and below-ground responses of four plant functional types (grasses,
   sedges, deciduous shrubs and evergreen shrubs). Seasonal thawing was
   accelerated with heating cables at c. 15 cm depth without warming the
   surface soil, whereas nutrient availability was increased in the surface
   soil by adding slow-release NPK fertilizer at c. 5 cm depth. A
   combination of these two treatments was also included. This is the first
   field experiment specifically investigating the effects of accelerated
   thawing in tundra ecosystems.
   3. Deep soil heating increased the above-ground biomass of sedges, the
   deepest rooted plant functional type in our study, but did not affect
   biomass of the other plant functional types. In contrast, fertilization
   increased above-ground biomass of the two dwarf shrub functional types,
   both of which had very shallow root systems. Grasses showed the
   strongest response to fertilization, both above-and below-ground.
   Grasses were deep-rooted, and they showed the highest plasticity in
   terms of vertical root distribution, as grass root distribution shifted
   to deep and surface soil in response to deep soil heating and surface
   soil fertilization respectively.
   4. Synthesis. Our results indicate that increased thawing depth can only
   benefit deep-rooted sedges, while the shallow-rooted dwarf shrubs, as
   well as flexible-rooted grasses, take advantage of increased nutrient
   availability in the upper soil layers. Our results suggest that grasses
   have the highest root plasticity, which enables them to be more
   competitive in rapidly changing environments. We conclude that root
   vertical distribution strategies are important for vegetation responses
   to climate-induced increases in soil nutrient availability in Arctic
   tundra, and that future shifts in vegetation composition will depend on
   the balance between changes in thawing depth and nutrient availability
   in the surface soil.}},

Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Populations with phenotypic polymorphism in
   discrete characters may be good models for investigating genome
   evolution and speciation. Sphagnum magellanicum Brid. is found
   throughout the northern hemisphere, and despite considerable variation
   in morphological characters, it is considered one of the least
   taxonomically controversial peatmoss species. We have observed two main
   morphs of the species associated with different microhabitats. Here we
   investigated the genomic and environmental basis of this intraspecific
   morphological variation.
   METHODS: We conducted transplant and common garden experiments to test
   whether the two morphs are genetically differentiated. We then used
   RAD-sequencing to quantify the genomic divergence between the morphs and
   approximate Bayesian computation ( ABC) to infer the most likely
   demographic scenario explaining the genome-wide differentiation of the
   two morphs.
   KEY RESULTS: We found that genomic differentiation between the two
   morphs is unexpectedly high and that several of the differentiated
   morphological characters have a genetic basis. Using simulation
   approaches, we found support for a scenario of ancient divergence
   followed by recent secondary contact.
   CONCLUSIONS: We show that the two morphs represent the two main genetic
   clusters previously found worldwide. Our results demonstrate that
   relatively minor morphological differentiation in a presumed
   phenotypically plastic peatmoss may be associated with massive
   divergence across the genome.}},

Abstract = {{Echiteae (Apocynaceae) comprises about 200 species divided among 19
   genera, 16 of which are restricted to the Neotropics, the other 3 to the
   Paleotropics. There are two large genera, Prestonia and Parsonsia, in
   the Neotropics and Paleotropics, respectively, whereas three-fourths of
   the genera contain only one to four species. In this study DNA of 82
   species was extracted and amplified for four molecular markers: three
   plastid (trnL intron + trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, rpl16 intron, matK +
   5'/ 3' trnK intron) and the nuclear ribosomal region ITS. The ingroup
   comprised 70 species from 17 genera in the tribe, and included
   representatives of all subtribes; the outgroup included 5 species each
   from the two putatively most closely related tribes, Odontadenieae and
   Mesechiteae, as well as 2 rooting species. Phylogenetic analyses were
   conducted using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood approaches.
   Echiteae and four of its subtribes (Echitinae, Parsonsiinae,
   Peltastinae, Prestoniinae) as currently circumscribed were shown to be
   non-monophyletic. The fifth subtribe, Pentalinoninae, though
   monophyletic, does not belong to Echiteae; it was resolved as sister to
   a clade of Odontadenieae, where it fits better, since in both the
   characteristic secondary compounds are cardenolides. Prestonia and
   Temnadenia were resolved as polyphyletic, with P. riedelii grouped with
   Rhodocalyx and T. ornata nested within Prestonia. Fernaldia is nested
   within Echites and Peltastes is nested in Macropharynx. Fourteen genera
   are maintained. The new subtribe Laubertiinae is proposed, as are the
   combinations resulting from the merging of Fernaldia and Peltastes and
   the transfer of P. riedelii and T. ornata to Rhodocalyx and Prestonia,
   respectively. In the ancestors of Echiteae, we hypothesize that an
   evolutionary shift took place in which steroidal alkaloids and/or
   cardenolides, characteristic for apocynoids, were replaced by
   parsonsine-type pyrrolizidine alkaloids as the predominant defense
   compounds.}},

Abstract = {{One of the predicted consequences of climate change is a shift in body
   mass distributions within animal populations. Yet body mass, an
   important component of the physiological state of an organism, can
   affect key life-history traits and consequently population dynamics.
   Over the past decades, the wandering albatross a pelagic seabird
   providing bi-parental care with marked sexual size dimorphism has
   exhibited an increase in average body mass and breeding success in
   parallel with experiencing increasing wind speeds. To assess the impact
   of these changes, we examined how body mass affects five key
   life-history traits at the individual level: adult survival, breeding
   probability, breeding success, chick mass and juvenile survival. We
   found that male mass impacted all traits examined except breeding
   probability, whereas female mass affected none. Adult male survival
   increased with increasing mass. Increasing adult male mass increased
   breeding success and mass of sons but not of daughters. Juvenile male
   survival increased with their chick mass. These results suggest that a
   higher investment in sons by fathers can increase their inclusive
   fitness, which is not the case for daughters. Our study highlights
   sex-specific differences in the effect of body mass on the life history
   of a monogamous species with bi-parental care.}},

Abstract = {{Field spectroradiometers are often comprised of several spectral
   detectors to sample the full range of reflected solar irradiance. An
   example of such an instrument is the Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD)
   full-range spectroradiometer, featuring three spectral detectors to
   capture spectra between 350 and 2500 nm. The resulting spectra often
   exhibit radiometric steps at the joints of these detectors. This study
   investigates the influence of external temperature and humidity on the
   magnitude of these steps by experiments based on a climate chamber.
   Relative radiometric errors at the detector borders were found to reach
   up to 16\% for the visible and near infrared and 21\% for the shortwave
   infrared 2 (SWIR2), whereas relative reflectance errors are target
   dependent, typically ranging between 2\% and 6\%. The derived sensor
   model provides a physically based explanation of the changes in
   radiometry due to temperature and demonstrates that all spectral bands
   are affected to a higher or lesser degree. The model can be used to
   correct for the effect of temperature on the recorded radiances.
   Applying the model to ASD instruments that were not tested in the
   climate chamber still leads to reasonable correction results with RMSE
   values of 0.6\%.}},

Abstract = {{The stress-gradient hypothesis predicts a higher frequency of
   facilitative interactions as resource limitation increases. Under severe
   resource limitation, it has been suggested that facilitation may revert
   to competition, and identifying the presence as well as determining the
   magnitude of this shift is important for predicting the effect of
   climate change on biodiversity and plant community dynamics. In this
   study, we perform a meta-analysis to compare temporal differences of
   species diversity and productivity under a nurse plant (Retama
   sphaerocarpa) with varying annual rainfall quantity to test the effect
   of water limitation on facilitation. Furthermore, we assess spatial
   differences in the herbaceous community under nurse plants in situ
   during a year with below-average rainfall. We found evidence that severe
   rainfall deficit reduced species diversity and plant productivity under
   nurse plants relative to open areas. Our results indicate that the
   switch from facilitation to competition in response to rainfall quantity
   is nonlinear. The magnitude of this switch depended on the aspect around
   the nurse plant. Hotter south aspects under nurse plants resulted in
   negative effects on beneficiary species, while the north aspect still
   showed facilitation. Combined, these results emphasize the importance of
   spatial heterogeneity under nurse plants for mediating species loss
   under reduced precipitation, as predicted by future climate change
   scenarios. However, the decreased water availability expected under
   climate change will likely reduce overall facilitation and limit the
   role of nurse plants as refugia, amplifying biodiversity loss.}},

Abstract = {{Field spectroscopy is increasingly used in various fields of science:
   either as a research tool in its own right or in support of airborne-or
   space-based optical instruments for calibration or validation purposes.
   Yet, while the use of the instruments appears deceptively simple, the
   processes of light and surface interactions are complex to be measured
   in full and are further complicated by the multidimensionality of the
   measurement process. This study exemplifies the cross validation of in
   situ point spectroscopy and airborne imaging spectroscopy data across
   all processing stages within the spectroscopy information hierarchy
   using data from an experiment focused on vegetation. In support of this
   endeavor, this study compiles the fundamentals of spectroscopy, the
   challenges inherent to field and airborne spectroscopy, and the best
   practices proposed by the field spectroscopy community. This combination
   of theory and case study shall enable the reader to develop an
   understanding of 1) some of the commonly involved sources of errors and
   uncertainties, 2) the techniques to collect high-quality spectra under
   natural illumination conditions, and 3) the importance of appropriate
   metadata collection to increase the long-term usability and value of
   spectral data.}},

Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Secondary sexual traits have high heritabilities and are exposed to
   strong, environmentally sensitive selection, and so are expected to
   evolve rapidly in response to sustained environmental change. We examine
   the eco-evolutionary dynamics of ornament expression in a long-term
   study population of collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, in which
   forehead patch size, which positively influences male reproductive
   success, declined markedly over 34 years. Annual fitness selection on
   forehead patch size switched from positive to negative during the study,
   a reversal that is accounted for by rising spring temperatures at the
   breeding site: highly ornamented males were selectively favoured
   following cold breeding seasons but selected against following warm
   breeding seasons. An `individual animal model' describes a decline in
   the genetic values of breeding males during the study, which simulations
   showed was unlikely to result from drift alone. These results are thus
   consistent with adaptive evolution of a sexually selected trait in
   response to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{1. Estimating the similarity in space use (spatio-temporal home range
   overlap) of animals is important for many questions regarding
   behavioural ecology, wildlife management and conservation. The current
   methods that calculate joint space use generally do not account for
   proximity in space use, as all of them rely on the differences between
   the exact spatial overlay of utilization distributions, while spatial
   distances between distributions should be considered to truly quantify
   similarity. We implemented the earth mover's distance (EMD), a spatially
   explicit method, that quantifies similarity between utilization
   distributions by calculating the effort it takes to shape one
   utilization distribution landscape into another, hence EMD. The EMD is a
   method commonly used in image retrieval applications, and we propose its
   use to calculate similarity in space use in the framework of movement
   ecology. We show that the EMD is a consistent and useful as well as
   versatile measure of overlap and provide an easy to use implementation
   in the r package move.}},

Abstract = {{Conditions experienced by individuals during prenatal development can
   have long-term effects on their phenotype. Maternally transmitted
   resources are important mediators of such prenatal effects, but the
   potential interactive effects among them in shaping offspring phenotype
   have never been studied. Maternally derived testosterone is known to
   stimulate growth, but these benefits may be counterbalanced by an
   increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Maternally
   transmitted carotenoids might have the capacity to scavenge ROS and
   thereby buffer an increase in oxidative stress caused by prenatal
   exposure to high testosterone levels. Here, we experimentally tested for
   such interactive effects between maternal yolk testosterone and
   carotenoid in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). We found that hatching
   mass was reduced and reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) levels at the
   end of the period of maximal growth increased in chicks from eggs
   injected with either testosterone or carotenoid (only a tendency in
   chicks from testosterone-injected eggs). However, when both egg
   compounds were manipulated simultaneously, hatching mass and ROM levels
   were not affected, showing that both carotenoid and testosterone lose
   their detrimental effects when the ratio between the 2 compounds is
   balanced. Our study provides the first experimental evidence for
   interactive effects of 2 maternally derived egg compounds on offspring
   phenotype and suggests that developmental cues are tightly coadjusted
   within an egg.}},

Abstract = {{Agroecosystems play an important role in providing economic and
   ecosystem services, which directly impact society. Inappropriate land
   use and unsustainable agricultural management with associated nutrient
   cycles can jeopardize important soil functions such as food production,
   livestock feeding, and conservation of biodiversity. The objective of
   this study was to integrate remotely sensed land cover information into
   a regional land management model (LMM) to improve the assessment of
   spatially explicit nutrient balances for agroecosystems. Remotely sensed
   data and an optimized parameter set contributed to an improved LMM
   output, allowing for a better land allocation within the model. The best
   input parameter combination was based on two different land cover
   classifications with overall accuracies of 98\%, improving the land
   allocation performance compared with using nonspatially explicit input.
   We conclude that the combined use of remote sensing data and the LMM has
   the potential to provide valuable guidance for farm practices. It
   further helps to generate a spatial description of farm-level nutrient
   balance, a crucial ability when choosing policy options related to
   sustainable management of agricultural soils.}},

Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2789-2808}},

Abstract = {{In many birds, males are presumed to protect their paternity by closely
   guarding their mate or copulating frequently with her. Both these costly
   behaviors are assumed to reduce the risk and/or intensity of sperm
   competition. However, despite many studies on avian extra-pair
   paternity, it remains unclear how strongly these behaviors are related
   to fitness and other key life-history traits. Here, we conduct
   meta-analyses to address two questions. First, are mate guarding and/or
   frequent copulation positively correlated with a male's share of
   paternity at his nest? We find a significant positive correlation
   between both presumed paternity protection behaviors and paternity
   share. The relationship is, however, weak (r = 0.08-0.23). This is
   perhaps unsurprising if the risk of partner infidelity, hence the need
   to protect paternity, varies among males. For example, more attractive
   males might have less need to protect their paternity. Second, do males
   with higher indices of so-called male ``quality{''} (phenotypic
   measures, usually subjectively defined by researchers as predictors of
   male attractiveness) exhibit lower levels of paternity protection
   behavior? We find a negative correlation between male quality and
   paternity protection. This finding might partly explain the weak
   relationship between paternity protection and paternity, although we
   discuss other, nonmutually exclusive possibilities.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Accurate spectral calibration of satellite and airborne spectrometers is
   essential for remote sensing applications that rely on accurate
   knowledge of center wavelength (CW) positions and slit function
   parameters (SFP). We present a new in-flight spectral calibration
   algorithm that retrieves CWs and SFPs across a wide spectral range by
   fitting a high-resolution solar spectrum and atmospheric absorbers to
   in-flight radiance spectra. Using a maximum a posteriori optimal
   estimation approach, the quality of the fit can be improved with a
   priori information. The algorithm was tested with synthetic spectra and
   applied to data from the APEX imaging spectrometer over the spectral
   range of 385-870 nm. CWs were retrieved with high accuracy (uncertainty
   <0.05 spectral pixels) from Fraunhofer lines below 550 nm and
   atmospheric absorbers above 650 nm. This enabled a detailed
   characterization of APEX's across-track spectral smile and a previously
   unknown along-track drift. The FWHMs of the slit function were also
   retrieved with good accuracy (<10\% uncertainty) for synthetic spectra,
   while some obvious misfits appear for the APEX spectra that are likely
   related to radiometric calibration issues. In conclusion, our algorithm
   significantly improves the in-flight spectral calibration of APEX and
   similar spectrometers, making them better suited for the retrieval of
   atmospheric and surface variables relying on accurate calibration.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Remote sensing data allow large scale observation of forested
   ecosystems. Forest assessment benefits from information about individual
   trees. Multibaseline SAR interferometry (InSAR) is able to generate
   dense point clouds of forest canopies, similar to airborne laser
   scanning (ALS). This type of point cloud was generated using data from
   the Ka-band MEMPHIS system, acquired over a mainly coniferous forest
   near Vordemwald in the Swiss Midlands. This point cloud was segmented
   using an advanced clustering technique to detect individual trees and
   derive their positions, heights, and crown diameters. To evaluate the
   InSAR point cloud properties and limitations, it was compared to
   products derived from ALS and stereo-photogrammetry. All point clouds
   showed similar geolocation accuracies with 02-0.3 m relative shifts.
   Both InSAR and photogrammetry techniques yielded points predominantly
   located in the upper levels of the forest vegetation, while ALS provided
   points from the top of the canopy down to the understory and forest
   floor. The canopy height models agreed very well with each other, with
   R-2 values between 0.84 and 0.89. The detected trees and their estimated
   physical and structural parameters were validated by comparing them to
   reference forestry data. A detection rate of similar to 90\% was
   achieved for larger trees, corresponding to half of the reference trees.
   The smaller trees were detected with a success rate of similar to 50\%.
   The tree height was slightly underestimated, with a R-2 value of 0.63.
   The estimated crown diameter agreed on an average sense, however with a
   relatively low R-2 value of 0.19. Very high success rates (>90\%) were
   obtained when matching the trees detected from the InSAR-data with those
   detected from the ALS- and photogrammetry-data. There, InSAR tree
   heights were in the mean 1-1.5 m lower, with high R-2 values ranging
   between 0.8 and 0.9. Our results demonstrate the use of millimeter wave
   SAR interferometry data as an alternative to ALS- and
   photogrammetry-based data for forest monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The seasonal dominance of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton community
   of lake ecosystems can have severe implications for higher trophic
   levels. For herbivorous zooplankton such as Daphnia, cyanobacteria have
   poor nutritional value and some species can produce toxins affecting
   zooplankton survival and reproduction. Here we present another, hitherto
   largely unexplored aspect of cyanobacteria, namely that they can
   increase Daphnia susceptibility to parasites. In a 12-yr monthly
   time-series analysis of the Daphnia community in Greifensee
   (Switzerland), we observed that cyanobacteria density correlated
   significantly with the epidemics of a common gut parasite of Daphnia,
   Caullerya mesnili, regardless of what cyanobacteria species was present
   or whether it was colonial or filamentous. The temperature from the
   previous month also affected the occurrence of Caullerya epidemics,
   either directly or indirectly by the promotion of cyanobacterial growth.
   A laboratory experiment confirmed that cyanobacteria increase the
   susceptibility of Daphnia to Caullerya, and suggested a possible
   involvement of cyanotoxins or other chemical traits of cyanobacteria in
   this process. These findings expand our understanding of the
   consequences of toxic cyanobacterial blooms for lake ecosystems and
   might be relevant for epidemics experienced by other aquatic species.}},

Title = {{Lost crops of the Incas: Origins of domestication of the Andean pulse
   crop tarwi, Lupinus mutabilis}},

Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The Andean highlands are a hotspot of
   domestication, yet our understanding of the origins of early Andean
   agriculture remains fragmentary. Key questions of where, when, how many
   times, and from what progenitors many Andean crops were domesticated
   remain unanswered. The Andean lupine crop tarwi (Lupinus mutabilis) is a
   regionally important pulse crop with exceptionally high seed protein and
   oil content and is the focus of modern breeding efforts, but its origins
   remain obscure.
   METHODS: A large genome-wide DNA polymorphism data set was generated
   using nextRADseq to infer relationships among more than 200 accessions
   of Andean Lupinus species, including 24 accessions of L. mutabilis and
   close relatives. Phylogenetic and demographic analyses were used to
   identify the likely progenitor of tarwi and elucidate the area and
   timing of domestication in combination with archaeological evidence.
   KEY RESULTS: We infer that tarwi was domesticated once in northern Peru,
   most likely in the Cajamarca region within, or adjacent to the extant
   distribution of L. piurensis, which is the most likely wild progenitor.
   Demographic analyses suggest that tarwi split from L. piurensis around
   2600 BP and suffered a classical domestication bottleneck. The earliest
   unequivocal archaeological evidence of domesticated tarwi seeds is from
   the Mantaro Valley, central Peru ca. 1800 BP.
   CONCLUSIONS: A single origin of tarwi from L. piurensis in northern Peru
   provides a robust working hypothesis for the domestication of this
   regionally important crop and is one of the first clear-cut examples of
   a crop originating in the highlands of northern Peru.}},

Abstract = {{Understory herbs and soil invertebrates play key roles in soil formation
   and nutrient cycling in forests. Studies suggest that diversity in the
   canopy and in the understory are positively associated, but these
   studies often confound the effects of tree species diversity with those
   of tree species identity and abiotic conditions. We combined extensive
   field sampling with structural equation modeling to evaluate the
   simultaneous effects of tree diversity on the species diversity of
   understory herbs, beetles, and earthworms. The diversity of earthworms
   and saproxylic beetles was directly and positively associated with tree
   diversity, presumably because species of both these taxa specialize on
   certain species of trees. Tree identity also strongly affected diversity
   in the understory, especially for herbs, likely as a result of
   interspecific differences in canopy light transmittance or litter
   decomposition rates. Our results suggest that changes in forest
   management will disproportionately affect certain understory taxa. For
   instance, changes in canopy diversity will affect the diversity of
   earthworms and saproxylic beetles more than changes in tree species
   composition, whereas the converse would be expected for understory herbs
   and detritivorous beetles. We conclude that the effects of tree
   diversity on understory taxa can vary from positive to negative and may
   affect biogeochemical cycling in temperate forests. Thus, maintaining
   high diversity in temperate forests can promote the diversity of
   multiple taxa in the understory.}},

Abstract = {{OsMADS1 controls rice (Oryza sativa) floral fate and organ development.
   Yet, its genome-wide targets and the mechanisms underlying its role as a
   transcription regulator controlling developmental gene expression are
   unknown. We identify 3112 gene-associated OsMADS1-bound sites in the
   floret genome. These occur in the vicinity of transcription start sites,
   within gene bodies, and in intergenic regions. Majority of the bound DNA
   contained CArG motif variants or, in several cases, only A-tracts.
   Sequences flanking the binding peak had a higher AT nucleotide content,
   implying that broader DNA structural features may define in planta
   binding. Sequences for binding by other transcription factor families
   like MYC, AP2/ERF, bZIP, etc. are enriched in OsMADS1-bound DNAs. Target
   genes implicated in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cellular
   processes, and hormone metabolism were enriched. Combining expression
   data from OsMADS1 knockdown florets with these DNA binding data, a
   snapshot of a gene regulatory network was deduced where targets, such as
   AP2/ERF and bHLH transcription factors and chromatin remodelers form
   nodes. We show that the expression status of these nodal factors can be
   altered by inducing the OsMADS1-GR fusion protein and present a model
   for a regulatory cascade where the direct targets of OsMADS1,
   OsbHLH108/SPT, OsERF034, and OsHSF24, in turn control genes such as
   OsMADS32 and OsYABBY5. This cascade, with other similar relationships,
   cumulatively contributes to floral organ development. Overall, OsMADS1
   binds to several regulatory genes and, probably in combination with
   other factors, controls a gene regulatory network that ensures rice
   floret development.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of global changes, the long-term viability of populations
   of endangered ectotherms may depend on their adaptive potential and
   ability to cope with temperature variations. We measured responses of
   Atlantic salmon embryos from four populations to temperature variations
   and used a Q(ST)-F-ST approach to study the adaptive divergence among
   these populations. Embryos were reared under two experimental
   conditions: a low temperature regime at 4 degrees C until eyed-stage and
   10 degrees C until the end of embryonic development and a high
   temperature regime with a constant temperature of 10 degrees C
   throughout embryonic development. Significant variations among
   populations and populationxtemperature interactions were observed for
   embryo survival, incubation time and length. Q(ST) was higher than F-ST
   in all but one comparison suggesting an important effect of divergent
   selection. Q(ST) was also higher under the high-temperature treatment
   than at low temperature for length and survival due to a higher variance
   among populations under the stressful warmer treatment. Interestingly,
   heritability was lower for survival under high temperature in relation
   to a lower additive genetic variance under that treatment. Overall,
   these results reveal an adaptive divergence in thermal plasticity in
   embryonic life stages of Atlantic salmon suggesting that salmon
   populations may differentially respond to temperature variations induced
   by climate change. These results also suggest that changes in
   temperature may alter not only the adaptive potential of natural
   populations but also the selection regimes among them.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptomonadales have acquired their plastids by secondary endosymbiosis.
   A novel cladeCRY1has been discovered at the base of the Cryptomonadales
   tree, but it remains unknown whether it contains plastids.
   Cryptomonadales are also an important component of phytoplankton
   assemblages. However, they cannot be readily identified in fixed
   samples, and knowledge on dynamics and distribution of specific taxa is
   scarce. We investigated the phenology of the CRY1 lineage, three
   cryptomonadales clades and a species Proteomonas sulcata in a brackish
   lagoon of the Baltic Sea (salinity 0.3-3.9) using fluorescence insitu
   hybridization. A newly design probe revealed that specimens of the CRY1
   lineage were aplastidic. This adds evidence against the chromalveolate
   hypothesis, and suggests that the evolution of cryptomonadales' plastids
   might have been shorter than is currently assumed. The CRY1 lineage was
   the most abundant cryptomonad clade in the lagoon. All of the studied
   cryptomonads peaked in spring at the most freshwater station, except for
   P.sulcata that peaked in summer and autumn. Salinity and concentration
   of dissolved inorganic nitrogen most significantly affected their
   distribution and dynamics. Our findings contribute to the ecology and
   evolution of cryptomonads, and may advance understanding of evolutionary
   relationships within the eukaryotic tree of life.}},

Abstract = {{Hunting is a common component in the management of ungulate species.
   Despite its widespread use, the influence of selective harvesting on
   phenotypic trait change is still ambiguous, and represents a critical
   gap in our understanding of the responses of wild populations under
   harvest. Using the long-term red deer (Cervus elaphus) dataset
   (1972-2012) from the Isle of Rum National Nature Reserve, Scotland, we
   assessed the relationship between antler length and key demographic
   processes (i.e., survival, recruitment, antler growth, parent-offspring
   trait correlation) for the male component of the population. We then
   constructed the first integral projection model for this species to
   examine the effects of simulated trophy hunting on 2 population-level
   parameters: the stable antler size distribution and the relative
   reproductive value of males. When male mortality rates due to hunting
   were <20\%, the effect on antler size distribution and the reproductive
   value function were relatively small. However, as mortality due to
   hunting increased to 50\% in large individuals, the direct effects of
   hunting on mean antler size and reproductive value became evident. Our
   model acts as a useful starting point to investigate the ecological and
   evolutionary consequences of hunting in red deer. (c) 2016 The Wildlife

Title = {{Evolution of opercle bone shape along a macrohabitat gradient: species
   identification using mtDNA and geometric morphometric analyses in
   neotropical sea catfishes (Ariidae)}},

Abstract = {{Transitions between the marine and freshwater macrohabitat have occurred
   repeatedly in the evolution of teleost fishes. For example, ariid
   catfishes have moved from freshwater to marine environments, and vice
   versa. Opercles, a skeletal feature that has been shown to change during
   such transitions, were subjected to 2D geometric morphometric analyses
   in order to investigate evolutionary shape changes during habitat
   transition in ariid catfishes and to test the influence of habitat on
   shape changes. A mtDNA marker, which proved useful in previous studies,
   was used to verify species identities. It greatly improved the
   assignment of specimens to a species, which are difficult to assign by
   morphology alone. The application of a mtDNA marker confirmed the
   occurrence of Notarius biffi in Central America, South of El Salvador.
   Molecular identification together with principal component analysis
   (PCA) and further morphological inspection of neurocrania indicated the
   existence of a cryptic species within Bagre pinnimaculatus. Principal
   component (PC) scores of individual specimens clustered in morphospace
   by genus rather than by habitat. Strong phylogenetic structure was
   detected using a permutation test of PC scores of species means on a
   phylogenetic tree. Calculation of Pagel's lambda suggested that opercle
   shape evolved according to a Brownian model of evolution. Yet canonical
   variate analysis (CVA) conducted on the habitat groups showed
   significant differences in opercle shapes among freshwater and marine
   species. Overall, opercle shape in tropical American Ariidae appears to
   be phylogenetically constrained. This verifies the application of
   opercle shape as a taxonomic tool for species identification in fossil
   ariid catfishes. At the same time, adaptation to freshwater habitats
   shows characteristic opercle shape trajectories in ariid catfishes,
   which might be used to detect habitat preferences in fossils.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   polarimetry (Pol-SAR) and a supervised classification technique, support
   vector machine (SVM), for the classification of bare soil, ice, and
   snow, over the Ortles-Cevedale massif, (Eastern Italian Alps). We
   analyzed the importance of topographic correction on the backscattering
   and polarimetric SAR signature and the advantage of quad-pol with
   respect to dual-pol data. When backscattering values only are employed,
   the incidence angle used as input feature of the SVM classifier assures
   the best classification accuracy, 9.9\% higher than the accuracy
   obtained with cosine corrected gamma(0) backscattering. The introduction
   of polarimetric features and decomposition parameters (such as
   Cloude-Pottier or Touzi decomposition parameters) increases the
   classification accuracy by 5.2\% with respect to the backscattering
   case. The simulation of RADARSAT-2 data as Sentinel-1 like for dual-pol
   data shows a decrease of accuracy equal to 7.8\% with respect to the
   fully polarimetric case (93.5\%). The first Sentinel-1 image acquired on
   our test area was also employed for classification. We then tested the
   capability of C-band SAR to detect accumulation and ablation zones of
   the glaciers under the winter dry snow by setting up a multi-incidence
   angle and fully polarimetric SVM classifier, exploiting ascending and
   descending RADARSAT-2 data. In this case, the accuracy increased by
   14.7\% combining different geometric acquisitions (88.9\%) with respect
   to the single geometry case. Finally, from the resulting classification
   maps, we extracted the snowline altitude for a sample of three glaciers,
   using both optical and SAR data, comparing the different products.}},

Abstract = {{Taxonomic delimitation within the Andean Festuca setifolia complex s. l.
   has been fraught with difficulty due to the large range of
   morphoanatomical and epidermal variation among species coupled with
   varying opinions on what diagnostic characters should be used to
   distinguish species. We shed light on this through using multivariate
   analysis (PCA, PCoA and cluster analysis), based on 20 variables
   (morphoanatomical and epidermal characteristics), to elucidate patterns
   of variation within this group and to test the validity of current
   species delimitations. The analysis of 89 OTU's recognized six clearly
   separated groups, corresponding to F. fiebrigii, F. hieronymi, F.
   lilloi, F. linigluma (a new species described here), F. samensis, and F.
   setifolia. The OTU's corresponding to F. fiebrigii were grouped as
   outliers with respect to the F. setifolia complex s. l. and were
   excluded from multivariate analysis. We redefine the F. setifolia
   complex s. s. to include F. linigluma, F. lilloi, and F. setifolia,
   which possess unique characters differentiating them from other members
   of the complex s. l. The status of type material was clarified, with F.
   tucumanica synonimised under F. lilloi, while F. erecta var. mutica, F.
   erecta var. aristulata, and F. dissitiflora var. loricata, F.
   weberbaueri, F. dissitiflora var. villipalea, and F. hieronymi subvar.
   expansa were placed as synonyms of F. fiebrigii, with the taxonomic
   concept of F. fiebrigii being redefined. We present an identification
   key, descriptions, illustrations, and revised geographic ranges for F.
   fiebrigii and the species of the F. setifolia complex s. l., including
   the new species, Festuca linigluma, from the central Andes.}},

Title = {{Rodent-avoidance, topography and forest structure shape territory
   selection of a forest bird}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Understanding the factors underlying habitat selection is
   important in ecological and evolutionary contexts, and crucial for
   developing targeted conservation action in threatened species. However,
   the key factors associated to habitat selection often remain poorly
   known. We evaluated hypotheses related to abiotic and biotic factors
   thought to affect territory selection of the wood warbler Phylloscopus
   sibilatrix, a passerine living in an unpredictable environment owing to
   irregular rodent outbreaks and showing long-term declines particularly
   in Western Europe.
   Results: Comparing breeding territories to unoccupied areas located
   close-by revealed that territory occupancy in north-western Switzerland
   was positively related to slope steepness (topographic hypothesis
   supported) as well as to numbers of tussocks and trees, respectively,
   while it showed a unimodal relationship to cover of herb layer (forest
   structure hypothesis supported). Furthermore, a strong negative
   correlation between breeding territory occupancy and rodent numbers was
   found, suggesting that wood warblers avoid areas with high rodent
   densities (rodent-avoidance hypothesis supported). Comparing breeding
   territories to abandoned territories showed that breeding territories
   were located on steeper slopes (topography hypothesis supported), at
   larger distance from the forest edge (anthropogenic disturbance
   hypothesis supported) and harboured more trees (forest structure
   hypothesis supported) than abandoned territories.
   Conclusions: Aside from structural and topographic features of the
   habitat, wood warblers are affected by rodent numbers when settling,
   making habitat selection unpredictable from year to year. Forestry
   practices promoting relatively high tree densities, few bushes and an
   intermediate low-growing ground vegetation cover would enhance habitat
   quality for this declining passerine. In contrast, forestry practices
   aiming at increasing light in forests (selective thinning,
   group-felling) or keeping forest stands permanently covered with shrubs,
   bushes and trees of various sizes (continuous cover forestry) do not
   benefit the wood warbler.}},

Abstract = {{Species distribution limits are hypothesized to be caused by small
   population size and limited genetic variation in ecologically relevant
   traits, but earlier studies have not evaluated genetic variation in
   multivariate phenotypes. We asked whether populations at the latitudinal
   edges of the distribution have altered quantitative genetic architecture
   of ecologically relevant traits compared with midlatitude populations.
   We calculated measures of evolutionary potential in nine Arabidopsis
   lyrata populations spanning the latitudinal range of the species in
   eastern and midwestern North America. Environments at the latitudinal
   extremes have reduced water availability, and therefore plants were
   assessed under wet and dry treatments. We estimated genetic
   variance-covariance (G-) matrices for 10 traits related to size,
   development, and water balance. Populations at southern and northern
   distribution edges had reduced levels of genetic variation across
   traits, but their G-matrices were more spherical; G-matrix orientation
   was unrelated to latitude. As a consequence, the predicted short-term
   response to selection was at least as strong in edge populations as in
   central populations. These results are consistent with genetic drift
   eroding variation and reducing the effectiveness of correlational
   selection at distribution margins. We conclude that genetic variation of
   isolated traits poorly predicts the capacity to evolve in response to
   multivariate selection and that the response to selection may frequently
   be greater than expected at species distribution margins because of
   genetic drift.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{86-95}},

Abstract = {{The increase of energy efficiency is a major goal of many countries
   throughout the world. For the successful achievement, consumers must
   choose energy-efficient household appliances. The European Union (EU)
   has introduced an energy label for energy-related durables to empower
   consumers to make energy-friendly choices. Due to the great progress in
   energy efficiency and the ban of inefficient products on the market,
   only products in the top efficiency classes are available for many
   categories, while products in lower classes are no longer manufactured.
   However, the energy-efficiency scale on the label still displays a range
   of seven classes (e.g., A(++)-E). This paper presents a systematic
   analysis of the influence of the presentation format of
   energy-efficiency information on consumers' assessments of products'
   energy friendliness. A series of experimental studies reveals that the
   display of a rating scale that includes only the energy-efficiency
   classes of products still available in the market (i.e., a shorter
   scale) enhances consumers' perceptions of the differences in energy
   friendliness between the classes. Consequently, the findings suggest
   that the format of the energy-efficiency scale significantly influences
   consumers' perceptions of the energy-efficiency gains of products in
   higher efficiency classes, positively affecting their motivation to
   choose the most energy-efficient products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Female Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) are mainly solitary
   and philopatric, leading to adult female relatives sharing adjacent and
   overlapping home ranges. Females tend to be intolerant of unrelated
   females, with whom they also may have overlapping home ranges. However,
   fights that lead to injuries are extremely rare and lethal aggression
   had never been observed. Here, we report the first case of lethal
   female-female aggression during over 26,000 h of focal data collected on
   adult females at Tuanan, Central Kalimantan: A young female, who had
   recently lost her infant, attacked an old resident female. The
   interaction's unique feature was that the attacking female was supported
   by an unflanged male, who had been in consort with her during the week
   preceding the attack and was responsible for the lethal injuries to the
   victim. The victim received protection from a flanged male who was
   probably attracted to the noise generated by the fight. We conclude that
   even in a species in which coercion is frequently observed in
   male-female interactions, female leverage over males can coax males into
   providing services, such as coalitionary support.}},

Title = {{Disparity in Onset Timing and Frequency of Flowering and Fruiting Events

Abstract = {{The timing and frequency of flowering and fruiting events are key
   tropical forest characteristics that have substantial influence on
   fauna. Although our understanding of geographic variation in
   habitat-wide timing and frequency of flowering and fruiting is
   advancing, corresponding information for individual tree species is
   limited. Thus, we compared climate and reproductive phenology of 16 tree
   species over 70 mo at two Bornean tropical peat-swamp forest sites. We
   found significant inter-site correlations in rainfall and temperature,
   and only small absolute temperature differences. In both sites, most
   species exhibited within-site synchrony in flowering and fruiting onset.
   Broad-scale flowering and fruiting onset frequency classifications
   showed high congruence between sites. Significant correlations in
   flowering and fruiting onset timing between sites were found for only 19
   and 17 percent of the species, respectively. This remained the case when
   applying 1- and 2-month lag periods for both sites, with neither site
   consistently lagging behind. Significant differences in the exact
   frequency of new flowering and fruiting events were detected for 44 and
   58 percent of species, respectively, and no significant relationships
   between the onset timing synchrony and exact frequency of new
   reproductive events were found for either flowers or fruit. We conclude
   that inter-site climatic and ecological similarities do not necessarily
   lead to high inter-site synchrony in either onset timing or exact
   frequency of tree reproductive events. Potential reasons for this are
   discussed, as are the implications for understanding tropical forest
   ecology and improving forest restoration project seed collections.
   Abstrak Waktu dan frekuensi peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah adalah
   karakteristik utama hutan tropis yang berpengaruh besar pada fauna.
   Pemahaman kita mengenai variasi geografis waktu berdasarkan habitat dan
   frekuensi peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah memang semakin maju namun
   informasi terkait mengenai masing-masing jenis pohon masih terbatas.
   Oleh sebab itu kami membandingkan iklim dan fenologi reproduksi dari 16
   jenis pohon selama 70 bulan di dua lokasi hutan rawa gambut tropis di
   Kalimantan. Kami menemukan korelasi signifikan antara curah hujan dan
   suhu antarlokasi, dan hanya ada perbedaan kecil dalam hal suhu mutlak.
   Di kedua situs, sebagian besar spesies menunjukkan keserempakan waktu
   permulaan peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah di dalam situs masing-masing.
   Klasifikasi frekuensi waktu permulaan berbunga dan berbuah dalam skala
   luas menunjukkan kesesuaian yang tinggi antarlokasi. Korelasi signifikan
   dalam hal waktu permulaan peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah antarlokasi
   hanya ditemukan berturut-turut dalam 19 dan 17 persen spesies. Hal ini
   tetap sama meskipun diterapkan 1 dan 2 bulan periode kelambatan pada
   kedua lokasi, dan tidak ada yang secara konsisten tertinggal. Perbedaan
   signifikan dalam hal frekuensi tepat dari peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah
   ditemukan secara berurut pada 44 dan 58 persen spesies, dan tidak ada
   hubungan yang signifikan antara keserempakan waktu permulaan dan
   frekuensi tepat dari peristiwa-peristiwa reproduksi baru yang ditemukan
   baik untuk bunga maupun buah. Kami menyimpulkan bahwa keserupaan ekologi
   dan iklim antarlokasi tidak selalu mengakibatkan keserempakan yang
   tinggi antarlokasi, baik dalam waktu permulaan maupun frekuensi tepat
   dari peristiwa-peristiwa reproduktif pohon. Berbagai alasan potensial
   yang menyebabkannya dibahas dalam tulisan ini, demikian pula beragam
   implikasinya, untuk memahami ekologi hutan tropis dan meningkatkan
   proyek restorasi hutan melalui koleksi benih.}},

Abstract = {{Many bacteria employ cis-2-unsaturated fatty acids, referred to as DSF
   (diffusible signal factor) family signals, to communicate with each
   other. Such systems have been shown to control biofilm formation,
   motility, production of hydrolytic enzymes and expression of virulence
   factors. We report the construction of novel biosensors on the basis of
   components of the Burkholderia-DSF (BDSF) dependent circuitry of
   BurkholderiacenocepaciaH111 and evaluated their utility for detecting
   the production of DSF family signal molecules. We show that a
   luxAB-based biosensor responds to nM levels of synthetic BDSF and is
   suitable to detect a wide range of cis-2 fatty acid molecules. Using
   this biosensor we show that the production of DSF family molecules is
   widespread among members of the B.cepacia complex and demonstrate for
   the first time that DSF-based molecules are also produced by
   plant-associated Burkholderia species.}},

Abstract = {{To date, technical and economic criteria have become the main benchmarks
   used in assessing the substitution potential of new materials.
   Sustainable product design uses multi-criteria decision methods to
   select the best material or process from a set of alternatives,
   requiring that the target product is already known. This paper follows a
   contrary approach by introducing the Multi-Perspective Application
   Selection, a method to support researchers and industrial practitioners
   alike in identifying and choosing the most promising and sustainable
   applications for new materials under development. This is achieved
   through combining and assessing technical, economic and environmental
   criteria covering the entire life cycle of an application. With this
   method, numerous possible applications can be screened during the early
   stages of material development when little information is available. The
   results help to narrow the selection of feasible products by excluding
   unpromising applications. The first step involves identifying and
   segmenting potential markets. In the second step, technical and economic
   aspects are assessed by employing user acceptance criteria. Finally,
   simplified life cycle assessment calculations are implemented in the
   third step to cover environmental considerations. Using an example of
   cellulose nanofiber reinforced composites, the authors illustrate the
   procedure whereby luxury consumer goods, specialty vehicles, industrial
   processing and furniture result as the most promising applications
   identified from this new method. The results give the researchers a more
   holistic understanding of their material and help to establish the
   requirements that the material must fulfill for the selected
   application. With that knowledge, the method can help enact development
   pathways in applied materials research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Genetic diversity of two tropical tree species of the Dipterocarpaceae

   plots with high species diversity}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY \& DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{459-469}},
Abstract = {{Background: The impact of logging and restoration on species diversity
   has been well studied in tropical forests. However, little is known
   about their effects on genetic diversity within species.
   Aims: We assess the degree of genetic diversity among dipterocarp
   seedlings used for enrichment planting of selectively logged forests in
   Sabah, Malaysia, and compare it with diversity in naturally regenerating
   seedlings. Methods: We sampled young leaf tissues from seedlings of
   Shorea leprosula and Parashorea malaanonan for DNA genotyping, using
   microsatellite markers.
   Results: The levels of genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity and
   rarefied allelic richness) of naturally regenerating seedlings were
   statistically indistinguishable among unlogged, once logged and
   repeatedly logged forest areas. Enrichment-planted seedlings of P.
   malaanonan exhibited similar levels of genetic diversity to naturally
   regenerating seedlings whereas those of S. leprosula had significantly
   lower genetic diversity than natural seedlings. Interestingly, reduction
   of genetic variation was consistently observed in single-species plots
   relative to mixed-species plots among enrichment-planted seedlings.
   Conclusions: There was no reduction of genetic variation in naturally
   regenerating dipterocarp seedlings in areas of selective logging.
   However, genetic variation of enrichment-planted seedlings was lower in
   single-species plots relative to mixed-species plots. This suggests that
   enrichment-planting strategies should adopt diverse mixtures that should
   promote levels of both species richness and genetic diversity within
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The study of the factors structuring genetic variation can help to infer
   the neutral and adaptive processes shaping the demographic and
   evolutionary trajectories of natural populations. Here, we analyse the
   role of isolation by distance (IBD), isolation by resistance (IBR,
   defined by landscape composition) and isolation by environment (IBE,
   estimated as habitat and elevation dissimilarity) in structuring genetic
   variation in 25 blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) populations. We typed
   1385 individuals at 26 microsatellite loci classified into two groups by
   considering whether they are located into genomic regions that are
   actively (TL; 12 loci) or not (NTL; 14 loci) transcribed to RNA.
   Population genetic differentiation was mostly detected using the panel
   of NTL. Landscape genetic analyses showed a pattern of IBD for all loci
   and the panel of NTL, but genetic differentiation estimated at TL was
   only explained by IBR models considering high resistance for natural
   vegetation and low resistance for agricultural lands. Finally, the
   absence for IBE suggests a lack of divergent selection pressures
   associated with differences in habitat and elevation. Overall, our study
   shows that markers located in different genomic regions can yield
   contrasting inferences on landscape-level patterns of realized gene flow
   in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Glacier calving can cause violent tsunami waves which, upon landfall,
   can cause severe destruction. Here we present data acquired during a
   calving event from Eqip Sermia, an ocean-terminating glacier in west
   Greenland. During an exceptionally well-documented event, the collapse
   of 9aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand x aEuro-10(5)aEuro-m(3) ice from a
   200aEuro-m high ice cliff caused a tsunami wave of 50aEuro-m height,
   traveling at a speed of 25-33aEuro-maEuro-s(-1). This wave was filmed
   from a tour boat at 800aEuro-m distance from the calving face, and
   simultaneously measured with a terrestrial radar interferometer and a
   tide gauge. Tsunami wave run-up height on the steep opposite shore at a
   distance of 4aEuro-km was 10-15aEuro-m, destroying infrastructure and
   eroding old vegetation. These observations indicate that such high
   tsunami waves are a recent phenomenon in the history of this glacier.
   Analysis of the data shows that only moderately bigger tsunami waves are
   to be expected in the future, even under rather extreme scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Variability in snow cover strongly influences mass budgets of glaciers,
   permafrost distribution, and seasonal discharge of rivers. In times of a
   changing climate, the spatio-temporal patterns of snow cover are of high
   interest. In this study, snow cover time series for the Aksu catchment
   in Central Tien Shan have been generated from optical remote sensing
   imagery. The analyses span a period between 1986 and 2013 and imbed
   Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) level 1b scenes, which
   were classified using a dichotomous decision scheme, as well as the
   preprocessed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) snow cover
   product. High congruence of the results could be achieved in spite of
   different sensors involved. However, a small bias appears especially at
   high elevations. The results from 2000 to 2013 reveal that snow
   accumulation begins in October and melting starts in March. Above an
   elevation of around 5200 m a.s.l., permanent snow cover can be expected,
   which is mirrored by a zonal mean of more than 85\% of snow for the
   whole period 1986-2013. Anomalies are very indicative and reveal a high
   interannual variability of snow cover in terms of quantity and spatial
   distribution. Change detection of snow cover probability (SCP) shows a
   slight decrease in lower altitudes up to 4000 m a.s.l. and an opposite
   trend above. However, the negative trends are not significant.
   Significant gradients have been found only at high elevations where the
   two data sources could not perfectly be harmonized. Comparisons with
   climatic variables show a similar temporal behavior of SCP and
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{A novel powdery mildew resistance gene and a new allele of Pm1 were
   identified and fine mapped. DNA markers suitable for marker-assisted
   selection have been identified.
   Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis is one of the most important
   foliar diseases of wheat and causes significant yield losses worldwide.
   Diploid A genome species are an important genetic resource for disease
   resistance genes. Two powdery mildew resistance genes, identified in
   Triticum boeoticum (A(b)A(b)) accession pau5088, PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2
   were mapped on chromosome 7AL. In the present study, shotgun sequence
   assembly data for chromosome 7AL were utilised for fine mapping of these
   Pm resistance genes. Forty SSR, 73 resistance gene analogue-based
   sequence-tagged sites (RGA-STS) and 36 single nucleotide polymorphism
   markers were designed for fine mapping of PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2.
   Twenty-one RGA-STS, 8 SSR and 13 SNP markers were mapped to 7AL. RGA-STS
   markers Ta7AL-4556232 and 7AL-4426363 were linked to the PmTb7A.1 and
   PmTb7A.2, at a genetic distance of 0.6 and 6.0 cM, respectively. The
   present investigation established that PmTb7A.1 is a new powdery mildew
   resistance gene that confers resistance to a broad range of Bgt
   isolates, whereas PmTb7A.2 most probably is a new allele of Pm1 based on
   chromosomal location and screening with Bgt isolates showing
   differential reaction on lines with different Pm1 alleles. The markers
   identified to be linked to the two Pm resistance genes are robust and
   can be used for marker-assisted introgression of these genes to
   hexaploid wheat.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   In grassland biodiversity experiments, positive biodiversity effects on
   primary productivity increase over time. Recent research has shown that
   differential selection in monoculture and mixed-species communities
   leads to the rapid emergence of monoculture and mixture types, adapted
   to their own biotic community. We used eight plant species selected for
   8 years in such a biodiversity experiment to test if monoculture and
   mixture types differed in metabolic profiles using infrared
   spectroscopy.
   Methods
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to assess
   metabolic fingerprints of leaf samples of 10 individuals of each species
   from either monocultures or mixtures. The FTIR spectra were analyzed
   using multivariate procedures to assess (i) whether individuals within
   species could be correctly assigned to monoculture or mixture history
   based on the spectra alone and (ii) which parts of the spectra drive the
   group assignment, i.e. which metabolic groups were subject to
   differential selection in monocultures vs. mixtures.
   Important Findings
   Plant individuals within each of the eight species could be classified
   as either from monoculture or mixture selection history based on their
   FTIR spectra. Different metabolic groups were differentially selected in
   the different species; some of them may be related to defense of
   pathogens accumulating more strongly in monocultures than in mixtures.
   The rapid selection of the monoculture and mixture types within the
   eight study species could have been due to a sorting-out process based
   on large initial genetic or epigenetic variation within the species.}},

Abstract = {{Moranopteris inaccessa, here described and illustrated, is a new species

   combination of elongate membranaceous laminae that are
   1-pinnate-pinnatifid. Found at 4,427 m, its distribution is over 500 m
   higher in elevation than any other species of Moranopteris. Phylogenetic
   analyses of atp beta, rbcL, and trnL-trnF molecular sequences, using
   maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analysis support M.
   inaccessa as sister to M. longisetosa. The two are similar in their
   elongate and highly divided leaves compared to other species of

Abstract = {{In butterflies, bees, flies and true bugs specific mouthparts are in
   close contact or even fused to enable piercing, sucking or sponging of
   particular food sources. The common phenomenon behind these mouthpart
   types is a complex composed of several consecutive mouthparts which
   structurally interact during food uptake. The single mouthparts are thus
   only functional in conjunction with other adjacent mouthparts, which is
   fundamentally different to biting chewing. It is, however, unclear when
   structural mouthpart interaction (SMI) evolved since this principle
   obviously occurred multiple times independently in several extant and
   extinct winged insect groups. Here, we report a new type of SMI in two
   of the earliest wingless hexapod lineages Diplura and Collembola. We
   found that the mandible and maxilla interact with each other via an
   articulatory stud at the dorsal side of the maxillary stipes, and they
   are furthermore supported by structures of the hypopharynx and head
   capsule. These interactions are crucial stabilizing elements during food
   uptake. The presence of SMI in these ancestrally wingless insects, and
   its absence in those crustacean groups probably ancestral to insects,
   indicates that SMI is a groundplan apomorphy of insects. Our results
   thus contradict the currently established view of insect mouthpart
   evolution that biting chewing mouthparts without any form of SMI are the
   ancestral configuration. Furthermore, SMIs occur in the earliest insects
   in a high anatomical variety. SMIs in stemgroup representatives of
   insects may have triggered efficient exploitation and fast adaptation to
   new terrestrial food sources much earlier than previously supposed.}},

Abstract = {{Uncovering genetic responses to selection in wild populations typically
   requires tracking individuals over generations and use of animal models.
   Our group monitored the body size of one Swiss Yellow Dung Fly
   (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae) field population over
   15 years, including intermittent common-garden rearing in the laboratory
   to assess body size with minimized environmental and maximized genetic
   variation. Contrary to expectations based on repeated heritability and
   phenotypic selection assessments over the years (reported elsewhere),
   field body sizes declined by >10\% and common-garden laboratory sizes by
   >5\% from 1993 to 2009. Our results confirm the temperature-size rule
   (smaller when warmer) and, albeit entirely correlational, could be
   mediated by climate change, as over this period mean temperature at the
   site increased by 0.5 degrees C, although alternative systematic
   environmental changes cannot be entirely excluded. Monitoring genetic
   responses to selection in wild invertebrate populations is thus
   possible, though indirect, and wild populations may evolve in directions
   not consistent with strongly positive directional selection favoring
   large body size.}},

Abstract = {{People's response to the decline of biodiversity and their support for
   conservation measures depends on their knowledge of biodiversity and
   their attitudes to local species. This study is one of the first to
   investigate public knowledge of, and attitudes to, frogs in South
   America. We chose two study regions, the semi-urban region of
   Pensilvania and the rural region of Florencia. In spring 2011, 565
   individuals completed a written questionnaire and a subsequent picture
   test. Overall, the public's attitudes to, and knowledge of frogs, were
   rather poor. Direct experiences and community elders were the major
   source of knowledge of frogs for participants in Florencia, whereas
   electronic media was the main source of knowledge in Pensilvania. Most
   participants felt that frogs are of high conservation value and
   important for medical and ecological purposes. The more strongly
   participants agreed that frogs are useful, of medicinal value, and
   beautiful, the more strongly they agreed that they should be conserved.
   Our results indicate that conservation education activities in schools
   and elsewhere are needed to improve people's knowledge of, and attitudes
   to, frogs. More positive attitudes toward local amphibian species might
   lead to an appreciation of their value and willingness to conserve them.}},

Abstract = {{When fractionation schemes for hypofractionation and stereotactic body
   radiotherapy are considered, a reliable cell survival model at high dose
   is needed for calculating doses of similar biological effectiveness. In
   this work, a simple model for cell survival which is valid also at high
   dose is developed from Poisson statistics. It is assumed that a cell is
   killed by an event that is defined by two double-strand breaks on the
   same or different chromosomes. Two different mechanisms can produce
   events. A one-track event is always represented by two simultaneous
   double-strand breaks. A two-track event results in one double-strand
   break. Therefore, at least two two-track events on the same or different
   chromosomes are necessary to produce an event. It is assumed that two
   double-strand breaks can be repaired with a certain repair probability.
   Both the one-track events and the two-track events are statistically
   independent. From the stochastic nature of cell killing which is
   described by the Poisson distribution, the cell survival probability was
   derived. The model was fitted to experimental data. It was shown that a
   solution based on Poisson statistics exists for cell survival. It
   exhibits exponential cell survival at high dose and a finite gradient of
   cell survival at vanishing dose, which is in agreement with experimental
   cell studies. The model fits the experimental data as well as the LQ
   model and is based on two free parameters. It was shown that cell
   survival can be described with a simple analytical formula on the basis
   of Poisson statistics. This solution represents in the limit of large
   dose the typical exponential behavior and predicts cell survival as well
   as the LQ model.}},

Abstract = {{Faecal nitrogen (FN) - the combination of metabolic nitrogen and
   residual food nitrogen - has been used as a proxy for diet quality in
   wild and domestic ruminants for over half a century. However, a common
   misconception in some of these studies is that FN is a direct proxy for
   dietary N, in spite of experimental evidence that links FN to general
   diet digestibility. Additionally, gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) can
   alter N metabolism and increase FN by various mechanisms. To clarify the
   role of dietary N, fibre and GIN as a factor in FN excretion, 10
   naturally parasitised sheep were fed two different isocaloric diets
   (LPF: low-protein, low-fibre; HPF: high-protein, high-fibre). One month
   after these diets began, a single anthelmintic treatment was applied to
   remove GIN, after which the sheep were kept on the same diet for an
   additional 2 weeks. Throughout the experiment, individual faecal samples
   were obtained to estimate both FN and GIN intensity (using faecal egg
   counts, FEC). In addition, two blood samples were taken before and after
   deworming to measure serum total protein concentrations (TP) as a proxy
   for protein absorption. In spite of the difference in dietary protein,
   FN was higher on an LPF diet, supporting the overall digestibility
   concept. The influence of GIN on FN was later revealed by the
   anthelmintic treatment, which led to a decrease of FEC and FN in both
   dietary groups. Serum total protein showed a slight but non-significant
   increase in both groups after the anthelmintic treatment. Our study
   supports not only the concept that FN is a proxy for diet digestibility,
   and not directly for dietary N, but also that gastrointestinal nematodes
   limit its use as a proxy for diet quality in ruminants, especially under
   high parasite loads (e.g., 1000 faecal eggs per gram of faeces). Such
   limitations should be considered before using FN for wildlife nutrition
   monitoring. Some recommendations are given to avoid misinterpretations.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the proposed criteria for measuring the quality and
   completeness of field spectroscopy metadata in a spectral archive.
   Definitions for metadata quality and completeness for field spectroscopy
   datasets are introduced. Unique methods for measuring quality and
   completeness of metadata to meet the requirements of field spectroscopy
   datasets are presented. Field spectroscopy metadata quality can be
   defined in terms of (but is not limited to) logical consistency,
   lineage, semantic and syntactic error rates, compliance with a quality
   standard, quality assurance by a recognized authority, and reputational
   authority of the data owners/data creators. Two spectral libraries are
   examined as case studies of operationalized metadata policies, and the
   degree to which they are aligned with the needs of field spectroscopy
   scientists. The case studies reveal that the metadata in publicly
   available spectral datasets are underperforming on the quality and
   completeness measures. This paper is part two in a series examining the
   issues central to a metadata standard for field spectroscopy datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination systems differ in pollen transfer efficiency, a variable
   that may influence the evolution of flower number. Here we apply a
   comparative approach to examine the link between pollen transfer
   efficiency and the evolution of inflorescence size in food and sexually
   deceptive orchids. We examined pollination performance in nine
   food-deceptive, and eight sexually deceptive orchids by recording pollen
   removal and deposition in the field. We calculated correlations between
   reproductive success and flower number (as a proxy for resources
   allocated during reproductive process), and directional selection
   differentials were estimated on flower number for four species. Results
   indicate that sexually deceptive species experience decreased pollen
   loss compared to food-deceptive species. Despite producing fewer
   flowers, sexually deceptive species attained levels of overall
   pollination success (through male and female function) similar to
   food-deceptive species. Furthermore, a positive correlation between
   flower number and pollination success was observed in food-deceptive
   species, but this correlation was not detected in sexually deceptive
   species. Directional selection differentials for flower number were
   significantly higher in food compared to sexually deceptive species. We
   suggest that pollination systems with more efficient pollen transfer and
   no correlation between pollination success and number of flowers
   produced, such as sexual deception, may allow the production of
   inflorescences with fewer flowers that permit the plant to allocate
   fewer resources to floral displays and, at the same time, limit
   transpiration. This strategy can be particularly important for
   ecological success in Mediterranean water-deprived habitats, and might
   explain the high frequency of sexually deceptive species in these
   specialised ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To determine if the phytotherapeutic agent, Bryophyllum pinnatum,
   could serve as an alternative drug for the overactive bladder syndrome,
   and to characterise the fraction responsible for the inhibition of
   detrusor contractility.
   Methods: Fractions were prepared from the MeOH extract of B. pinnatum
   and further analysed by HPLC-PDA-MS. Detrusor muscle strips were
   prepared from porcine bladders and the electrically induced muscle
   contractility measured by organ bath. The effect of B. pinnatum leaf
   press juice (2.5-10\%), a flavonoici fraction (0.1-1 mg/ml), and a
   bufadienolide fraction (0.1-40 mu g/ml) on cietrusor contractility was
   assessed and compared with controls (polar fraction (0.5-5 mg/ml) and
   oxybutynin (10(-8)-10(-6) M)).
   Results: The press juice, at a concentration of 10\% led to a reduction
   of detrusor contractility. Bladder strips treated with the flavonoid
   fraction showed a significant reduction of the contractility to 21.3 +/-
   5.2\% (1 mg/ml) while the bufadienolide fraction had no inhibitory
   effect in the investigated concentrations. The polar fraction showed a
   reduction of the contractility in a pH-dependent fashion. At 10(-6) M
   concentration oxybutynin reduced the detrusor contractility to 21.9 +/-
   4.7\%.
   Conclusions: The flavonoid fraction of Bryophyllum pinnatum reduces the
   porcine detrusor contractility in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
   Fractions from B. pinnatum may be a new pharmacological approach for the
   treatment of OAB. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier GmbH.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating vegetation phenology is crucial for a better understanding of
   the effects of climate change on the terrestrial ecosystem. The
   scientific community has used various vegetation index data sets from
   different sensors to quantify vegetation phenology from regional to
   global scales. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) related
   to photosynthetic activities is the most widely used index. Recently, a
   number of published articles have used the Medium Resolution Imaging
   Spectrometer (MERIS) terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) to measure
   vegetation phenology. MTCI can closely represent the red-edge position
   (REP). Unlike NDVI, MTCI is more sensitive to high values of chlorophyll
   content. However, the consistency of vegetation phenological metrics
   derived from MTCI and NDVI needs to be further explored. This study
   compared two phenological metrics, i.e. onset of greenness (OG) and end
   of senescence (ES), extracted from MERIS MTCI data and Advanced Very
   High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping
   Studies (GIMMS) first generation NDVI (NDVIg) data, which has the
   longest time records, at nine regions in China from 2003 to 2006. The
   results showed that the differences of OG and ES vary between different
   vegetation types, regions, and years, although both NDVI and MTCI time
   series capture the growth patterns well for most vegetation types.
   Compared to ES, the OG estimates are more consistent. NDVI yields in
   general later ES estimates than MTCI.}},

Abstract = {{Isotope labelling is a powerful tool to study elemental cycling within
   terrestrial ecosystems. Here we describe a new multi-isotope technique
   to label organic matter (OM).
   We exposed poplars (Populus deltoides x nigra) for 14 days to an
   atmosphere enriched in (CO2)-C-13 and depleted in (H2O)-H-2-O-18. After
   1 week, the water-soluble leaf OM ((delta C-13= 1346 162 parts per
   thousand) and the leaf water were strongly labelled (delta O-18= -63 +/-
   8, (delta H-2= 156 +/- 15 \%o). The leaf water isotopic composition was
   between the atmospheric and stem water, indicating a considerable
   back-diffusion of vapour into the leaves (58-69\%) in the opposite
   direction to the net transpiration flow. The atomic ratios of the labels
   recovered (O-18/C-13, H-2/C-13) were 2-4 times higher in leaves than in
   the stems and roots. This could be an indication of the synthesis of
   more condensed compounds in roots and stems (e.g. lignin vs. cellulose)
   or might be the result of 0 and H exchange and fractionation processes
   during phloem transport and biosynthesis.
   We demonstrate that the three major OM elements (C, 0, H) can be
   labelled and traced simultaneously within the plant. This approach could
   be of interdisciplinary interest in the fields of plant physiology,
   palaeoclimatic reconstruction or soil science.}},

   (insoluble, redox-inert) up to 24 h. Viability and inflammatory response
   were monitored with and without coincubation of a free-radical scavenger
   (trolox). In MAC elevated ROS levels, decreased metabolic activity and
   attenuated inflammatory mediator secretion were observed in response to
   Mn3O4. Addition of trolox partially resolved these changes. In AEC,
   decreased metabolic activity and an attenuated inflammatory mediator
   secretion were found in response to CeO2 exposure without increased
   production of ROS, thus not sensitive to trolox administration.
   Interestingly, highly redox-active soluble particles did not provoke an
   inflammatory response. The data reveal that target and effector cells of
   the lung react in different ways to particle exposure making a
   prediction of the response depending on redox activity and intracellular
   solubility difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and quantifying the temperature dependence of population
   parameters, such as intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity, is
   critical for predicting the ecological responses to environmental
   change. Many studies provide empirical estimates of such temperature
   dependencies, but a thorough investigation of the methods used to infer
   them has not been performed yet. We created artificial population time
   series using a stochastic logistic model parameterized with the
   Arrhenius equation, so that activation energy drives the temperature
   dependence of population parameters. We simulated different experimental
   designs and used different inference methods, varying the likelihood
   functions and other aspects of the parameter estimation methods.
   Finally, we applied the best performing inference methods to real data
   for the species Paramecium caudatum. The relative error of the estimates
   of activation energy varied between 5\% and 30\%. The fraction of
   habitat sampled played the most important role in determining the
   relative error; sampling at least 1\% of the habitat kept it below 50\%.
   We found that methods that simultaneously use all time series data
   (direct methods) and methods that estimate population parameters
   separately for each temperature (indirect methods) are complementary.
   Indirect methods provide a clearer insight into the shape of the
   functional form describing the temperature dependence of population
   parameters; direct methods enable a more accurate estimation of the
   parameters of such functional forms. Using both methods, we found that
   growth rate and carrying capacity of Paramecium caudatum scale with
   temperature according to different activation energies. Our study shows
   how careful choice of experimental design and inference methods can
   increase the accuracy of the inferred relationships between temperature
   and population parameters. The comparison of estimation methods provided
   here can increase the accuracy of model predictions, with important
   implications in understanding and predicting the effects of temperature
   on the dynamics of populations.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of genetic variation in traits under strong sexual
   selection is a longstanding problem in evolutionary biology. The genic
   capture model proposes that this problem can be explained by the
   evolution of condition dependence in exaggerated male traits. We tested
   the predictions that condition dependence should be more pronounced in
   male sexual traits and that genetic variance in expression of these
   traits should increase under stress as among-genotype variation in
   overall condition is exposed. Genetic variance in female and nonsexual
   traits should, by contrast, be similar across environments as a result
   of stabilizing selection on trait expression. The relationship between
   the degree of sexual dimorphism, condition dependence and additive
   genetic variance (V-a) was assessed for two morphological traits (body
   size and relative fore femur width) affecting male mating success in the
   black scavenger fly Sepsis punctum (Diptera: Sepsidae) and for
   development time (a nonsexual trait often correlated with body size). We
   compared trait expression between the sexes for two cross-continental
   populations that differ in degree of sexual dimorphism (Ottawa and
   Zurich). Condition dependence was indeed most pronounced in males of the
   strongly dimorphic Zurich population (males larger), and V-a was similar
   for males and females unless the trait was strongly sex specific and
   condition dependent. Contrary to prediction, however, V-a primarily
   increased under food limitation in both sexes, and genetic variance in
   fore femur width was low to nil, perhaps depleted by putatively strong
   sexual selection. Solely for body size of Zurich males, V-a increased
   more in males than females at limited food, in accordance with the
   predictions of the genic capture model. Overall therefore, quantitative
   genetic evidence in support of the model was inconsistent and weak at
   best.}},

Title = {{COMPLEX GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF PLOIDY LEVELS IN POLYLEPIS
   AUSTRALIS (ROSACEAE), AN ENDEMIC TREE LINE SPECIES IN ARGENTINA}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{175}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Premise of research. The geographical distribution of ploidy levels
   provides insights into evolutionary pathways. For the subtropical tree
   line species Polylepis australis (Rosaceae), we tested the hypotheses
   that (1a) incidence of polyploidy is higher in the northern parts than
   in the southern parts of the species range due to the presence of
   related species that might favor hybridization (allopolyploidy), (1b)
   incidence of polyploidy is higher in the southern part of the range
   because the species here presumably reaches the limit of its
   environmental tolerance (autopolyploidy), and (2) ploidy levels increase
   with elevation, as polyploids are believed to perform better in
   stressful environments.
   Methodology. We used flow cytometry to assess the ploidy levels of 361
   individuals from 27 populations across most of the distribution range of
   the species in two disjunct Argentinean high mountain regions.
   Pivotal results. The northern stands had lower ploidy levels (diploid)
   than the southern populations, in which we found mainly tetraploids
   intermixed with diploids, triploids, and a single hexaploid. We did not
   find any environmental correlates to the geographical distribution of
   ploidy levels.
   Conclusions. Polyploidy appears to have arisen in P. australis via
   autopolyploidy, either twice in different parts of the range or, more
   likely, once followed by long-distance dispersal. This is also supported
   by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data from a previous
   study that confirmed higher numbers of AFLP fragments and private bands
   in the southern populations. The checkerboard distribution of ploidy
   levels in the southern Sierras de Cordoba may represent a time capture
   of the spread of the polyploid condition. We propose that polyploidy
   represents a key factor to understanding the high morphological
   variation in P. australis and should be taken into account in ongoing
   reforestation activities.}},

Title = {{Regionalizing Indicator Values for Soil Reaction in the Bavarian Alps -

Journal = {{FOLIA GEOBOTANICA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{We present an approach to produce maps of Ellenberg values for soil
   reaction (R-value) in the Bavarian Alps. Eleven meaningful environmental
   predictors covering GIS-derived information on climatic, topographic and
   soil conditions were used to predict R-values. As dependent variables,
   Ellenberg indicator values for soil reaction were queried from plot
   records in the vegetation database WINALPecobase. We used an additive
   georegression model, which combines complex prediction models and the
   increased prediction accuracy of a boosting algorithm. In addition to
   environmental predictors we included spatial effects into the model to
   account for spatial autocorrelation. As we were particularly interested
   in the usefulness of averaged R-values for spatial prediction, we
   applied two different models: (1) a geo-additive regression model that
   estimates mean R-values and (2) a proportional odds model predicting the
   probability distribution over R-values 1 to 9. We found meaningful
   dependencies between the R-value and our predictors. Both models
   produced the same spatial pattern of predictions. Spatial effects had an
   impact only in the first model. The main drawback of mean R-values is
   the oversimplification of complex conditions of soil reaction, which is
   entailed by averaging and regression to mean values. Therefore,
   regionalized average indicator values provide only limited information
   on site-ecological characteristics. Model 1 failed to predict the range
   and shapes of original indicator spectra precisely. In contrast, the
   second model provided a more sophisticated picture of soil reaction. To
   make the multivariate output of model 2 comparable to that of model 1,
   we propose to plot the distribution in a three-dimensional color-space.
   In addition, comparison of both models based on a multiple linear
   regression model resulted in a R (2) of 0.93. The proportional odds
   model is a promising approach also for other indicator values and
   different regions as well as for other ordinal-scaled ecological
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Reintroducing locally extinct species is an increasingly used
   conservation tool. However, many reintroductions fail to establish
   self-sustaining populations. The quality of the individuals released may
   crucially affect reintroduction success, but it is largely unknown which
   quality traits are important and how they might be improved, especially
   in captive-reared animals. We aimed at increasing survival of
   captive-bred grey partridges (Perdix perdix) after release. We
   experimentally tested the effects of prenatal and postnatal
   unpredictable food supply on post-release survival of two captive
   strains (two or >30 generations in captivity). 691 Full-grown birds
   representing all eight strain x prenatal x postnatal treatment
   combinations were released in autumn in 28 social groups (coveys) and
   followed in the field for six months by radio tracking and visual
   observations. Data were analysed with multistate capture-recapture
   models including several random effects. Post-release survival was
   higher in birds having encountered postnatal unpredictable food supply
   and decreased drastically with later release dates. Also, coveys
   strongly affected an individual's survival prospects. Our results
   suggest that post-release survival of captive-bred grey partridges can
   be increased significantly through simple, inexpensive pre-release
   measures in captivity, i.e. exposing them to an unpredictable
   environment. Similar measures might be successful in other species and
   could ultimately enhance reintroduction success. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{At middle to high latitudes, many alpine valleys have been shaped by
   glaciers associated with periods of Pleistocene glaciation. Present
   glaciated valleys are characterised by broadened valley floors and
   U-shaped cross sections, continuously formed by glacial activity from
   initially V-shaped, fluvial cross sections. Sinks Canyon (Wind River
   Range, USA) is a glaciated valley characterised by a typical U-shaped
   cross section, containing till from several glacial advances over a
   range of at least 1 Ma. The morphostratigraphic records indicate a
   fourfold difference in ice surface elevation between the youngest and
   oldest glacial periods, which is not easily explained by the present-day
   valley topography. To assess possible evolution scenarios of Sinks
   Canyon, we modelled the palaeovalley topography using a geographic
   information system (GIS) filtering technique in combination with
   temporal reference points from relative and numerically dated glacial
   deposits. Ice thicknesses were calculated using the shallow ice
   approximation.
   In our model, the valley became shallower and the topography smoother
   with increasing years back in time. The results suggest that valley
   topography with ages between 640 and 1000 ka can clearly be
   distinguished from the present-day topography. Surfaces with ages of
   130-200 ka (attributable to MIS 6; Bull Lake glaciation) still could be
   discerned from present-day topography, but with relatively high
   uncertainties. The method did not work for topography less than similar
   to 100 ka or older than similar to 1 Ma. Erosion depths were calculated
   using the differences between present-day elevation and the modelled
   surfaces. Calculated erosion rates were within the range of reference
   values for glacial erosion (0.001 to 1 mm a(-1)). Glacial erosion
   appears to have removed 0.52 to 0.72 mm a(-1) of rock within a time
   frame of 1 Ma, assuming 200 ka of aggregated glacial flow. If the
   glacial occupation was longer or the impact of fluvial erosion was not
   negligible (as assumed), then the calculated rate is lower. If the model
   assumes a less extended rime of glacial flow (<100 ka), the rate exceeds
   1 mm a(-1). The method used for surface reconstruction and erosion rates
   calculation is highly dependent on (i) the reliability of the temporal
   anchor points and (ii) the assumption of physical glacier conditions
   (basal shear stress). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Sinai primrose (Primula boveana) is one of the most endangered plant
   species worldwide, with less than 200 wild individuals surviving in the
   Sinai mountains of Egypt. There has been a decline in both the number
   and size of its populations in recent times, possibly caused by threats
   that include habitat aridification and the impact of human activities.
   Studying the standing genetic variation and extent of inbreeding of P.
   boveana is necessary for the design of appropriate conservation
   strategies for this species. In the present work, we used a set of
   seven, recently developed, polymorphic microsatellite markers to
   characterize the genetic variation and levels of inbreeding of the
   extant populations of P. boveana. We found low levels of genetic
   variation (H (T) = 0.470), high differentiation between populations (F
   (ST) = 0.737, R (ST) = 0.935), and very elevated levels of inbreeding (F
   = 0.862) due to recurrent selfing. These results may be the reflection
   of low levels of genetic variation and high levels of inbreeding over a
   long evolutionary period, suggesting that the current genetic pool of
   the species may enable P. boveana to persist in a habitat where water
   availability and pollinator services are restricted. Nevertheless, in
   sight of its rapidly dwindling abundance, it seems prudent to adopt
   swift measures, including habitat restoration and ex-situ conservation,
   to prevent the impending extinction of this emblematic species.}},

Abstract = {{Following studies that showed negative effects of species loss on
   ecosystem functioning, newer studies have started to investigate if
   similar consequences could result from reductions of genetic diversity
   within species. We tested the influence of genotypic richness and
   dissimilarity (plots containing one, three, six or 12 genotypes) in
   stands of the invasive plant Solidago canadensis in China on the
   decomposition of its leaf litter and associated soil animals over five
   monthly time intervals. We found that the logarithm of genotypic
   richness was positively linearly related to mass loss of C, N and P from
   the litter and to richness and abundance of soil animals on the litter
   samples. The mixing proportion of litter from two sites, but not
   genotypic dissimilarity of mixtures, had additional effects on measured
   variables. The litter diversity effects on soil animals were
   particularly strong under the most stressful conditions of hot weather
   in July: at this time richness and abundance of soil animals were higher
   in 12-genotype litter mixtures than even in the highest corresponding
   one-genotype litter. The litter diversity effects on decomposition were
   in part mediated by soil animals: the abundance of Acarina, when used as
   covariate in the analysis, fully explained the litter diversity effects
   on mass loss of N and P. Overall, our study shows that high genotypic
   richness of S. canadensis leaf litter positively affects richness and
   abundance of soil animals, which in turn accelerate litter decomposition
   and P release from litter.}},

Abstract = {{In many applications, the environmental context for and drivers of
   movement patterns are just as important as the patterns themselves. This
   article adapts standard data mining techniques, combined with a
   foundational ontology of causation, with the objective of helping domain
   experts identify candidate causal relationships between movement
   patterns and their environmental context. In addition to data about
   movement and its dynamic environmental context, our approach requires as
   input definitions of the states and events of interest. The technique
   outputs causal and causal-like relationships of potential interest,
   along with associated measures of support and confidence. As a
   validation of our approach, the analysis is applied to real data about
   fish movement in the Murray River in Australia. The results demonstrate
   that the technique is capable of identifying statistically significant
   patterns of movement indicative of causal and causal-like relationships.}},

Title = {{Denudation rates of small transient catchments controlled by former
   glaciation: The Hornli nunatak in the northeastern Swiss Alpine Foreland}},
Journal = {{QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Extensive glaciers repeatedly occupied the northern Alpine Foreland
   during the Pleistocene and left a strongly glacially overprinted low
   slope landscape. Only few islands appeared as nunataks standing above
   the surface of the large piedmont glacier lobes. These nunatak areas
   kept their original shape, manifested in steep catchments with mean
   slopes up to 33 degrees. Even though not glaciated, these catchments
   where significantly affected by base-level changes occurring as a
   consequence of phases of glacier advances and retreats. Both domains,
   the glacially eroded and non-eroded, are therefore prone to different
   mechanisms and time-scales of fluvial and colluvial re-adjustment.
   In this study we investigate these effects by exploring the spatial
   distribution and magnitude of denudation in the Hornli region of the
   eastern Swiss Alpine Foreland in the present Interglacial. The area
   represents both domains in a relatively small area with largely uniform
   tectonic, lithologic and climatic conditions. The differences in
   Holocene landscape evolution are investigated using topographic analyses
   and catchment-averaged denudation rates derived from Be-10
   concentrations in fluvial quartz sand. We find that in formerly
   non-glaciated, fluvially dominated catchments close hillslope-channel
   coupling prevails and that these catchments yield high average
   denudation rates of 350 mm/ka. Glacially over-printed catchments yielded
   catchment-wide denudation rates an order of magnitude lower. These low
   denudation rates are hypothesized to be the consequence of both (i) a
   dominance of slow hillslope processes and (ii) admixture of high
   concentration, pre-LGM glacial sediment. This suggests that a) a careful
   field investigation must accompany the denudation rate studies and b)
   that the concept of area-weighted cosmogenic nuclide denudation rates
   must be considered in light of the predominant catchment processes. (C)

Abstract = {{A 2012 microphytobenthos survey from coral reef environment at Napuka
   Atoll (Tuamotu Archipelago, South Pacific) focussed on diatom
   assemblages. Atolls are tropical carbonate, productive ecosystems, with
   a fast turnover, from which benthic diatom floras are poorly known. When
   compared to younger volcanic islands from the same area, Napuka shows a
   poor colonisation by benthic diatoms. Although normally rare,
   Achnanthales occur in the assemblages from Napuka. In the tidal zone,
   marine debris of sponge origin were colonized by several taxa, among
   others a small-celled Cocconeis here described as C. napukensis sp. nov.
   The new taxon has some likeness to Cocconeis subtilissima MEISTER and to
   C. vairaensis RICARD. Original drawings and type material are examined
   when available. A lectotypification and an emended description of
   Cocconeis subtilissima are proposed, along with the description of
   Cocconeis suzukii sp. nov. and Cocconeis meisteri sp. nov. from Meister
   type material. The morphological features of C. napukensis are
   investigated with scanning electron miscroscope (SEM) and light

Abstract = {{Environmental factors and physiological controls on photosynthesis
   influence the carbon isotopic signature of ecosystem respiration. Many
   ecosystem studies have used stable carbon isotopes to investigate
   environmental controls on plant carbon transfer from above- to
   belowground. However, a clear understanding of the internal mechanisms
   underlying time-lagged responses of carbon isotopic signatures in
   ecosystem respiration to environmental changes is still lacking. This
   study addressed plant physiological controls on the transfer time of
   recently assimilated carbon from assimilation to respiration. We
   produced a set of six wheat plants with varying physiological
   characteristics, by growing them under a wide range of nitrogen supply
   and soil water content levels under standardised conditions. The plants
   were pulse-labelled with C-13-CO2, and the isotopic signature of CO2
   respired in the dark by plants and soil was monitored continuously over
   two days. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) was strongly related to the rate
   of transfer of recently assimilated carbon belowground. The higher g(s),
   the faster newly assimilated carbon was allocated belowground and the
   faster it was respired in the soil. Our results suggest that carbon sink
   strength of plant tissues may be a major driver of transfer velocity of
   recently assimilated carbon to plant respiratory tissues and soil
   respiration.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS) to fresh apple may tolerate
   low allergenic apple cultivars. We aimed to investigate if the low
   allergenic properties of Elise and Santana, as previously identified in
   a Dutch population, could be generalised within North West Europe within
   the birch pollen region with regard to both the prevalence and degree of
   sensitization. Prick-to-prick tests (PTP) were performed in eighty-five
   adult patients with OAS to fresh apple in Great Britain, Switzerland and
   Northern Italy, before the birch pollen season, using the putatively low
   allergenic apple cultivars Elise, Santana, Granny Smith, Modi and
   Mcintosh, as well as the putatively high allergenic apple cultivars
   Golden Delicious and Kanzi. No significant differences in percentages of
   negative responses of PTPs were found between the three countries.
   Negative responses did not differ from negative responses to the
   different apple cultivars we previously found in 2006/2007 in the
   Netherlands. The size of the PTPs of all apple cultivars tested were
   correlated to the size of the skin prick tests with birch pollen. These
   results add to the indications for the low allergenic properties of the
   low allergenic apple cultivars Santana and Elise, as the number of
   negative responses were reproducible in three countries within the birch
   pollen region and were similar to previous results in the Netherlands.
   These results justify oral challenge studies with Elise and Santana
   within the birch pollen region, to establish the low allergenic
   properties for the benefit for apple allergic consumers for definite
   conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the role leaf phenolics in defending against ultraviolet B (UVB)
   under previously controlled conditions, we hypothesize that ultraviolet
   radiation (UVR) could be a primary factor driving the variation in leaf
   phenolics in plants over a large geographic scale. We measured leaf
   total phenolics, ultraviolet-absorbing compounds (UVAC), and
   corresponding leaf N, P, and specific leaf area (SLA) in 151 common
   species. These species were from 84 sites across the Tibetan Plateau and
   Inner Mongolian grasslands of China with contrasting UVR (354 vs.
   161mW/cm(2) on average). Overall, leaf phenolics and UVAC were all
   significantly higher on the Tibetan Plateau than in the Inner Mongolian
   grasslands, independent of phylogenetic relationships between species.
   Regression analyses showed that the variation in leaf phenolics was
   strongly affected by climatic factors, particularly UVR, and soil
   attributes across all sites. Structural equation modeling (SEM)
   identified the primary role of UVR in determining leaf phenolic
   concentrations, after accounting for colinearities with altitude,
   climatic, and edaphic factors. In addition, phenolics correlated
   positively with UVAC and SLA, and negatively with leaf N and N: P. These
   relationships were steeper in the lower-elevation Inner Mongolian than
   on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands. Our data support that the variation
   in leaf phenolics is controlled mainly by UV radiation, implying high
   leaf phenolics facilitates the adaptation of plants to strong
   irradiation via its UV-screening and/or antioxidation functions,
   particularly on the Tibetan Plateau. Importantly, our results also
   suggest that leaf phenolics may influence on vegetation attributes and
   indirectly affect ecosystem processes by covarying with leaf functional
   traits.}},

   there is only one morphospecies present at the type locality on Fiji,
   three species can be characterized along an elevational transect on New
   Guinea. Alsophila hornei is also present at low elevations throughout
   New Guinea. Alsophila phlebodes is newly described and so far only found
   at high elevations on the Vogelkop Peninsula of New Guinea. Among its
   sympatric congeners, it stands out by having relatively pale brown
   petiole scales and well-developed, highly dissected remote basal pinnae
   on the petioles that form a wig-like structure around the trunk apex.
   Alsophila olivacea is reinstated and separated from A. hornei and A.
   phlebodes mainly by lacking adventitious pinnae and having an
   intermediate elevational distribution in the mountains of New Guinea. A
   key to the Australasian species of the Gymnophaera clade is provided in

   never been fully characterized. In the present study, authors did a
   revision of the distribution range using herbaria material, database

   extending from Cottian to Maritime and Ligurian Alps, with few outlier
   occurrences in the northern Apennines. The localities previously
   reported from northern Piedmont (Val d'Ossola) were not confirmed.
   Maximum entropy model (Maxent) was used to simulate the potential
   distribution of P. marginata under current climate conditions. According
   to the distribution modelling performed, the species prefers rocky
   calcareous habitats mainly at high elevations, with abundant
   precipitation, but low moisture retention at soil level and marked
   temperature range between winter and summer seasons. The potential
   distribution area drawn by Maxent seemed to describe P. marginata at its
   maximum extension, and any future climate changes might cause
   limitations for the survival of the species.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray imaging is a nondestructive and preferred method in paleopathology
   to reconstruct the history of ancient diseases. Sophisticated imaging
   technologies such as computed tomography (CT) have become common for the
   investigation of skeletal disorders in human remains. Researchers have
   investigated the impact of ionizing radiation on living cells, but never
   on ancient cells in dry tissue. The effects of CT exposure on ancient
   cells have not been examined in the past and may be important for
   subsequent genetic analysis. To remedy this shortcoming, we developed
   different Monte Carlo models to simulate X-ray irradiation on ancient
   cells. Effects of mummification were considered by using two sizes of
   cells and three different phantom tissues, which enclosed the
   investigated cell cluster. This cluster was positioned at the isocenter
   of a CT scanner model, where the cell hit probabilities P(0,1,aEuro
   broken vertical bar, n) were calculated according to the Poisson
   distribution. To study the impact of the dominant physics process, CT
   scans for X-ray spectra of 80 and 120 kVp were simulated. Comparison
   between normal and dry tissue phantoms revealed that the probability of
   unaffected cells increased by 21 \% following cell shrinkage for 80 kVp,

   deeper-lying ancient cells from radiation damage at 80 kVp X-rays.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of non-volatile organic compounds-environmental toxins
   (methyltriclosane and phenanthrene), bovine serum albumin, as well as
   bioparticles (Legionella pneumophila, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus
   anthracis)-in a commercially available plasma air purifier based on a
   cold plasma was studied in detail, focusing on its efficiency and on the
   resulting degradation products. This system is capable of handling air
   flow velocities of up to 3.0 m s(-1) (3200 L min(-1)), much higher than
   other plasma-based reactors described in the literature, which generally
   are limited to air flow rates below 10 L min(-1). Mass balance studies
   consistently indicated a reduction in concentration of the
   compounds/particles after passage through the plasma air purifier, 31\%
   for phenanthrene, 17\% for methyltriclosane, and 80\% for bovine serum
   albumin. L. pneumophila did not survive passage through the plasma air
   purifier, and cell counts of aerosolized spores of B. subtilis and B.
   anthracis were reduced by 26- and 15-fold, depending on whether it was
   run at 10 Hz or 50 Hz, respectively. However rather than chemical
   degradation, deposition on the inner surfaces of the plasma air purifier
   occured. Our interpretation is that putative ``degradation{''}
   efficiencies were largely due to electrostatic precipitation rather than
   to decomposition into smaller molecules. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Stage structures of populations can have a profound influence on their
   dynamics. However, not much is known about the transient dynamics that
   follow a disturbance in such systems. Here we combined chemostat
   experiments with dynamical modeling to study the response of the
   phytoplankton species Chlorella vulgaris to press perturbations. From an
   initially stable steady state, we altered either the concentration or
   dilution rate of a growth-limiting resource. This disturbance induced a
   complex transient response-characterized by the possible onset of
   oscillations-before population numbers relaxed to a new steady state.
   Thus, cell numbers could initially change in the opposite direction of
   the long-term change. We present quantitative indexes to characterize
   the transients and to show that the dynamic response is dependent on the
   degree of synchronization among life stages, which itself depends on the
   state of the population before perturbation. That is, we show how
   identical future steady states can be approached via different
   transients depending on the initial population structure. Our
   experimental results are supported by a size-structured model that
   accounts for interplay between cell-cycle and population-level processes
   and that includes resource-dependent variability in cell size. Our
   results should be relevant to other populations with a stage structure
   including organisms of higher order.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal variation of tropical insect communities has rarely
   been studied, although such variation influences estimates of global
   species richness. Therefore, we compared spatial and temporal variation
   of herbivorous insect communities on Neoboutonia macrocalyx trees among
   seven sites over 1 y in a primary tropical rain forest in Kibale
   National Park, Uganda. The distance between the study sites varied from
   4.8 to 31.2 km and altitudinal differences ranged from 20 to 242 m.
   Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) revealed
   significant spatial changes in community composition of the herbivorous
   insects and study sites differed also in insect abundance (6.9-26.2
   individuals m(-2) of leaf area). This is likely to be caused by
   differences in vegetation, altitude and microclimate among the study
   sites. The similarity of insect species composition was negatively
   correlated with geographic and altitudinal distances among sites and
   positively correlated with the similarity of tree community composition.
   Species richness varied significantly between sampling dates, ranging
   from 33 to 41 species. Also community compositions changed between
   sampling dates, which likely follows from marked seasonal changes in
   climate and the phenology of other host plants used by the generalist
   insect species also living on Neoboutonia macrocalyx. In general our
   study supports the idea of high variability of herbivorous insect
   communities in primary rain forests even at a small spatial scale. This
   should be considered when estimations of insect biodiversity are made.}},

Title = {{COMPARATIVE STUDY OF INFLORESCENCE DEVELOPMENT IN OLEACEAE}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{647-663}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Investigations of inflorescence architecture offer
   insight into the evolution of an astounding array of reproductive shoot
   systems in the angiosperms, as well as the potential to genetically
   manipulate these branching patterns to improve crop yield and enhance
   the aesthetics of horticultural species. The diversity of inflorescences
   in the economically important family Oleaceae was studied from a
   comparative developmental point of view for the first time, based on
   species of seven genera (Chionanthus, Fontanesia, Fraxinus, Jasminum,
   Ligustrum, Olea, Syringa).
   Methods: Series of developmental stages of chemically fixed
   inflorescences were studied with epi-illumination light microscopy.
   Key results: All taxa studied have inflorescences with terminal flowers.
   The inflorescences are mostly panicles, but in some cases thyrsoids or
   compound botryoids. Phyllotaxis of the flower-subtending bracts is
   mostly decussate, rarely tricussate (Fraxinus) or spiral (Jasminum).
   Accessory flowers or accessory inflorescences, almost unknown in
   Oleaceae as yet, were found in two genera. In Syringa, common
   bract-flower primordia are formed by a delay in early bract development
   compared to flower development. Such a delay is also expressed by the
   loss of bracts in the distal part of inflorescence branches in Syringa
   and Chionanthus.
   Conclusions: Significant variation in branching pattern and phyllotaxy
   was observed among the studied species of Oleaceae. The suppression of
   bracts and formation of accessory flowers were found as special features
   of inflorescence ontogeny. The occurrence of accessory flowers and
   accessory partial inflorescences is interesting from the point of view
   of dense and flower-rich inflorescences in ornamental species.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{461-480}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Freshwater ecosystems rely on allochthonous resources. Integration of
   these subsidies depends on diversity of both terrestrial resources and
   aquatic shredder and decomposer communities, but the diversity effects
   on leaf litter breakdown and decomposition are less clear in aquatic
   than terrestrial ecosystems. We need a better understanding of this
   relationship because aquatic communities are rapidly changing with
   species invasions and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we experimentally
   disentangled the effects of leaf and shredder richness on leaf litter
   breakdown by macroinvertebrates in mesocosm experiments using three
   species of amphipods, a dominant guild of crustaceans in European
   freshwater ecosystems. Increased leaf richness led to
   lower-than-predicted leaf consumption by native shredders, with mixed
   evidence of resource-switching or prioritization of preferred food items
   within a leaf mix. Higher shredder species richness never promoted leaf
   consumption rates compared to predictions from relevant single-species
   experiments, and instead sometimes substantially decreased leaf
   consumption. We then conducted a meta-analysis of leaf litter
   consumption rates by seven widely distributed amphipod species (the
   three used in the experiments and four additional species). As expected
   based on our own experiments, nonnative amphipod species generally had
   lower biomass-adjusted leaf litter consumption rates, although their
   larger body size led to higher per-individual leaf consumption rates.
   Contamination of the water by metals, pesticides, and other chemicals
   additionally significantly decreased leaf litter consumption by multiple
   native and nonnative species compared to unpolluted systems. While the
   meta-analysis suggested that litter consumption, and thus breakdown,
   would decline if native shredders are replaced by nonnative
   heterospecifics, complete species replacement is not the only outcome
   following immigration in a meta-community context. Our experiments
   suggest that breakdown rates could remain reasonably high where native
   species coexist with nonnative arrivals. Experiments that neglect the
   ecological realism of species coexistence will necessarily
   mischaracterize effects on ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Various plant species establish intimate symbioses with bacteria within
   their aerial organs. The bacteria are contained within nodules or glands
   often present in distinctive patterns on the leaves, and have been used
   as taxonomic marker since the early 20th century. These structures are
   present in very diverse taxa, including dicots (Rubiaceae and
   Primulaceae) and monocots (Dioscorea). The symbionts colonize the plants
   throughout their life cycles and contribute bioactive secondary
   metabolites to the association. In this review, we present recent
   progress in the understanding of these plant-bacteria symbioses,
   including the modes of transmission, distribution and roles of the
   symbionts.}},

Abstract = {{The Andean Lupinus radiation presents one of the highest rates of net
   species diversification in plants and includes species with a wide
   variety of growth forms, but the detailed geographical and adaptive
   trajectories of -diversification in the Andes remain unresolved. One of
   the most distinctive of these growth forms is the
   fistulose-inflorescence rosette, FIR, typical of tropical high-elevation
   habitats. To gain insights into the evolutionary origins of this growth
   form and the biogeography of Andean Lupinus, genome-scale nextRADseq
   data were generated for 124 individuals from the northern and central
   Andes. The RADseq data provide unprecedented phylogenetic resolution
   among the recently diverged Andean Lupinus spp. and suggest multiple
   independent evolutionary origins of the rosette growth form and marked
   geographical structure across the northern Andes at different scales.
   This suggests that both adaptive (ecological) and geographically driven
   non-adaptive diversification have contributed to rapid recent species
   diversification. Among the north-Andean FIR Lupinus spp., our results
   strongly support recognition of L. -alopecuroides (Central Cordillera
   and northern Ecuador), L. triananus (southern portion of the Eastern
   Cordillera) and a putative new species from the ` Pisba-Cocuy' and `
   Ocete' paramos (northern portion of the Eastern Cordillera).}},

Abstract = {{Detecting interaction between species is notoriously difficult, and
   disentangling species associations in host-related gut communities is
   especially challenging. Nevertheless, due to contemporary methods,
   including metabarcoding and 16S sequencing, collecting observational
   data on community composition has become easier and much more common.
   We studied the previously collected datasets of intestinal bacterial
   microbiota and parasite compositions within longitudinally followed
   mouse lemurs by analysing the potential interactions with diversity
   metrics and novel joint species distribution modelling.
   Both methods showed statistical association between certain parasite
   species and bacterial microbiota composition. Unicellular Eimeria sp.
   had an effect on diversity of gut microbiota. The cestode Hymenolepis
   diminuta had negative associations with several bacterial orders,
   whereas closely related species Hymenolepis nana had positive
   associations with several bacterial orders.
   Our results reveal potential interactions between some, but not all,
   intestinal parasites and gut bacterial microbiota. Host variables
   contributed over half of the total variation explained with the model,
   and sex was the most important single host variable; especially with
   microbiota, there were sex-related differences in the community
   composition.
   This study shows how joint species distribution modelling can
   incorporate both within-host dynamics of several taxa and host
   characteristics to model potential interactions in intestinal community.
   These results provide new hypothesis for interactions between and among
   parasites and bacterial microbiota to be tested further with
   experimental studies.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{45}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Trade-offs allow individuals to optimize their fitness by tailoring
   the investment into different traits to variable environmental
   conditions, such as along geographical gradients. Trade-offs thus can
   help in adjusting to changing thermal and insolation profiles,
   especially in small ectotherms, whose body temperature typically follows
   environmental temperatures closely. Two traits usually involved in
   latitudinal adaptation are body size and melanism. Since both traits are
   costly, individuals need to optimize investment into each trait. Here,
   we studied how environmental factors influence this trade-off in the
   short and long-term.
   Location: Europe.
   MethodsWe raised flies from 15 latitudinal populations at three constant
   temperatures in a laboratory common garden to differentiate plastic and
   evolutionary responses to temperature. We further analysed how the
   different insolation components of the populations' habitats influenced
   the evolution of the trade-off.
   Results: Male Sepsis thoracica (Diptera: Sepsidae) feature a sigmoid
   relationship between melanism and body size, defining two strikingly
   different male morphs: obsidian (small and black) and amber (large and
   orange). This relationship was altered by the developmental temperature,
   documenting its plasticity. The relationship further evolved across
   populations in response to the environmental characteristics of their
   habitat, notably temperature, insolation and UV radiation, suggesting
   that plasticity also has an underlying genetic basis. Nevertheless,
   melanism, but not body size, merely slightly increased with latitude.
   Main conclusions: As the plastic and evolutionary responses of the
   relationship to temperature differed, plasticity does not necessarily
   follow the direction of evolution of this trade-off, but rather adds to
   it. Our study evinces the role of several environmental factors in
   shaping the evolution of a plastic melanismbody size relationship
   defining a rare male polymorphism in temperate sepsid flies.}},

Abstract = {{Leu-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are chimeric proteins containing an
   N-terminal Leu-rich repeat (LRR) and a C-terminal extensin domain. LRXs
   are involved in cell wall formation in vegetative tissues and required
   for plant growth. However, the nature of their role in these cellular
   processes remains to be elucidated. Here, we used a combination of
   molecular techniques, light microscopy, and transmission electron
   microscopy to characterize mutants of pollen-expressed LRXs in
   Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Mutations in multiple
   pollen-expressed lrx genes cause severe defects in pollen germination
   and pollen tube growth, resulting in a reduced seed set. Physiological
   experiments demonstrate that manipulating Ca2+ availability partially
   suppresses the pollen tube growth defects, suggesting that LRX proteins
   influence Ca2+-related processes. Furthermore, we show that LRX protein
   localizes to the cell wall, and its LRR-domain (which likely mediates
   protein-protein interactions) is associated with the plasma membrane.
   Mechanical analyses by cellular force microscopy and finite element
   method-based modeling revealed significant changes in the material
   properties of the cell wall and the fine-tuning of cellular biophysical
   parameters in the mutants compared to the wild type. The results
   indicate that LRX proteins might play a role in cell wall-plasma
   membrane communication, influencing cell wall formation and cellular
   mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{1. The explicit and implicit aims of creating ecological focus areas
   (EFAs) and implementing greening measures in European agro-ecosystems
   include the promotion of regulatory ecosystem services (ES) to sustain
   crop production in conventional cropping systems. However, the extent to
   which these goals are achieved with current policy measures remains
   poorly explored.
   2. We measured insect-mediated pollination and natural pest control
   service provisioning in 18 winter oilseed rape fields as a function of
   the independent and interactive effects of local EFA establishment-sown
   wildflower strips and hedgerows-and landscape-scale greening measures
   within a 1 km radius around focal fields and quantified their
   contribution to crop yield.
   3. Insect pollination potential and pest predation increased on average
   by 10\% and 13\%, respectively, when landscape-scale greening measures
   share was increased from 6\% to 26\%. For pollination, the increase was
   stronger in fields adjoining an EFA (14\%) than in fields without
   adjacent EFA (7\%).
   4. Agricultural management practices were the main drivers of crop
   yield. Neither insect pollination potential or natural pest control
   (pest predation and parasitism) nor adjacent EFAs and landscape-scale
   greening significantly affected crop yield in addition to agricultural
   management.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Local establishment of perennial,
   species-rich wildflower strips and hedgerows, combined with
   landscape-scale greening measures in agricultural landscapes, can
   promote multiple ecosystem services (ES) in conventional production
   systems. Benefits may be maximized when local and landscape measures are
   combined. However, enhanced pollination and natural pest regulation seem
   to contribute relatively little to final crop yield compared to local
   agricultural management practices in the high-input conventional
   production system studied. Further research is needed to better
   understand how to improve the effectiveness of ecological focus areas
   and other greening measures in promoting regulatory ES. Potential
   improvements include minimising trade-offs while promoting synergies
   between ES provision, food production and biodiversity conservation.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{619-629}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{According to the Red Queen hypothesis, clonal diversity in asexual
   populations could be maintained by negative frequency-dependant
   selection by coevolving parasites. If common clones are selected against
   and rare clones gain a concomitant advantage, we expect that clonal
   turnover should be faster during parasite epidemics than between them.
   We tested this hypothesis exploring field data of the Daphnia-Caullerya
   host-parasite system. The clonal make-up and turnover of the Daphnia
   host population was tracked with high temporal resolution from 1998
   until 2013, using first allozyme and later microsatellite markers.
   Significant differences in the clonal composition between random and
   infected subsamples of Daphnia populations were detected on six of seven
   tested occasions, confirming genetic specificity of the host-parasite
   interaction in this system. We used time series analysis to compare the
   rates of host clonal turnover to the incidence of parasitism, and found
   that Caullerya prevalence was significantly associated with
   microsatellite-based clonal turnover. As alternate hypotheses, we
   further tested whether turnover was related to a variety of biotic,
   abiotic, and host demographic parameters. Other significant correlates
   of turnover were cyanobacterial biomass and (weakly) temperature.
   Overall, parasitism seems to be a strong driver of host clonal turnover,
   in support of the Red Queen hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal autocorrelation in demographic processes is an important aspect

   population models from 454 plant and animal populations to simulate
   stochastic population growth rates (log lambda(s)) under different
   temporal autocorrelations in demographic rates, using simulated and
   observed covariation among rates. We then test for differences in
   sensitivities, or changes of log lambda(s) to changes in autocorrelation
   among two major axes of life-history strategies, obtained from
   phylogenetically informed principal component analysis: the fast-slow
   and reproductive-strategy continua. Fast life histories exhibit highest
   sensitivities to simulated autocorrelation in demographic rates across
   reproductive strategies. Slow life histories are less sensitive to
   temporal autocorrelation, but their sensitivities increase among highly
   iteroparous species. We provide cross-taxonomic evidence that changes in
   the autocorrelation of environmental variation may affect a wide range
   of species, depending on complex interactions of life-history

Title = {{The evolution of male-biased sexual size dimorphism is associated with
   increased body size plasticity in males}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) can vary drastically across environments,
   demonstrating pronounced sex-specific plasticity. In insects, females
   are usually the larger and more plastic sex. However, the shortage of
   taxa with male-biased SSD hampers the assessment of whether the greater
   plasticity in females is driven by selection on size or represents an
   effect of the female reproductive role. Here, we specifically address
   the role of sex-specific plasticity of body size in the evolution of SSD
   reversals to disentangle sex and size effects.
   We first investigate sex-specific body size plasticity in Sepsis punctum
   and Sepsis neocynipsea as two independent cases of intraspecific SSD
   reversals in sepsid flies. In both species, directional variation in SSD
   between populations is driven by stronger sexual selection on male size.
   Using controlled laboratory breeding, we find evidence for sex-specific
   plasticity and increased condition dependence of male size in
   populations with male-biased SSD, but not of female size in populations
   with female-biased SSD.
   To extend the comparative scope, we next estimate sex-specific body size
   plasticity in eight additional fly species that differ in the direction
   of SSD under laboratory conditions. In all species with male-biased SSD
   we find males to be the more plastic sex, while this was only rarely the
   case in species with female-biased SSD, thus suggesting a more general
   trend in Diptera.
   To examine the generality of this pattern in holometabolous insects, we
   combine our data with data from the literature in a meta-analysis.
   Again, male body size tends to be more plastic than female size when
   males are the larger sex, though female size is now also generally more
   plastic when females are larger.
   Our findings indicate that primarily selection on size, rather than the
   reproductive role per se, drives the evolution of sex-specific body size
   plasticity. However, sepsid flies, and possibly Diptera in general, show
   a clear sexual asymmetry with greater male than female plasticity
   related to SSD, likely driven by strong sexual selection on males.
   Although further research controlling for phylogenetic and ecological
   confounding effects is needed, our findings are congruent with theory in
   suggesting that condition dependence plays a pivotal role in the
   evolution of sexual size dimorphism.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{The atmospheric correction of optical remote sensing data requires the
   determination of aerosol and gas optical properties. A method is
   presented which allows the detection of the aerosol scattering effects
   from optical remote sensing data at spatial sampling intervals below 5 m
   in cloud-free situations from cast shadow pixels. The derived aerosol
   optical thickness distribution is used for improved atmospheric
   compensation. In a first step, a novel spectral cast shadow detection
   algorithm determines the shadow areas using spectral indices. Evaluation
   of the cast shadow masks shows an overall classification accuracy on an
   80\% level. Using the such derived shadow map, the ATCOR atmospheric
   compensation method is iteratively applied on the shadow areas in order
   to find the optimum aerosol amount. The aerosol optical thickness is
   found by analyzing the physical atmospheric correction of fully shaded
   pixels in comparison to directly illuminated areas. The shadow based
   aerosol optical thickness estimation method (SHAOT) is tested on
   airborne imaging spectroscopy data as well as on photogrammetric data.
   The accuracy of the reflectance values from atmospheric correction using
   the such derived aerosol optical thickness could be improved from 3-4\%
   to a level of better than 2\% in reflectance for the investigated test

Abstract = {{Product lifetime is an essential aspect of dynamic material flow
   analyses and has been modeled using lifetime distribution functions,
   mostly average lifetimes. Existing data regarding the lifetime of
   electronic equipment (EE) are based on diverging definitions of lifetime
   as well as different temporal and regional scopes. After its active use,
   EE is often not disposed of immediately, but remains in storage for some
   time. Specific data on the share of EE that is stored and the time they
   remain in storage are scarce. This article investigates the service
   lifetime, storage time, and disposal pathways of ten electronic device
   types, based on data from an online survey complemented by structured
   interviews. We distinguish between new and secondhand devices and
   compute histograms, averages, and medians of the different lifetimes and
   their change over time. The average service lifetime varies from 3.3
   years for mobile phones to 10.8 years for large loudspeakers, the
   average storage time from 0.8 years for flat panel display televisions
   to 3.6 years for large loudspeakers. Most service lifetime histograms
   are positively skewed and show substantial differences among device
   types. The storage time histograms, being more similar to one another,

Abstract = {{Higher education institutions (HEIs) are, as a sector, an important
   actor in society and their role in sustainability transition has been
   acknowledged. However, their commitments to sustainability expressed
   through the adoption of various declarations are often not effective
   unless combined with other `internal' and `external' strategies
   (concerned with activities within and outside the institution,
   respectively). Networking is an example of the latter: universities
   enter into coalitions in order to discuss progress in sustainability
   implementation, exchange experience and formulate joint policies. The
   presented research explores the field of sustainability-oriented higher
   education networks, analyses their key areas of interest, inter-network
   relationships, links with the policy field, and (conditions for)
   cooperation in joint programs and strategy development. Based on
   information gained through desk-top research to map the field from 14 HE
   networks' web pages, a survey was designed and distributed to selected
   university networks, with 15 responses received (30\% response rate).
   Qualitative analysis of the data concentrated on the elements of social
   capital: the diversity of the networks, heterogeneity of the membership,
   size, regional scope and communication formats. The networks' activity
   areas range from those supporting sustainability initiatives within
   individual HEIs (education, research, campus operations, outreach) and
   networking initiatives directed beyond individual institutional change
   (contribution to policy debate at national, regional and global level,
   professional development and student network initiatives). The
   achievements of the analysed networks show a considerable contribution
   to the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD) in all
   their reported outcomes. Dialogue with key actors held after the
   exploratory mapping and the survey stages resulted in further
   delineation of the benefits and goals of cooperation: achievement of
   academia's cumulative impact on the sustainable development of our
   societies. This study highlights the significance of the autonomous
   character of HEIs based on data from 25 HE networks in total, and how
   they not only follow, but also stimulate the policy environment,
   consciously contributing to shared (sustainability) goals. Networking
   thus may be an important mechanism for systemic change in higher
   education, and the nature and role of social capital embedded in higher
   education networks should be the subject of further exploration. (C)

Abstract = {{The exchange rate of inorganic phosphorus (P) between the soil solution
   and solid phase, also known as soil solution P turnover, is essential
   for describing the kinetics of bioavailable P. While soil solution P
   turnover (K-m) can be determined by tracing radioisotopes in a
   soil-solution system, few studies have done so. We believe that this is
   due to a lack of understanding on how to derive K-m from isotopic
   exchange kinetic (IEK) experiments, a common form of radioisotope
   dilution study. Here, we provide a derivation of calculating K-m using
   parameters obtained from IEK experiments. We then calculated K-m for 217
   soils from published IEK experiments in terrestrial ecosystems, and also
   that of 18 long-term P fertilizer field experiments. Analysis of the
   global compilation data set revealed a negative relationship between
   concentrations of soil solution P and K-m. Furthermore, K-m buffered
   isotopically exchangeable P in soils with low concentrations of soil
   solution P. This finding was supported by an analysis of long-term P
   fertilizer field experiments, which revealed a negative relationship
   between K-m and phosphate-buffering capacity. Our study highlights the
   importance of calculating K-m for understanding the kinetics of P
   between the soil solid and solution phases where it is bioavailable. We
   argue that our derivation can also be used to calculate soil solution
   turnover of other environmentally relevant and strongly sorbing elements
   that can be traced with radioisotopes, such as zinc, cadmium, nickel,
   arsenic, and uranium.}},

Title = {{Ion Trapping of Amines in Protozoa: A Novel Removal Mechanism for
   Micropollutants in Activated Sludge}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{52-60}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{To optimize removal of organic micropollutants from the water cycle,
   understanding the processes during activated sludge treatment is
   essential. In this study, we hypothesize that aliphatic amines, which
   are highly abundant among organic micropollutants, are partly removed
   from the water phase in activated sludge through ion trapping in
   protozoa. In ion trapping, which has been extensively investigated in
   medical research, the neutral species of amine-containing compounds
   diffuse through the cell membrane and further into acidic vesicles
   present in eukaryotic cells such as protozoa. There they become trapped
   because diffusion of the positively charged species formed in the acidic
   vesicles is strongly hindered. We tested our hypothesis with two
   experiments. First, we studied the distribution of the fluorescent amine
   acridine orange in activated sludge by confocal fluorescence imaging. We
   observed intense fluorescence in distinct compartments of the protozoa,
   but not in the bacterial biomass. Second, we investigated the
   distribution of 12 amine-containing and eight control micropollutants in
   both regular activated sludge and sludge where the protozoa had been
   inactivated. In contrast to most control compounds, the amine-containing
   micropollutants displayed a distinctly different behavior in the
   noninhibited sludge compared to the inhibited one: (i) more removal from
   the liquid phase; (ii) deviation from first-order kinetics for the
   removal from the liquid phase; and (iii) higher amounts in the solid
   phase. These results provide strong evidence that ion trapping in
   protozoa occurs and that it is an important removal mechanism for
   amine-containing micropollutants in batch experiments with activated
   sludge that has so far gone unnoticed. We expect that our findings will
   trigger further investigations on the importance of this process in
   full-scale wastewater treatment systems, including its relevance for
   accumulation of ammonium.}},

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{22-32}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Understanding the consequences of spatial structure on ecological
   dynamics is a central theme in ecology. Recently, research has
   recognised the relevance of river and river-analogue network structures,
   because these systems are not only highly diverse but also rapidly
   changing due to habitat modifications or species invasions.
   2. Much of the previous work on ecological and evolutionary dynamics in
   metapopulations and metacommunities in dendritic river networks has been
   either using comparative approaches or was purely theoretical. However,
   the use of microcosm experiments provides the unique opportunity to
   study large-scale questions in a causal and experimental framework.
   3. We conducted replicated microcosm experiments, in which we
   manipulated the spatially explicit network configuration of a landscape
   and addressed how linear versus dendritic connectivity affects
   population dynamics, specifically the spatial distribution of population
   densities, and movement behaviour of the protist model organism
   Tetrahymena pyriformis. We tracked population densities and
   individual-level movement behaviour of thousands of individuals over
   time.
   4. At the end of the experiment, we found more variable population
   densities between patches in dendritic networks compared to linear
   networks, as predicted by theory. Specifically, in dendritic networks,
   population densities were higher at nodes that connected to headwaters
   compared to the headwaters themselves and to more central nodes in the
   network. These differences follow theoretical predictions and emerged
   from the different network topologies per se. These differences in
   population densities emerged despite weakly density-dependent movement.
   5. We show that differences in network structure alone can cause
   characteristic spatial variation in population densities. While such
   differences have been postulated by theoretical work and are the
   underlying precondition for differential dispersal evolution in
   heterogeneous networks, our results may be the first experimental
   demonstration thereof. Furthermore, these population-level dynamics may
   affect extinction risks and can upscale to previously shown
   metacommunity level diversity dynamics. Given that many species in
   natural river systems exhibit strong spatiotemporal patterns in
   population densities, our work suggests that abundance patterns should
   not only be addressed from a local environmental perspective, but may be
   the outcome of processes that are inherently driven by the respective
   habitat network structure.}},

Abstract = {{Glaciers and ice caps peripheral to the main Greenland Ice Sheet
   contribute markedly to sea-level rise(1-3). Their changes and
   variability, however, have been difficult to quantify on multi-decadal
   timescales due to an absence of long-term data(4). Here, using
   historical aerial surveys, expedition photographs, spy satellite imagery
   and new remote-sensing products, we map glacier length fluctuations of
   approximately 350 peripheral glaciers and ice caps in East and West
   Greenland since 1890. Peripheral glaciers are found to have recently
   undergone a widespread and significant retreat at rates of 12.2 m per
   year and 16.6 m per year in East and West Greenland, respectively; these
   changes are exceeded in severity only by the early twentieth century
   post-Little-Ice-Age retreat. Regional changes in ice volume, as
   reflected by glacier length, are further shown to be related to changes
   in precipitation associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO),
   with a distinct east-west asymmetry; positive phases of the NAO increase
   accumulation, and thereby glacier growth, in the eastern periphery,
   whereas opposite effects are observed in the western periphery. Thus,
   with projected trends towards positive NAO in the future(5,6), eastern
   peripheral glaciers may remain relatively stable, while western
   peripheral glaciers will continue to diminish.}},

   that Aenigmopteris dubia (the type species of the genus) and A. elegans
   are closely related and deeply imbedded in Tectaria. The other three
   species of genus are morphologically very similar; we therefore transfer
   all five known species into Tectaria. Detailed morphological comparison
   further shows that previously proposed diagnostic characters of
   Aenigmopteris fall within the range of variation of a broadly

Title = {{Beyond biomass: Soil feedbacks are transient over plant life stages and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{230-241}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Plants influence associated soil biotic communities that in turn can
   alter the performance of the subsequently growing plants. Although such
   plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) are considered as important drivers of plant
   community assembly, past PSF studies have mainly addressed plant biomass
   production. However, plant performance is not only the production of
   biomass but comprises a sequence of different life stages: from seed
   germination over vegetative growth up to the production of a viable
   progeny. Here, we assessed the effects of soil biotic communities that
   were previously conditioned for 3years by a focal plant species
   monoculture or species mixtures on key plant life stages from
   germination and vegetative growth to flowering and the production of
   viable seeds. We used three common grassland herb species that were
   grown in a sterile substrate and inoculated with a sterile control soil
   or with living soils. Living soils were conditioned either by the focal
   species in monoculture or a four- or eight-species mixture that included
   the focal species to represent a decrease in the target plants'
   conspecific influence on the soil communities. We show that the effect
   of soil biota changed from positive at the plants' juvenile life stages
   to neutral or negative at the plants' adult life stages and ultimately
   decreased plant fitness. A higher conspecific influence on the soil
   communities pronounced the positive effects at the juvenile life stage
   but also the negative effects at adult life stages. Further, we observed
   direct soil biotic effects on flower production and plant fitness that
   were not mediated by adult biomass production. This suggests that soil
   biotic effects may alter plant resource allocation and even may have
   transgenerational effects on plant fitness.Synthesis. We conclude that
   there is no overarching effect of soil biota that remains consistent at
   all the life stages of a plant. Thus, our results highlight the
   importance to consider plant life stage and ultimately plant fitness
   especially when plant-soil interactions are used to explain plant
   community dynamics.}},

Pages = {{538-556}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{It is expected that an increasing proportion of the precipitation will
   fall as rain in alpine catchments in the future. Consequently, snow
   storage is expected to decrease, which, together with changes in
   snowmelt rates and timing, might cause reductions in spring and summer
   low flows. The objectives of this study were (1) to simulate the effect
   of changing snow storage on low flows during the warm seasons and (2) to
   relate drought sensitivity to the simulated snow storage changes at
   different elevations. The Swiss Climate Change Scenarios 2011 data set
   was used to derive future changes in air temperature and precipitation.
   A typical bucket-type catchment model, HBV-light, was applied to 14
   mountain catchments in Switzerland to simulate streamflow and snow in
   the reference period and three future periods. The largest relative
   decrease in annual maximum SWE was simulated for elevations below 2,200
   m a.s.l. (60-75\% for the period 2070-2099) and the snowmelt season
   shifted by up to 4 weeks earlier. The relative decrease in spring and
   summer minimum runoff that was caused by the relative decrease in
   maximum SWE (i.e., elasticity), reached 40-90\% in most of catchments
   for the reference period and decreased for the future periods. This
   decreasing elasticity indicated that the effect of snow on summer low
   flows is reduced in the future. The fraction of snowmelt runoff in
   summer decreased by more than 50\% at the highest elevations and almost
   disappeared at the lowest elevations. This might have large implications
   on water availability during the summer.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity ensures ecosystem functioning and provisioning of ecosystem
   services, but it remains unclear how biodiversity-ecosystem
   multifunctionality relationships depend on the identity and number of
   functions considered. Here, we demonstrate that ecosystem
   multifunctionality, based on 82 indicator variables of ecosystem
   functions in a grassland biodiversity experiment, increases strongly
   with increasing biodiversity. Analysing subsets of functions showed that
   the effects of biodiversity on multifunctionality were stronger when
   more functions were included and that the strength of the biodiversity
   effects depended on the identity of the functions included. Limits to
   multifunctionality arose from negative correlations among functions and
   functions that were not correlated with biodiversity. Our findings
   underline that the management of ecosystems for the protection of
   biodiversity cannot be replaced by managing for particular ecosystem
   functions or services and emphasize the need for specific management to
   protect biodiversity. More plant species from the experimental pool of
   60 species contributed to functioning when more functions were
   considered. An individual contribution to multifunctionality could be
   demonstrated for only a fraction of the species.}},

Abstract = {{This study documents the current state of glacier coverage in the
   Colombian Andes, the glacier shrinkage over the twentieth century and
   discusses indication of their disappearance in the coming decades.
   Satellite images have been used to update the glacier inventory of
   Colombia reflecting an overall glacier extent of about 42.4 +/-
   0.71km(2) in 2016 distributed in four glacierized mountain ranges.
   Combining these data with older inventories, we show that the current
   extent is 36\% less than in the mid-1990s, 62\% less than in the
   mid-twentieth century and almost 90\% less than the Little Ice Age
   maximum extent. Focusing on Nevado Santa Isabel (Los Nevados National
   Park), aerial photographs from 1987 and 2005 combined with a terrestrial
   LiDAR survey show that the mass loss of the former ice cap, which is
   nowadays parceled into several small glaciers, was about -2.5 m w.e.
   yr(-1) during the last three decades. Radar measurements performed on
   one of the remnant glaciers, La Conejeras glacier, show that the ice
   thickness is limited (about 22 m in average in 2014) and that with such
   a mass loss rate, the glacier should disappear in the coming years.
   Considering their imbalance with the current climate conditions, their
   limited altitudinal extent and reduced accumulation areas, and in view
   of temperature increase expected in future climate scenarios, most of
   the Colombian glaciers will likely disappear in the coming decades. Only
   the largest ones located on the highest summits will probably persist
   until the second half of the twenty-first century although very reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition that evolution operates on the same timescale as ecological
   processes has motivated growing interest in eco-evolutionary dynamics.
   Nonetheless, generating sufficient data to test predictions about
   eco-evolutionary dynamics has proved challenging, particularly in
   natural contexts. Here we argue that genomic data can be integrated into
   the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics in ways that deepen our
   understanding of the interplay between ecology and evolution.
   Specifically, we outline five major questions in the study of
   eco-evolutionary dynamics for which genomic data may provide answers.
   Although genomic data alone will not be sufficient to resolve these
   challenges, integrating genomic data can provide a more mechanistic
   understanding of the causes of phenotypic change, help elucidate the
   mechanisms driving eco-evolutionary dynamics, and lead to more accurate
   evolutionary predictions of eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature.}},

Pages = {{408-419}},
Abstract = {{Modeling and simulation are recognized as effective tools for management
   and decision support across various disciplines; however, poor
   communication of results to the end users is a major obstacle for
   properly using and understanding model output. Visualizations can play
   an essential role in making modeling results accessible for management
   and decision-making. Virtual reality (VR) and virtual geographic
   environments (VGEs) are popular and potentially very rewarding ways to
   visualize socio-environmental models. However, there is a fundamental
   conflict between abstraction and realism: models are goal-driven, and
   created to simplify reality and to focus on certain crucial aspects of
   the system; VR, in the meanwhile, by definition, attempts to replicate
   reality as closely as possible. This elevated realism may add to the
   complexity curse in modeling, and the message might be diluted by too
   many (background) details. This is also connected to information
   overload and cognitive load. Moreover, modeling is always associated
   with the treatment of uncertainty - something difficult to present in
   VR. In this paper, we examine the use of VR and, specifically, VGEs in
   socio-environmental modeling, and discuss how VGEs and simulation
   modeling can be married in a mutually beneficial way that makes VGEs
   more effective for users, while enhancing simulation models.}},

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{The Lower Grindelwald Glacier (Bernese Oberland, Switzerland) consists
   of two parts, the Ischmeer in the east (disconnected) and the Bernese
   Fiescher Glacier in the west. During the Little Ice Age (LIA), the
   glacier terminated either in the area of the ``Schopffelsen{''}
   (landmark rock terraces) or advanced at least six times (ten times if we
   include early findings) even further down into the valley bottom forming
   the ``Schweif{''} (tail). Maximal ice extensions were reached in 1602
   and 1855/56 AD. The years after the end of the LIA have been dominated
   by a dramatic melting of ice, especially after 2000. The Mer de Glace
   (Mont Blanc area, France) is a compound valley glacier formed by the
   tributaries Glacier du Tacul, Glacier de Leschaux, and Glacier de
   Talefre (disconnected). During the LIA, the Mer de Glace nearly
   continuously reached the plain in the Chamonix Valley (maximal
   extensions in 1644 and 1821 AD). The retreat, beginning in the
   mid-1850s, was followed by a relatively stable position of the front
   (1880s until 1930s). Afterwards the retreat has continued until today,
   especially impressive after 1995. The perception of glaciers in the
   early times was dominated by fear. In the age of Enlightenment and later
   in the 19th century, it changed to fascination. In the 20th century,
   glaciers became a top attraction of the Alps, but today they are
   disappearing from sight. With a huge number of high-quality pictorial
   documents, it is possible to reconstruct the LIA history of many
   glaciers in the European Alps from the 17th to the 19th centuries.
   Thanks to these pictures, we get an image of the beauty and fascination
   of LIA glaciers, ending down in the valleys. The pictorial documents
   (drawings, paintings, prints, photographs, and maps) of important
   artists (Caspar Wolf, Jean-Antoine Linck, Samuel Birmann) promoted a
   rapidly growing tourism. Compared with today's situations, it gives
   totally different landscapes - a comparison of LIA images with the same
   views of today is probably the best visual proof for the changes in
   climate.}},

Abstract = {{Humans engage in cooperative childcare, which includes some elements not
   found in other animals, such as the presence of post-reproductive
   helpers, extensive food sharing among adults and a pervasive sexual
   division of labour. In animals, cooperative offspring care has typically
   been studied in two different contexts. The first mainly involves
   helpers contributing care in cooperatively breeding family groups; the
   second context is allomaternal care in species usually not categorized
   as cooperative breeders (e.g. plural and communal breeders, often
   without male care). Comparative analyses suggest that cooperative
   breeding and allomaternal care in plural and communal breeders have
   distinct evolutionary origins, with humans fitting neither pathway
   entirely. Nevertheless, some critical proximate mechanisms of helping,
   including hormonal regulators, are likely to be shared across species.
   Other mechanisms may vary among species, such as social tolerance,
   proactive prosociality or conditional mother-infant bonding. These are
   presumably associated with specific details of the care system, such as
   whether all group members contribute, or whether mothers can potentially
   raise offspring alone. Thus, cooperative offspring care is seen in
   different contexts across animal lineages, but may nonetheless share
   several important psychological characteristics. We end by discussing
   how work on humans may play a unifying role in studying cooperative
   offspring care.}},

Abstract = {{Forest cover in Switzerland and other European countries has gradually
   increased in the past century. Our knowledge of the impacts of forest
   expansion and development on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is,
   however, limited due to uncertainties in land-use history and lack of
   historical soil samples. We investigated the effect of forest age on
   current SOC storage in Switzerland. For 857 sites, we analysed SOC
   stocks and determined the minimal forest age for all presently forested
   sites using digitized historical maps, classifying all sites into three
   categories: young (<= 60 years), medium (60-120 years), and old (>= 120
   years) forests. Grassland was the primary previous use of afforested
   land. Forest age affected current SOC stocks only moderately, whereas
   climate, soil chemistry, and tree species exerted a stronger impact. In
   the organic layer, highest SOC stocks were found in medium sites (3.0
   +/- 0.3 kg C m(-2)). As compared to other age categories, these sites
   had a 10\% higher cover in coniferous forests with higher organic layer
   C stocks than broadleaf forests. SOC stocks in mineral soils decreased
   with increasing forest age (12.5 +/- 0.9, 11.4 +/- 0.5, 10.5 +/- 0.3 kg
   C m(-2)). This decrease was primarily related to a 200-m higher average
   elevation of young sites and higher SOC stocks in a colder and more
   humid climate. In summary, forest age has only a minor effect on SOC
   storage in Swiss forest soils. Therefore, ongoing forest expansion in
   mountainous regions of Europe is unlikely contributing to soil C
   sequestration.}},

Abstract = {{The pervasive influence of human induced global environmental change
   affects biodiversity across the globe, and there is great uncertainty as
   to how the biosphere will react on short and longer time scales. To
   adapt to what the future holds and to manage the impacts of global
   change, scientists need to predict the expected effects with some
   confidence and communicate these predictions to policy makers. However,
   recent reviews found that we currently lack a clear understanding of how
   predictable ecology is, with views seeing it as mostly unpredictable to
   potentially predictable, at least over short time frames. However, in
   applied, ecology-related fields predictions are more commonly formulated
   and reported, as well as evaluated in hindsight, potentially allowing
   one to define baselines of predictive proficiency in these fields. We
   searched the literature for representative case studies in these fields
   and collected information about modeling approaches, target variables of
   prediction, predictive proficiency achieved, as well as the availability
   of data to parameterize predictive models. We find that some fields such
   as epidemiology achieve high predictive proficiency, but even in the
   more predictive fields proficiency is evaluated in different ways. Both
   phenomenological and mechanistic approaches are used in most fields, but
   differences are often small, with no clear superiority of one approach
   over the other. Data availability is limiting in most fields, with
   long-term studies being rare and detailed data for parameterizing
   mechanistic models being in short supply. We suggest that ecologists
   adopt a more rigorous approach to report and assess predictive
   proficiency, and embrace the challenges of real world decision making to
   strengthen the practice of prediction in ecology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Niche complementarity and competitive disparity are driving mechanisms
   behind plant community assembly and productivity. Consequently, there is
   great interest in predicting species complementarity and their
   competitive differences from their functional traits as dissimilar
   species may compete less and result in more complete use of resources.
   Here we assessed the role of trait dissimilarities for species
   complementarity and competitive disparities within an experimental
   gradient of plant species richness and functional trait dissimilarity.
   Communities were assembled using three pools of grass and forb species
   based on a priori knowledge of traits related to (1) above- and
   below-ground spatial differences in resource acquisition, (2)
   phenological differences or (3) both. Complementarity and competitive
   disparities were assessed by partitioning the overyielding in mixed
   species communities into species complementarity and dominance effects.
   Community overyielding and the underlying complementarity and
   competitive dominance varied strongly among the three plant species
   pools. Overyielding and complementarity were greatest among species that
   were assembled based on their variation in both spatial and phenological
   traits. Competitive dominance was greatest when species were assembled
   based on spatial resource acquisition traits alone. In communities that
   were assembled based on species variation in only spatial or
   phenological traits, greater competitive dominance was predicted by
   greater differences in SLA and flowering initiation respectively, while
   greater complementarity was predicted by greater dissimilarity in leaf
   area and flowering senescence respectively. Greater differences in leaf
   area could also be linked to greater species complementarity in
   communities assembled based on variation in both phenological and
   spatial traits, but trait dissimilarity was unrelated to competitive
   dominance in these communities. Our results indicate that
   complementarity and competitive disparity among species are both driven
   by trait dissimilarities. However, the identity of the traits that
   drives the complementarity and competitive disparity depends on the
   trait variation among species that comprise the community. Moreover, we
   demonstrate that communities assembled with the greater variation in
   both spatial and phenological traits show the greatest complementarity
   among species.

Abstract = {{Although the monitoring and prediction of ecosystem dynamics under
   global change have been extensively assessed, large gaps remain in our
   knowledge, including a need for concepts in rapid evolution and
   phenotypic plasticity, and a lack of large-scale and long-term
   monitoring. Recent genomic studies using the model species Arabidopsis
   predict that plastic and evolutionary changes in phenology may affect
   plant reproduction. We propose that three genomic-scale methods would
   enhance global change studies. First, genome-wide RNA sequencing enables
   monitoring of diverse functional traits and phenology. Second,
   sequencing of DNA variants highlights the importance of genetic
   variation and evolution. Third, DNA metabarcoding provides efficient and
   unbiased ecosystem monitoring. Integrating these genomic-scale studies
   with remote sensing will promote the understanding and prediction of
   biodiversity change.}},

Abstract = {{Coevolution with avian brood parasites shapes a range of traits in their
   hosts, including morphology, behavior, and breeding systems. Here we
   explore whether brood parasitism is also associated with the evolution
   of host clutch size. Several studies have proposed that hosts of highly
   virulent parasites could decrease the costs of parasitism by evolving a
   smaller clutch size, because hosts with smaller clutches will lose fewer
   progeny when their clutch is parasitized. We describe a model of the
   evolution of clutch size, which challenges this logic and shows instead
   that an increase in clutch size (or no change) should evolve in hosts.
   We test this prediction using a broad-scale comparative analysis to ask
   whether there are differences in clutch size within hosts and between
   hosts and nonhosts. Consistent with our model, this analysis revealed
   that host species do not have smaller clutches and that hosts that incur
   larger costs from raising a parasite lay larger clutches. We suggest
   that brood parasitism might be an influential factor in clutch-size
   evolution and could potentially select for the evolution of larger
   clutches in host species.}},

Abstract = {{Occasional periods of drought are typical of most tropical forests, but
   climate change is increasing drought frequency and intensity in many
   areas across the globe, threatening the structure and function of these
   ecosystems. The effects of intermittent drought on tropical tree
   communities remain poorly understood and the potential impacts of
   intensified drought under future climatic conditions are even less well
   known. The response of forests to altered precipitation will be
   determined by the tolerances of different species to reduced water
   availability and the interactions among plants that alleviate or
   exacerbate the effects of drought. Here, we report the response of
   experimental monocultures and mixtures of tropical trees to simulated
   drought, which reveals a fundamental shift in the nature of interactions
   among species. Weaker competition for water in diverse communities
   allowed seedlings to maintain growth under drought while more intense
   competition among conspecifics inhibited growth under the same
   conditions. These results show that reduced competition for water among
   species in mixtures mediates community resistance to drought. The
   delayed onset of competition for water among species in more diverse
   neighbourhoods during drought has potential implications for the
   coexistence of species in tropical forests and the resilience of these
   systems to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of the wheat Lr34 multipathogen resistance gene (Lr34res) to
   function across a wide taxonomic boundary was investigated in transgenic
   Sorghum bicolor. Increased resistance to sorghum rust and anthracnose
   disease symptoms following infection with the biotrophic pathogen
   Puccinia purpurea and the hemibiotroph Colletotrichum sublineolum,
   respectively, occurred in transgenic plants expressing the Lr34res ABC
   transporter. Transgenic sorghum lines that highly expressed the wheat
   Lr34res gene exhibited immunity to sorghum rust compared to the
   low-expressing single copy Lr34res genotype that conferred partial
   resistance. Pathogen-induced pigmentation mediated by flavonoid
   phytoalexins was evident on transgenic sorghum leaves following P.
   purpurea infection within 24-72 h, which paralleled Lr34res gene
   expression. Elevated expression of flavone synthase II, flavanone
   4-reductase and dihydroflavonol reductase genes which control the
   biosynthesis of flavonoid phytoalexins characterized the highly
   expressing Lr34res transgenic lines 24-h post-inoculation with P.
   purpurea. Metabolite analysis of mesocotyls infected with C. sublineolum
   showed increased levels of 3-deoxyanthocyanidin metabolites were
   associated with Lr34res expression, concomitant with reduced symptoms of
   anthracnose.}},

Abstract = {{In agricultural ecosystems, pest insects, pathogens, and reduced soil
   fertility pose major challenges to crop productivity and are responsible
   for significant yield losses worldwide. Management of belowground pests
   and diseases remains particularly challenging due to the complex nature
   of the soil and the limited reach of conventional agrochemicals.
   Boosting the presence of beneficial rhizosphere organisms is a
   potentially sustainable alternative and may help to optimize crop health
   and productivity. Field application of single beneficial soil organisms
   has shown satisfactory results under optimal conditions. This might be
   further enhanced by combining multiple beneficial soil organisms, but
   this remains poorly investigated. Here, we inoculated wheat plots with
   combinations of three beneficial soil organisms that have different
   rhizosphere functions and studied their effects on crop performance.
   Plant beneficial Pseudomonas bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF), and entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN), were inoculated
   individually or in combinations at seeding, and their effects on plant
   performance were evaluated throughout the season. We used traditional
   and molecular identification tools to monitor their persistence over the
   cropping season in augmented and control treatments, and to estimate the
   possible displacement of native populations. In three separate trials,
   beneficial soil organisms were successfully introduced into the native
   populations and readily survived the field conditions. Various
   Pseudornonas, mycorrhiza, and nematode treatments improved plant health
   and productivity, while their combinations provided no significant
   additive or synergistic benefits compared to when applied alone. EPN
   application temporarily displaced some of the native EPN, but had no
   significant long-term effect on the associated food web. The strongest
   positive effect on wheat survival was observed for Pseudomonas and AMF
   during a season with heavy natural infestation by the frit fly,
   Oscinella frit, a major pest of cereals. Hence, beneficial impacts
   differed between the beneficial soil organisms and were most evident for
   plants under biotic stress. Overall, our findings indicate that in wheat
   production under the test conditions the three beneficial soil organisms
   can establish nicely and are compatible, but their combined application
   provides no additional benefits. Further studies are required, also in
   other cropping systems, to fine-tune the functional interactions among
   beneficial soil organisms, crops, and the environment.}},

Abstract = {{We studied species richness and community composition as well as the
   vertical distribution of ferns and lycophytes in three forest types
   along an elevational gradient in the region of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We
   established 23 plots of 20 m x 20 m at 150-1650 m, recording
   presence-absence of all species in eight vertical distribution zones
   (terrestrial and seven epiphytic zones). We found 84 species, including
   79 ferns and five lycophytes. Species richness patterns differed
   markedly between different vertical zones, with the forest understory
   having a high diversity of epiphytes, many of which were specialized to
   this habitat. Overall species richness increased with elevation, but the
   richness of ground-living, terrestrial species showed the lowest
   elevational increase by only 50\%, whereas epiphytic richness increased
   fourfold to tenfold. These differences presumably reflect the stronger
   influence of increasing environmental humidity on the water-limited
   epiphytic assemblages. We also found that the degree of habitat
   specialization of epiphytes decreased with elevation. This probably is
   due to decreasing tree height and increasing overall humidity, reducing
   the microclimatic differences between the forest interior and canopy.
   This elevational decrease in habitat specialization raises important
   questions as to, e.g., the strength of competitive interactions or the
   possibility that the evolutionary transition from terrestrial to
   epiphytic growth forms is more easily achieved at higher elevations.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The application of structure-from-motion (SfM) to generate digital
   terrain models (DTMs) derived from different image sources has strongly
   increased, the major reason for this being that processing is
   substantially easier with SfM than with conventional photogrammetry. To
   test the functionality in a demanding environment, we applied SfM and
   conventional photogrammetry to archival aerial images from
   Zmuttgletscher, a mountain glacier in Switzerland, for nine dates
   between 1946 and 2005 using the most popular software packages, and
   compared the results regarding bundle adjustment and final DTM quality.
   The results suggest that by using SfM it is possible to produce DTMs of
   similar quality as with conventional photogrammetry. Higher point cloud
   density and less noise allow a higher ground resolution of the final
   DTM, and the time effort from the user is 3-6 times smaller, while the
   controls of the commercial software packages Agisoft PhotoScan (Version
   1.2; Agisoft, St. Petersburg, Russia) and Pix4Dmapper (Version 3.0;
   Pix4D, Lausanne, Switzerland) are limited in comparison to ERDAS
   photogrammetry. SfM performs less reliably when few images with little
   overlap are processed. Even though SfM facilitates the largely automated
   production of high quality DTMs, the user is not exempt from a thorough
   quality check, at best with reference data where available. The
   resulting DTM time series revealed an average change in surface
   elevation at the glacier tongue of -67.0 +/- 5.3 m. The spatial pattern
   of changes over time reflects the influence of flow dynamics and the
   melt of clean ice and that under debris cover. With continued
   technological advances, we expect to see an increasing use of SfM in
   glaciology for a variety of purposes, also in processing archival aerial

Abstract = {{Several evolutionary processes shape the genetic and phenotypic
   differentiation of populations. Among them, the joint effects of gene
   flow, selection and phenotypic plasticity are poorly known, especially
   when trying to understand how maladaptive plasticity affects population
   divergence. We extended a quantitative genetic model of Hendry et al.
   (2001) to describe these joint effects on phenotypic and additive
   genetic divergence between two populations, and their phenotypic and
   genetic differentiation (PST and QST). With individual-based
   simulations, we tested our model predictions and further modeled allelic
   differentiation at neutral (FST) and adaptive (FSTQ) loci. While
   adaptive phenotypic plasticity allows for large phenotypic divergence
   and differentiation despite high gene flow, maladaptive plasticity
   promotes genetic divergence and generates countergradient variation,
   under extensive migration with phenotypic differences sometimes opposed
   to genetic differences. Maladaptive plasticity can also promote adaptive
   phenotypic divergence by reducing the effective gene flow. Overall,
   plasticity decouples genetic from phenotypic differences between
   populations, and blurs the correlation between phenotypic divergence and
   local adaptation. By deriving models of population differentiation for
   three different life cycles, we further describe the effect of a
   species' ecology on evolution in structured populations.}},

Abstract = {{In cooperative breeders, aggression from dominant breeders directed at
   subordinates may raise subordinate stress hormone (glucocorticoid)
   concentrations. This may benefit dominants by suppressing subordinate
   reproduction but it is uncertain whether aggression from dominants can
   elevate subordinate cooperative behaviour, or how resulting changes in
   subordinate glucocorticoid concentrations affect their cooperative
   behaviour. We show here that the effects of manipulating glucocorticoid
   concentrations in wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) on cooperative
   behaviour varied between cooperative activities as well as between the
   sexes. Subordinates of both sexes treated with a glucocorticoid receptor
   antagonist (mifepristone) exhibited significantly more pup protection
   behaviour (babysitting) compared to those treated with glucocorticoids
   (cortisol) or controls. Females treated with mifepristone had a higher
   probability of exhibiting pup food provisioning (pup-feeding) compared
   to those treated with cortisol. In males, there were no treatment
   effects on the probability of pup-feeding, but those treated with
   cortisol gave a higher proportion of the food they found to pups than
   those treated with mifepristone. Using 19 years of behavioural data, we
   also show that dominant females did not increase the frequency with
   which they directed aggression at subordinates at times when the need
   for assistance was highest. Our results suggest that it is unlikely that
   dominant females manipulate the cooperative behaviour of subordinates
   through the effects of aggression on their glucocorticoid levels and
   that the function of aggression directed at subordinates is probably to
   reduce the probability they will breed.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals in a population vary in their growth due to hidden and
   observed factors such as age, genetics, environment, disease, and
   carryover effects from past environments. Because size affects fitness,
   growth trajectories scale up to affect population dynamics. However, it
   can be difficult to estimate growth in data from wild populations with
   missing observations and observation error. Previous work has shown that
   linear mixed models (LMMs) underestimate hidden individual heterogeneity
   when more than 25\% of repeated measures are missing. Here we
   demonstrate a flexible and robust way to model growth trajectories. We
   show that state-space models (SSMs), fit using R package growmod, are
   far less biased than LMMs when fit to simulated data sets with missing
   repeated measures and observation error. This method is much faster than
   Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, allowing more models to be tested in a
   shorter time. For the scenarios we simulated, SSMs gave estimates with
   little bias when up to 87.5\% of repeated measures were missing. We use
   this method to quantify growth of Soay sheep, using data froma
   long-termmark-recapture study, and demonstrate that growth decreased
   with age, population density, weather conditions, and when individuals
   are reproductive. The method improves our ability to quantify how growth
   varies among individuals in response to their attributes and the
   environments they experience, with particular relevance for wild
   populations.}},

Title = {{Copy number increases of transposable elements and protein-coding genes

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{4712-4724}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary dynamics of structural genetic variation in lineages of
   hybrid origin is not well explored, although structural mutations may
   increase in controlled hybrid crosses. We therefore tested whether
   structural variants accumulate in a fish of recent hybrid origin,
   invasive Cottus, relative to both parental species Cottus rhenanus and
   Cottus perifretum. Copy-number variation in exons of 10,979 genes was
   assessed using comparative genome hybridization arrays. Twelve genes
   showed significantly higher copy numbers in invasive Cottus compared to
   both parents. This coincided with increased expression for three genes
   related to vision, detoxification and muscle development, suggesting
   possible gene dosage effects. Copy number increases of putative
   transposons were assessed by comparative mapping of genomic DNA reads
   against a de novo assembly of 1,005 repetitive elements. In contrast to
   exons, copy number increases of repetitive elements were common (20.7\%)
   in invasive Cottus, whereas decrease was very rare (0.01\%). Among the
   increased repetitive elements, 53.8\% occurred at higher numbers in C.
   perifretum compared to C. rhenanus, while only 1.4\% were more abundant
   in C. rhenanus. This implies a biased mutational process that amplifies
   genetic material from one ancestor. To assess the frequency of de novo
   mutations through hybridization, we screened 64 laboratory-bred F-2
   offspring between the parental species for copy-number changes at five
   candidate loci. We found no evidence for new structural variants,
   indicating that they are too rare to be detected given our sampling
   scheme. Instead, they must have accumulated over more generations than
   we observed in a controlled cross.}},

Abstract = {{The interrelation of Alpine topography with the micro and mesobiota is
   still poorly understood. We investigated the effects of ground cover
   type and slope exposure on the soil microbial biomass (double-stranded
   DNA, dsDNA) and abundances (real time PCR, qPCR); hydrolytic enzyme
   activities; and enchytraeid community structure in top soils (2.5-cm
   increments depth) in subalpine forests in the Italian Alps. Dominant
   ground covers were grass, moss, litter and woody debris at the north-
   and the south-facing slopes. The autochthonous soil microbiota
   (bacteria, fungi and archaea) was quantified by qPCR in the
   extracellular (eDNA) and intracellular fraction (iDNA) of the total soil
   DNA pool. A higher eDNA/iDNA ratio indicative of lower microbial
   activity was recorded in the deepest layer of the grass plots at the
   north-facing slope. This can be related to a lower degradation of eDNA
   and/or to an accumulation of eDNA with increasing depth as a result of
   leaching. The exposure effect was enzyme-specific and higher activities
   occurred under woody debris primarily at the south facing slope. These
   plots also showed a higher nutrient content and a greater microbial
   biomass assessed as dsDNA yields. Total microannelid abundance was
   elevated on north-facing slopes on account of strong acidity indicator
   species. This was related to soil pH being one unit lower compared to
   the south-facing slope. The thickness of the organic layer (OL + OF +
   OH) was elevated at the north-facing slope due to a considerably thicker
   OH-horizon. The vast majority of microannelids at this slope occurred in
   the organic layer, while at south exposure they were almost evenly
   distributed between the organic layer and the mineral soil (A-horizon).
   Exposure was found to be more determinative for the composition of
   microannelid assemblages than the ground cover type.}},

   main hypotheses have been proposed: selection against individuals
   containing different mtDNAs (heteroplasmy) and selection against selfish
   mtDNA mutations. Recently, uniparental inheritance was shown to promote
   adaptive evolution in mtDNA, potentially providing a third hypothesis
   for its evolution. Here, we explore this hypothesis theoretically and
   ask if the accumulation of beneficial mutations provides a sufficient
   fitness advantage for uniparental inheritance to invade a population in
   which mtDNA is inherited biparentally. In a deterministic model,
   uniparental inheritance increases in frequency but cannot replace
   biparental inheritance if only a single beneficial mtDNA mutation sweeps
   through the population. When we allow successive selective sweeps of
   mtDNA, however, uniparental inheritance can replace biparental
   inheritance. Using a stochastic model, we show that a combination of
   selection and drift facilitates the fixation of uniparental inheritance
   (compared to a neutral trait) when there is only a single selective
   mtDNA sweep. When we consider multiple mtDNA sweeps in a stochastic
   model, uniparental inheritance becomes even more likely to replace
   biparental inheritance. Our findings thus suggest that selective sweeps
   of beneficial mtDNA haplotypes can drive the evolution of uniparental
   inheritance.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This research presents a methodology to characterize life cycle
   impact data (LCIA) of alternative construction materials outside of the
   European context.
   Methods This methodology was based on the characterization of data and
   life cycle assessment (LCA) using geographic information systems (GIS),
   which has been proposed as an effective alternative for this purpose.
   The data were characterized at three levels: global, represented by
   different production efficiency of materials; regional, represented by
   the type of electricity mix used in the production and the national
   transport at the country level; and local, represented by external
   factors, such as seismic and wind risk zones at the city level. A
   comparative LCA was used as case study to test the methodology. The
   functional unit for the LCA was defined as an 18 m(2) core shelter unit
   consisting of structural elements only. The bill of materials for five
   designs were calculated, each using a distinctive construction material:
   bamboo, brick, concrete hollow block, ferro-cement panels, and
   soil-stabilised bricks. The contributions' variability and uncertainty
   analysis were used to validate the consistency of the results. The
   effect of the external constraints (earthquakes and wind) were analysed,
   and the environmental impact over the whole life cycle was assessed.
   Five house designs were calculated in twenty locations based on three
   levels of production efficiency and three transport distance ranges for
   each country.
   Results and discussion The results of the bamboo, concrete hollow block
   and ferro-cement houses overlapped and changed depending on the
   construction materials' transport distance. Therefore, the level of
   impact of an average bamboo house can also be achieved by a
   high-performance block or ferro-cement house. The results showed that in
   most cases, the buildings with high technical performance can be
   achieved with low environmental impacts.
   Conclusions The use of GIS enables the development of characterized LCIA
   data for construction materials and buildings with a high degree of
   consistency. Moreover, the proposed approach was able to accurately
   represent the range of production practices used outside Europe.
   Finally, the use of the proposed methodology allows for the assessment
   of building in the early stages of design when uncertainty is at its
   highest, thereby identifying the improvement potential of each design
   and recognising the structural needs in specific locations.}},

Abstract = {{Glaciers in the Arctic are losing mass at an increasing rate. Here we
   use surface topography derived from Structure from Motion (SfM) and ice
   volume from ground penetrating radar (GPR) to describe the 2014 state of
   Aqqutikitsoq glacier (2.85 km(2)) on Greenland's west coast. A
   photogrammetrically derived 1985 digital elevation model (DEM) was
   subtracted from a 2014 DEM obtained using land-based SfM to calculate
   geodetic glacier mass balance. Furthermore, a detailed 2014 ground
   penetrating radar survey was performed to assess ice volume. From 1985
   to 2014, the glacier has lost 49.8 +/- 9.4 10(6) m(3) of ice,
   corresponding to roughly a quarter of its 1985 volume (148.6 +/- 47.6
   106 m(3)) and a thinning rate of 0.60 +/- 0.11 m a(-1). The computations
   are challenged by a relatively large fraction of the 1985 DEM (similar
   to 50\% of the glacier surface) being deemed unreliable owing to low
   contrast (snow cover) in the 1985 aerial photography. To address this
   issue, surface elevation in low contrast areas was measured manually at
   point locations and interpolated using a universal kriging approach. We
   conclude that ground-based SfM is well suited to establish high-quality
   DEMs of smaller glaciers. Provided favorable topography, the approach
   constitutes a viable alternative where the use of drones is not
   possible. Our investigations constitute the first glacier on Greenland's
   west coast where ice volume was determined and volume change calculated.
   The glacier's thinning rate is comparable to, for example, the Swiss
   Alps and underlines that arctic glaciers are subject to fast changes.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Among the world's three major nectar-feeding bird taxa, hummingbirds
   are the most phenotypically specialized for nectarivory, followed by
   sunbirds, while the honeyeaters are the least phenotypically specialized
   taxa. We tested whether this phenotypic specialization gradient is also
   found in the interaction patterns with their floral resources.
   Location Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania/Australia.
   Methods We compiled interaction networks between birds and floral
   resources for 79 hummingbird, nine sunbird and 33 honeyeater
   communities. Interaction specialization was quantified through
   connectance (C), complementary specialization (H-2), binary (Q(B)) and
   weighted modularity (Q), with both observed and null-model corrected
   values. We compared interaction specialization among the three types of
   bird-flower communities, both independently and while controlling for
   potential confounding variables, such as plant species richness,
   asymmetry, latitude, insularity, topography, sampling methods and
   intensity.
   Results Hummingbird-flower networks were more specialized than
   honeyeater-flower networks. Specifically, hummingbird-flower networks
   had a lower proportion of realized interactions (lower C), decreased
   niche overlap (greater H-2) and greater modularity (greater Q(B)).
   However, we found no significant differences between hummingbird- and
   sunbird-flower networks, nor between sunbird- and honeyeater-flower
   networks.
   Main conclusions As expected, hummingbirds and their floral resources
   have greater interaction specialization than honeyeaters, possibly
   because of greater phenotypic specialization and greater floral resource
   richness in the New World. Interaction specialization in sunbird-flower
   communities was similar to both hummingbird-flower and honeyeater-flower
   communities. This may either be due to the relatively small number of
   sunbird-flower networks available, or because sunbird-flower communities
   share features of both hummingbird-flower communities (specialized
   floral shapes) and honeyeater-flower communities (fewer floral
   resources). These results suggest a link between interaction
   specialization and both phenotypic specialization and floral resource
   richness within bird-flower communities at a global scale.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on the evolution of cooperative behaviour are typically confined
   to understanding its adaptive value. It is equally essential, however,
   to understand its potential to evolve, requiring knowledge about the
   phenotypic consistency and genetic basis of cooperative behaviour. While
   previous observational studies reported considerably high heritabilities
   of helping behaviour in cooperatively breeding vertebrates, experimental
   studies disentangling the relevant genetic and non-genetic components of
   cooperative behaviour are lacking. In a half-sibling breeding
   experiment, we investigated the repeatability and heritability of three
   major helping behaviours performed by subordinates of the cooperatively
   breeding fish Neolamprologus pulcher. To experimentally manipulate the
   amount of help needed in a territory, we raised the fish in two
   environments differing in egg predation risk. All three helping
   behaviours were significantly repeatable, but had very low
   heritabilities. The high within-individual consistencies were
   predominantly due to maternal and permanent environment effects. The
   perceived egg predation risk had no effect on helping, but social
   interactions significantly influenced helping propensities. Our results
   reveal that developmentally plastic adjustments of provided help to
   social context shape cooperative phenotypes, whereas heritable genetic
   variation plays a minor role.}},

Title = {{Retrieval of higher order statistical moments from full-waveform LiDAR
   data for tree species classification}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{196}},
Pages = {{28-41}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Tree inventories, inter alia, need information on the tree species.
   Previous studies aimed at distinguishing tree species based on three
   dimensional tree structure metrics derived from airborne laser scanning
   (ALS) point clouds or based on features from full-waveform (FW) laser
   scanning data provided by today's sensors. Classifications based on FW
   features mainly use echo amplitude, pulse energy (hereafter referred to
   as energy) and width, which are typically retrieved by waveform
   decomposition, often performed using the symmetric Gaussian distribution
   function.
   However, for forested areas, the symmetry of the echo shape is
   potentially modified by multiple scattering and the distribution of
   scattering elements (e.g. leaves). We assess the potential of processing
   full-waveform ALS data such that the third and fourth statistical
   moments, i.e. the echo skewness and the echo kurtosis, can be retrieved
   in addition to the amplitude, energy and FWHM. We propose a waveform
   decomposition approach using the skew normal distribution (SND)
   function, which enables the modelling of skewed echoes. We investigate
   the difference of tree-crown aggregated SND derived FW features between
   seven tree species (969 individual trees) in a temperate mixed forest
   with the aim of detecting the most descriptive echo features. The such
   derived FW features are tested for species classification.
   The results reveal that the largest differences across the tree species
   are in the mean energy of the first echoes (15 out of 21 species pairs
   show differences), followed by the mean amplitude of the first echoes
   and the mean skewness of all echoes originating from a single crown (14
   out of 21 species pairs show differences against each other for both
   features).
   The differentiation of coniferous and deciduous trees benefits from the
   features derived from the SND decomposition compared to the use of echo
   amplitude only (0.39 vs. 0.61 in Cohen's k). As the classification
   accuracy of the three dominant tree species within the test site only
   shows a small increase (0.20 vs. 0.26 in Cohen's k) by adding FW
   features, we propose the use of such features in combination with
   features from multispectral data for this purpose.
   The SND decomposition is comparable to the Gaussian decomposition
   regarding the decomposition accuracy (RMSE = 4.45 vs. RMSE = 3.50) and
   computational cost. Hence, we propose the default use of the SND
   decomposition, as the SND is a more flexible function, allowing for the
   modelling of normally distributed echoes, as well as the fitting of
   skewed echoes, while no limitations regarding the direction of the
   skewness are introduced. We attribute the difficulties in the tree
   species classification to the relatively wide ranges of the crown
   aggregated features within one species, which for some features results
   in a considerable overlap of the feature ranges across the species. (C)

Abstract = {{Trophy hunting, the selective removal of animals for human recreation,
   can contribute to conservation when appropriately managed. Yet, little
   is known about how harvest rates or different definitions of trophy
   affect age structure and trophy size in harvested animals and in
   survivors because no controlled studies exist. To investigate the
   impacts of different management regimes, we developed an
   individual-based model for bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), based on
   empirical data on survival from a protected population and data on horn
   growth from 2 populations that differed in their growth rates. One
   population showed slow horn growth and the other population fast horn
   growth. We subjected these model populations to varying harvest rates
   and 2 different hunting regulations: 4/5 curl and full-curl definitions
   of a trophy male. We found that the effect of hunting regulations
   depends on horn growth rate. In populations with fast horn growth, the
   effects of trophy hunting on male age structure and horn size were
   greater and the effect of a change in the definition of legal male
   smaller than in populations with slow growth rates. High harvest rates
   led to a younger age structure and smaller horn size. Both effects were
   weakened by a more restrictive definition of trophy male. As harvest
   rates increased past 40\% of legal males, the number of males harvested
   increased only marginally because an increasing proportion of the
   harvested males included those that had just become legal. Although our
   simulation focused on bighorn sheep, the link between horn growth rate
   and harvest effects may be applicable for any size-selective harvest
   regime. (C) 2017 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Fossil fuel subsidies are a key barrier for economic development and
   climate change mitigation. While the plunge in international fuel prices
   has increased the political will to introduce fossil fuel subsidy
   reforms, recently introduced reforms may risk backsliding when fuel
   prices rebound particularly if they fail to address the underlying
   mechanisms that create demand for low fossil fuel prices. Extant
   literature has mostly focused on the consequences of fossil fuel
   subsidies, including their economic or environmental impact, and the
   social contract that make their reform difficult. In this paper, we
   complement the extant literature with a socio-technical perspective of
   fossil fuel subsidies to explore the systemic mechanisms that often keep
   subsidies in place and how these mechanisms can be weakened.
   Specifically, in case studies of the electricity sectors in South Africa
   and Tunisia, we trace the socio-technical foundations of their fossil
   fuel subsidy regimes and the potential of renewable energy policy in
   disrupting this regime We discuss the relevance of our results for
   national policymakers wishing to implement and international actors
   wishing to support fossil fuel subsidy reform. In particular, we
   highlight that the socio-technical perspective of fossil fuel subsidies
   offers new intervention points for subsidy reform and that policy
   designs and assistance should strengthen technologies and actors that
   are most likely to destabilize the fossil fuel subsidy regime.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the ability of two legend designs on a soil-landscape map to
   efficiently and effectively support map reading tasks with the goal of
   better understanding how the design choices affect user performance.
   Developing such knowledge is essential to design effective interfaces
   for digital earth systems. One of the two legends contained an
   alphabetical ordering of categories, while the other used a perceptual
   grouping based on the Munsell color space. We tested the two legends for
   4 tasks with 20 experts (in geography-related domains). We analyzed
   traditional usability metrics and participants' eye movements to
   identify the possible reasons behind their success and failure in the
   experimental tasks. Surprisingly, an overwhelming majority of the
   participants failed to arrive at the correct responses for two of the
   four tasks, irrespective of the legend design. Furthermore,
   participants' prior knowledge of soils and map interpretation abilities
   led to interesting performance differences between the two legend types.
   We discuss how participant background might have played a role in
   performance and why some tasks were particularly hard to solve despite
   participants' relatively high levels of experience in map reading. Based
   on our observations, we caution soil cartographers to be aware of the

Abstract = {{Vegetation composition and water surface area are changing in many
   tundra regions due to climate warming, which is twice as strong in the
   Arctic as compared to the global mean. Such land cover changes feed back
   to climate and permafrost thaw through altering the surface energy
   budget. We quantified the influence of vegetation type, canopy
   characteristics, and patchiness on the tundra shortwave radiation
   components. We used in situ measurements and vegetation mapping to
   parametrise a 3D radiative transfer model (DART) for summer conditions
   at the Kytalyk test site in northeast Siberia. We analysed model results
   assessing the most important drivers of canopy albedo, transmittance,
   and absorptance of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Tundra
   albedo was strongly influenced by the fractional cover of water
   surfaces. Albedo decreased with increasing shrub cover. However, plant
   area index effects on albedo were not statistically significant. Canopy
   transmittance and PAR absorptance (f(ApAR)) were almost entirely
   controlled by plant area index at the landscape scale. Only about one
   half of the total plant area index consisted of green leaves, while wood
   and standing dead leaves contributed equally to the other half. While
   spatial patterns and patch sizes of vegetation types and open water did
   not significantly influence the radiation budget at the landscape scale,
   it contributed to the large variability at the local scale. Such local
   variability of shortwave radiation may impact evapotranspiration and
   primary productivity at a range of scales. Therefore, the variation of
   radiation fluxes within single vegetation types potentially affects
   larger scale energy, water, and carbon fluxes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Information about catchment-scale groundwater dynamics is necessary to
   understand how catchments store and release water and why water quantity
   and quality varies in streams. However, groundwater level monitoring is
   often restricted to a limited number of sites. Knowledge of the factors
   that determine similarity between monitoring sites can be used to
   predict catchment-scale groundwater storage and connectivity of
   different runoff source areas. We used distance-based and
   correlation-based similarity measures to quantify the spatial and
   temporal differences in shallow groundwater similarity for 51 monitoring
   sites in a Swiss prealpine catchment. The 41 months long time series
   were preprocessed using Dynamic Time-Warping and a Flow-corrected Time
   Transformation to account for small timing differences and bias toward
   low-flow periods. The mean distance-based groundwater similarity was
   correlated to topographic indices, such as upslope contributing area,
   topographic wetness index, and local slope. Correlation-based similarity
   was less related to landscape position but instead revealed differences
   between seasons. Analysis of variance and partial Mantel tests showed
   that landscape position, represented by the topographic wetness index,
   explained 52\% of the variability in mean distance-based groundwater
   similarity, while spatial distance, represented by the Euclidean
   distance, explained only 5\%. The variability in distance-based
   similarity and correlation-based similarity between groundwater and
   streamflow time series was significantly larger for midslope locations
   than for other landscape positions. This suggests that groundwater
   dynamics at these midslope sites, which are important to understand
   runoff source areas and hydrological connectivity at the catchment
   scale, are most difficult to predict.}},

Abstract = {{Life history theory is an essential framework to understand the
   evolution of reproductive allocation. It predicts that individuals of
   long-lived species favour their own survival over current reproduction,
   leading individuals to refrain from reproducing under harsh conditions.
   Here we test this prediction in a long-lived bird species, the Siberian
   jay Perisoreus infaustus. Long-term data revealed that females rarely
   refrain from breeding, but lay smaller clutches in unfavourable years.
   Neither offspring body size, female survival nor offspring survival
   until the next year was influenced by annual condition, habitat quality,
   clutch size, female age or female phenotype. Given that many nests
   failed due to nest predation, the variance in the number of fledglings
   was higher than the variance in the number of eggs and female survival.
   An experimental challenge with a novel pathogen before egg laying
   largely replicated these patterns in two consecutive years with
   contrasting conditions. Challenged females refrained from breeding only
   in the unfavourable year, but no downstream effects were found in either
   year. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that
   condition-dependent reproductive allocation may serve to maintain female
   survival and offspring quality, supporting patterns found in long-lived
   mammals. We discuss avenues to develop life history theory concerning
   strategies to offset reproductive costs.}},

Abstract = {{Using principal-agent theory, we explain the effect of an exogenous
   increase in financial resources on the autonomy of international
   bureaucracies. This can be empirically demonstrated at the example of
   the unexpectedly large inflow of fees for the registration of clean
   development mechanism (CDM) projects and issuance of emission credits on
   the political influence of staff in the UNFCCC Secretariat. Through
   document analysis, interviews and econometric analysis, we show that CDM
   staff was able to gain substantial influence over concrete policy
   decisions and even change the structure of relevant decision-making and
   consultation processes. We also show that this may reinforce rather than
   reduce the role of special interests expressed via country
   representatives in the CDM Executive Board. While one might be worried
   about the erosion of democratic principles at the international level,
   from a normative perspective, the overall effect is difficult to assess.

Abstract = {{Spatially discontinuous permafrost conditions frequently occur in the
   European Alps. How soils under such conditions have evolved and how they
   may react to climate warming is largely unknown. This study focuses on
   the comparison of nearby soils that are characterised by the presence or
   absence of permafrost (active-layer thickness: 2-3m) in the alpine
   (tundra) and subalpine (forest) range of the Eastern Swiss Alps using a
   multi-method (geochemical and mineralogical) approach. Moreover, a new
   non-steady-state concept was applied to determine rates of chemical
   weathering, soil erosion, soil formation, soil denudation, and soil
   production. Long-term chemical weathering rates, soil formation and
   erosion rates were assessed by using immobile elements, fine-earth
   stocks and meteoric Be-10. In addition, the weathering index (K+Ca)/Ti,
   the amount of Fe- and Al-oxyhydroxides and clay minerals characteristics
   were considered. All methods indicated that the differences between
   permafrost-affected and non-permafrost-affected soils were small.
   Furthermore, the soils did not uniformly differ in their weathering
   behaviour. A tendency towards less intense weathering in soils that were
   affected by permafrost was noted: at most sites, weathering rates, the
   proportion of oxyhydroxides and the weathering stage of clay minerals
   were lower in permafrost soils. In part, erosion rates were higher at
   the permafrost sites and accounted for 79-97\% of the denudation rates.
   In general, soil formation rates (8.8-86.7t/km(2)/yr) were in the
   expected range for Alpine soils. Independent of permafrost conditions,
   it seems that the local microenvironment (particularly vegetation and
   subsequently soil organic matter) has strongly influenced denudation
   rates. As the climate has varied since the beginning of soil evolution,
   the conditions for soil formation and weathering were not stable over
   time. Soil evolution in high Alpine settings is complex owing to, among
   others, spatio-temporal variations of permafrost conditions and thus
   climate. This makes predictions of future behaviour very difficult.

Title = {{Overestimation of Crop Root Biomass in Field Experiments Due to
   Extraneous Organic Matter}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Root biomass is one of the most relevant root parameters for studies of
   plant response to environmental change, soil carbon modeling or
   estimations of soil carbon sequestration. A major source of error in
   root biomass quantification of agricultural crops in the field is the
   presence of extraneous organic matter in soil: dead roots from previous
   crops, weed roots, incorporated above ground plant residues and organic
   soil amendments, or remnants of soil fauna. Using the isotopic
   difference between recent maize root biomass and predominantly
   C3-derived extraneous organic matter, we determined the proportions of
   maize root biomass carbon of total carbon in root samples from the Swiss
   long-term field trial ``DOK.{''} We additionally evaluated the effects
   of agricultural management (bio-organic and conventional), sampling
   depth (0-0.25, 0.25-0.5, 0.5-0.75 m) and position (within and between
   maize rows), and root size class (coarse and fine roots) as defined by
   sieve mesh size (2 and 0.5 mm) on those proportions, and quantified the
   success rate of manual exclusion of extraneous organic matter from root
   samples. Only 60\% of the root mass that we retrieved from field soil
   cores was actual maize root biomass from the current season. While the
   proportions of maize root biomass carbon were not affected by
   agricultural management, they increased consistently with soil depth,
   were higher within than between maize rows, and were higher in coarse (>
   2 mm) than in fine (<= 2 and > 0.5) root samples. The success rate of
   manual exclusion of extraneous organic matter from root samples was
   related to agricultural management and, at best, about 60\%. We assume
   that the composition of extraneous organic matter is strongly influenced
   by agricultural management and soil depth and governs the effect size of
   the investigated factors. Extraneous organic matter may result in severe
   overestimation of recovered root biomass and has, therefore, large
   implications for soil carbon modeling and estimations of the climate
   change mitigation potential of soils.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{198}},
Pages = {{417-431}},
Month = {{FEB 23}},
Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ethnopharmacological investigations of
   traditional medicines have made significant contributions to
   plant-derived drugs, as well as the advancement of pharmacology. Drug
   discovery from medicinal flora is more complex than generally
   acknowledged because plants are applied for different therapeutic
   indications within and across cultures. Therefore we propose the concept
   of ``reverse ethnopharmacology{''} and compare biomedical uses of plant
   taxa with their ethnomedicinal and popular uses and test the effect of
   these on the probability of finding biomedical and specifically
   anticancer drugs.
   Materials and methods: For this analysis we use data on taxonomy and
   medical indications of plant derived biomedical drugs, clinical trial,
   and preclinical trial drug candidates published by Zhu et al. (2011) and
   compare their therapeutic indications with their ethnomedicinal and
   popular uses as reported in the NAPRALERT{''} database. Specifically, we
   test for increase or decrease of the probability of finding anticancer
   drugs based on ethnomedicinal and popular reports with Bayesian logistic
   regression analyses.
   Results: Anticancer therapy resulted as the most frequent biomedicinal
   indication of the therapeutics derived from the 225 drug producing
   higher plant taxa and showed an association with ethnomedicinal and
   popular uses in women's medicine, which was also the most important
   popular use-category. Popular remedies for dysmenorrhoea, and uses as
   emmenagogues, abortifacients and contraceptives showed a positive effect
   on the probability of finding anticancer drugs. Another positive effect
   on the probability of discovering anticancer therapeutics was estimated
   for popular herbal drugs associated with the therapy of viral and
   bacterial infections, while the highest effect was found for popular
   remedies used to treat cancer symptoms. However, this latter effect
   seems to be influenced by the feedback loop and divulgence of biomedical
   knowledge on the popular level.
   Conclusion: We introduce the concept of reverse ethnopharmacology and
   show that it is possible to estimate the probability of finding
   biomedical drugs based on ethnomedicinal uses. The detected associations
   confirm the classical ethnopharmacological approach where a popular
   remedy for disease category X results in a biomedical drug for disease
   category X but does also point out the existence of cross-over
   relationships where popular remedies for disease category X result in
   biomedical therapeutics for disease category Y (Zhu et al., 2011).}},

Abstract = {{Understanding rock slope kinematics in steep, fractured bedrock
   permafrost is a challenging task. Recent laboratory studies have
   provided enhanced understanding of rock fatigue and fracturing in cold
   environments but were not successfully confirmed by field studies. This
   study presents a unique time series of fracture kinematics, rock
   temperatures and environmental conditions at 3500m a.s.l. on the steep,
   strongly fractured Hornligrat of the Matterhorn (Swiss Alps). Thanks to
   8 years of continuous data, the longer-term evolution of fracture
   kinematics in permafrost can be analyzed with an unprecedented level of
   detail. Evidence for common trends in spatiotemporal pattern of fracture
   kinematics could be found: a partly reversible seasonal movement can be
   observed at all locations, with variable amplitudes. In the wider
   context of rock slope stability assessment, we propose separating
   reversible (elastic) components of fracture kinematics, caused by
   thermoelastic strains, from the irreversible (plastic) component due to
   other processes. A regression analysis between temperature and fracture
   displacement shows that all instrumented fractures exhibit reversible
   displacements that dominate fracture kinematics in winter. Furthermore,
   removing this reversible component from the observed displacement
   enables us to quantify the irreversible component. From this, a new
   metric - termed index of irreversibility - is proposed to quantify
   relative irreversibility of fracture kinematics. This new index can
   identify periods when fracture displacements are dominated by
   irreversible processes. For many sensors, irreversible enhanced fracture
   displacement is observed in summer and its initiation coincides with the
   onset of positive rock temperatures. This likely indicates
   thawing-related processes, such as meltwater percolation into fractures,
   as a forcing mechanism for irreversible displacements. For a few
   instrumented fractures, irreversible displacements were found at the
   onset of the freezing period, suggesting that cryogenic processes act as
   a driving factor through increasing ice pressure. The proposed analysis
   provides a tool for investigating and better understanding processes
   related to irreversible kinematics.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms often harbor latent traits that are byproducts of other
   adaptations. Such latent traits are not themselves adaptive but can
   become adaptive in the right environment. Here I discuss several
   examples of such traits. Their abundance suggests that environmental
   change rather than new mutations might often limit the origin of
   evolutionary adaptations and innovations. This is important, because
   environments can change much faster than new mutations arise. I
   introduce a conceptual model that distinguishes between mutation-limited
   and environment-limited trait origins and suggest how experiments could
   help discriminate between them. Wherever latent traits are plentiful,
   ecology rather than genetics might determine how fast new adaptations
   originate and thus how fast adaptive Darwinian evolution proceeds.}},

Abstract = {{The toilets used most in informal urban settlements have detrimental
   consequences for the environment and human health due to the lack of
   proper collection and treatment of toilet waste. Concepts for safe,
   sustainable and affordable sanitation systems exist, but their
   feasibility and acceptance have to be investigated at an early stage of
   development, which is difficult due to the high costs of building
   working models. In this paper, we present an approach to estimate
   acceptance in a valid and representative form with only one working
   model, and apply it to test an innovative zero-emission toilet with
   recycling of wash water. Four basic principles were specified for
   investigation and nine hypotheses formulated to test the feasibility and
   acceptance of these principles: source separation of urine and feces
   with subsequent collection for resource recovery; provision of wash
   water in a separate cycle with on-site recovery through a membrane
   bioreactor; a convenient and attractive overall design; and a
   financially sustainable business plan. In Kampala (Uganda), in 2013,
   data was collected from 22 regular users, 308 one-time users and a
   representative sample of 1538 participants. Qualitative data was
   collected from the users, who evaluated their likes, perceived benefits,
   social norms and expected ease of use based on verbal and visual
   information. Most of the hypotheses were confirmed, indicating the
   feasibility and acceptance of the basic principles. Source separation
   and on-site water recovery were found to be feasible and accepted,
   provided users can be convinced that the emptying service and water
   recovery process work reliably. In the survey, the toilet was evaluated
   favorably and 51\% of the participants agreed to be placed on a bogus
   waiting list. However, some design challenges were revealed, such as the
   size of the toilet, hiding feces from view and improving the separation
   of urine and water. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Pollinator adaptation and the evolution of floral nectar sugar

Abstract = {{A long-standing debate concerns whether nectar sugar composition evolves
   as an adaptation to pollinator dietary requirements or whether it is
   `phylogenetically constrained'. Here, we use a modelling approach to
   evaluate the hypothesis that nectar sucrose proportion (NSP) is an
   adaptation to pollinators. We analyse similar to 2100 species of
   asterids, spanning several plant families and pollinator groups (PGs),
   and show that the hypothesis of adaptation cannot be rejected: NSP
   evolves towards two optimal values, high NSP for specialist-pollinated
   and low NSP for generalist-pollinated plants. However, the inferred
   adaptive process is weak, suggesting that adaptation to PG only provides
   a partial explanation for how nectar evolves. Additional factors are
   therefore needed to fully explain nectar evolution, and we suggest that
   future studies might incorporate floral shape and size and the abiotic
   environment into the analytical framework. Further, we show that NSP and
   PG evolution are correlated - in a manner dictated by pollinator
   behaviour. This contrasts with the view that a plant necessarily has to
   adapt its nectar composition to ensure pollination but rather suggests
   that pollinators adapt their foraging behaviour or dietary requirements
   to the nectar sugar composition presented by the plants. Finally, we
   document unexpectedly sucrose-poor nectar in some specialized
   nectarivorous bird-pollinated plants from the Old World, which might
   represent an overlooked form of pollinator deception. Thus, our broad
   study provides several new insights into how nectar evolves and we
   conclude by discussing why maintaining the conceptual dichotomy between
   adaptation and constraint might be unhelpful for advancing this field.}},

Abstract = {{C-4 photosynthesis allows highly efficient carbon fixation that
   originates from tightly regulated anatomical and biochemical
   modifications of leaf architecture. Recent studies showed that leaf
   transcriptome modifications during leaf ontogeny of closely related C-3
   (Tarenaya hassleriana) and C-4 (Gynandropsis gynandra) species within
   the Cleomaceae family existed but they did not identify any dedicated
   transcriptional networks or factors specifically driving C-4 leaf
   ontogeny. RNAseq analysis provides a steady-state quantification of
   whole-cell mRNAs but does not allow any discrimination between
   transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes that may occur
   simultaneously during leaf ontogeny. Here we use exon-intron split
   analysis (EISA) to determine the extent to which transcriptional and
   post-transcriptional processes are involved in the regulation of gene
   expression between young and expanded leaves in both species.
   C-4-specific changes in post-transcriptional regulation were observed
   for genes involved in the Calvin-Benson cycle and some photosystem
   components but not for C-4 core-cycle genes. Overall, this study
   provides an unbiased genome-wide insight into the post-transcriptional
   mechanisms that regulate gene expression through the control of mRNA
   levels and could be central to the onset of C-4 photosynthesis. This
   mechanism is cytosolic which implies cell-specific modifications of mRNA
   stability. Understanding this mechanism may be crucial when aiming to
   transform C-3 crops into C-4 crops.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{This work provides a summary of the typical floral structure of subtribe
   Hyptidinae (Lamiaceae), in which both style and stamens are declinate
   within or near the concave anterior corolla lobe. Cross-pollination is
   facilitated by protandry, acting in conjunction with the explosive
   release of the stamens and pollen. In contrast, we report that in the
   three species of the genus Eplingiella we found individuals with either
   resupinate or non-resupinate flowers, which represents a novel floral
   dimorphism. In these species of Eplingiella, the style occupies a
   position towards the posterior corolla lip and opposes the declinate
   stamens. Thus, in non-resupinate flowers the pollinating bee receives
   pollen on its ventral side and makes contact with the style on its
   dorsal side, whereas in resupinate flowers, the bee receives pollen on
   its dorsal side, and contacts the style on its ventral side. Both floral
   morphs seem to be required to achieve cross-pollination. In the two
   populations studied, each of the two morphs is present and in similar
   proportions, providing a novel means of promoting cross-pollination and
   reducing selfing. The situation in Eplingiella is compared to some other
   examples of floral polymorphism, but appears to be a unique pollination
   strategy, here termed Resupinate Dimorphy.}},

Pages = {{231-240}},
Abstract = {{Twitter is a well-known microblogging platform for rapid diffusion of
   views, ideas, and information. During disasters, it has widely been used
   to communicate evacuation plans, distribute calls for help, and assist
   in damage assessment. The reliability of such information is very
   important for decision-making in a crisis situation, but also difficult
   to assess. There is little research so far on the transferability of
   quality assessment methods from one geographic region to another. The
   main contribution of this research is to study Twitter usage
   characteristics of users based in different geographic locations during
   disasters. We examine tweeting activity during two earthquakes in Italy
   and Myanmar. We compare the granularity of geographic references used,
   user profile characteristics that are related to credibility, and the
   performance of Naive Bayes models for classifying Tweets when used on
   data from a different region than the one used to train the model. Our
   results show similar geographic granularity for Myanmar and Italy
   earthquake events, but the Myanmar earthquake event has less information
   from locations nearby when compared to Italy. Additionally, there are
   significant and complex differences in user and usage characteristics,
   but a high performance for the Naive Bayes classifier even when applied
   to data from a different geographic region. This research provides a
   basis for further research in credibility assessment of users reporting
   about disasters}},

Abstract = {{Bergmann's rule predicts increasing body sizes at higher elevations. The
   elevational Rapoport's rule predicts an increase of elevational range
   size with higher elevations. Both rules have often been related to
   effects of temperature. Larger bodies allow more efficient heat
   preservation at lower temperature, explaining Bergmann's rule. Higher
   temperature variability may select for adaptations that allow increased
   range sizes, explaining Rapoport's rule. The generality of both rules
   has been challenged and evidence towards explanatory mechanisms has been
   equivocal. We investigated temperature and its variability as
   explanations for Bergmann's and Rapoport's rule in moths along an
   elevation gradient in Switzerland. In particular, we tested for
   relationships between elevation, temperature and body size across almost
   300 species of Macrolepidoptera along a gradient from 600 to 2400 m
   a.s.l. The gradient was resampled throughout the vegetation season,
   which allowed assessing temperature effects independently from
   elevation. We controlled analyses for covariate traits of moths and
   their phylogeny. We found a positive relationship between body size and
   elevation, but no link with temperature. Furthermore, there was no
   positive link between average elevation and elevational range, but there
   was between temperature variability and elevational range. We conclude
   that mechanisms other than temperature can lead to increasing body sizes
   with elevation (supporting Bergmann's pattern, but not the mechanism).
   Contrary to that, data support the mechanism for Rapoport's rule: high
   temperature variability is associated with large ranges. However,
   because temperature variability is not necessarily increasing with
   elevation, it may not always lead to the geographic pattern predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Only scarce information is available on how organic C is incorporated
   into the soil during the decay and how (micro) climate influences this
   process. Therefore, we investigated the effect of exposure and elevation
   on the organic litter decomposition and C-stabilisation in acidic soils
   of an Alpine environment. An experiment with artificially C-13 labelled
   Norway spruce needles was carried out at north- and south-exposed sites
   between 1200 and 2400 m a.s.l. in the Italian Alps using mesocosms.
   After 1 year, the C-13 recoveries of the bulk soil were 18.6\% at the
   north-facing slopes and 31.5\% at the south-facing slopes. A density
   fractionation into a light (LF; ae<currency>1.6 g cm(-3)) and a heavy
   fraction (HF; > 1.6 g cm(-3)) of the soil helped to identify how the
   applied substrate was stabilised. At the northern slope, 10.5\% of the
   substrate was recovered in the LF and 8.1\% in the HF and at the
   south-facing slope 22.8\% in the LF and 8.1\% in the HF. The overall
   C-13 recovery was higher at the south-facing sites due to restricted
   water availability. Although the climate is humid in the whole area,
   soil moisture availability becomes more important at south-facing sites
   due to higher evapotranspiration. However, at sites > 1700 m a.s.l, the
   situation changed, as the northern slope had higher recovery rates. At
   such altitudes, temperature effects are more dominant. This highlights
   the importance of locally strongly varying edaphic factors when
   investigating the carbon cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Until 2007 only a handful of surface finds dating to between the end of
   the LGM and the Middle Neolithic were known in the alpine regions of
   central and south-eastern Switzerland. A number of recent rescue
   excavations, research projects and single finds have now shown the
   presence of people at high altitude in these parts of the Alps from the
   9th millennium cal BC onwards. Both open-air sites and rock shelters are
   represented. Many sites lie above the valley floor, in the upper
   subalpine or alpine zones, and on routes to minor as well as major
   passes. Together with new palaeoenvironmental data, these archaeological
   finds allow us first insights into the nature of interaction of
   Mesolithic people in the south-eastern Swiss Alps with their social and
   natural environment, as well as their relationship with regions further
   afield. Furthermore, the finds allow us to start thinking about future
   research into the early prehistory of the south-eastern Swiss Alps. (C)

Abstract = {{Permafrost is a widespread phenomenon in mountainous regions of the
   world such as the European Alps. Many important topics such as the
   future evolution of permafrost related to climate change and the
   detection of permafrost related to potential natural hazards sites are
   of major concern to our society. Numerical permafrost models are the
   only tools which allow for the projection of the future evolution of
   permafrost. Due to the complexity of the processes involved and the
   heterogeneity of Alpine terrain, models must be carefully calibrated,
   and results should be compared with observations at the site (borehole)
   scale. However, for large-scale applications, a site-specific model
   calibration for a multitude of grid points would be very time-consuming.
   To tackle this issue, this study presents a semiautomated calibration
   method using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) as
   implemented in a 1-D soil model (CoupModel) and applies it to six
   permafrost sites in the Swiss Alps. We show that this semiautomated
   calibration method is able to accurately reproduce the main thermal
   condition characteristics with some limitations at sites with unique
   conditions such as 3-D air or water circulation, which have to be
   calibrated manually. The calibration obtained was used for global and
   regional climate model (GCM/RCM)-based long-term climate projections
   under the A1B climate scenario (EU-ENSEMBLES project) specifically
   downscaled at each borehole site. The projection shows general
   permafrost degradation with thawing at 10 m, even partially reaching 20m
   depth by the end of the century, but with different timing among the
   sites and with partly considerable uncertainties due to the spread of
   the applied climatic forcing.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland and estuary restoration presents a number of complex challenges
   that are primarily social, cultural, economic, and governance-related
   rather than ecological. Here we consider the case of wetland restoration
   in the Po Delta, Italy. Wetland restoration of the Po Delta is a goal of
   a broad range of actors in the region and this project is a response to
   local calls for action. We investigate why local stakeholders are
   unsatisfied with apparently successful restoration projects, and
   appraise the factors that favor both the fulfillment of environmental
   targets and establishment of cooperative relations. We suggest that
   historical legacies of land use in the Po Delta have influenced current
   governance practices in a complex and fragmented governance context.
   Also, patterns of wetland restoration and wetland management practices
   differ between wetland types, and their outcomes may be influenced by
   the number of stakeholders involved, funding, and ability to generate
   direct revenues from management. However, there seem to be no blueprint
   solutions to successful wetland management and wetland restoration, and
   results are uneven at the landscape scale and often depending on
   contingencies. Maintaining traditional practices that retain cultural
   importance may be seen as part of restoration by local people. As a
   landscape that is highly anthropogenic and in continuous motion, we
   argue that the Delta exemplifies some of the challenges that restoration
   will face in a world increasingly characterized by novel ecosystems. We
   suggest actions that could contribute to enhancing wetland restoration
   outcomes in the Po Delta.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological changes following changes in species' distribution and
   phenology have been suggested to be the third universal response to
   global environmental change. Although structural size and body mass
   result from different genetic, physiological, and ecological mechanisms,
   they are used interchangeably in studies evaluating population responses
   to environmental change. Using a 22-year ( 1991-2013) dataset including
   1768 individuals, we investigated the coupled dynamics of size and mass
   in a hibernating mammal, the Alpine marmot ( Marmota marmota), in
   response to local environmental conditions. We ( i) quantified temporal
   trends in both traits, ( ii) determined the environmental drivers of
   trait dynamics, and ( iii) identified the life-history processes
   underlying the observed changes. Both phenotypic traits were followed
   through life: we focused on the initial trait value ( juvenile size and
   mass) and later-life development ( annual change in size {[} Delta size]
   and mass {[} Delta mass]). First, we demonstrated contrasting dynamics
   between size and mass over the study period. Juvenile size and
   subsequent Dsize showed significant declines, whereas juvenile mass and
   subsequent Dmass remained constant. As a consequence of smaller size
   associated with a similar mass, individuals were in better condition in
   recent years. Second, size and mass showed different sensitivities to
   environmental variables. Both traits benefited from early access to
   resources in spring, whereas Dmass, particularly in early life, also
   responded to summer and winter conditions. Third, the interannual
   variation in both traits was caused by changes in early life
   development. Our study supports the importance of considering the
   differences between size and mass responses to the environment when
   evaluating the mechanisms underlying population dynamics. The current
   practice of focusing on only one trait in population modeling can lead
   to misleading conclusions when evaluating species' resilience to
   contemporary climate change.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate the accuracy of a machine-learning algorithm that uses LiDAR
   data to optimize ground-based sensor placements for catchment-scale snow
   measurements. Sampling locations that best represent catchment
   physiographic variables are identified with the Expectation Maximization
   algorithm for a Gaussian mixture model. A Gaussian process is then used
   to model the snow depth in a 1 km(2) area surrounding the network, and
   additional sensors are placed to minimize the model uncertainty. The aim
   of the study is to determine the distribution of sensors that minimizes
   the bias and RMSE of the model. We compare the accuracy of the
   snow-depth model using the proposed placements to an existing sensor
   network at the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory. Each model is
   validated with a 1 m(2) LiDAR-derived snow-depth raster from 14 March
   2010. The proposed algorithm exhibits higher accuracy with fewer sensors
   (8 sensors, RMSE 38.3 cm, bias=3.49 cm) than the existing network (23
   sensors, RMSE 53.0 cm, bias=15.5 cm) and randomized placements (8
   sensors, RMSE 63.7 cm, bias=24.7 cm). We then evaluate the spatial and
   temporal transferability of the method using 14 LiDAR scenes from two
   catchments within the JPL Airborne Snow Observatory. In each region, the
   optimized sensor placements are determined using the first available
   snow raster for the year. The accuracy in the remaining LiDAR surveys is
   then compared to 100 configurations of sensors selected at random. We
   find the error statistics (bias and RMSE) to be more consistent across
   the additional surveys than the average random configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Since the end of the Little Ice Age around 1850, glaciers in Europe have
   strongly retreated. Thanks to early topographic surveys in Switzerland,
   accurate maps are available, which enable us to trace glacier changes
   back in time. The earliest map for all of Switzerland that is usable for
   a detailed analysis is the Dufour map from around 1850 with subsequent
   topographic maps on a similar to 20 year interval. Despite the large
   public and scientific interest in glacier changes through time, this
   historic dataset has not yet been fully utilized for topographic change
   assessment or visualization of historic glacier extents. In this study,
   we use eleven historical topographic maps and more recent digital
   datasets for the region of Zermatt to analyze geometric changes (length,
   area and volume) of Findelengletscher as well as for creating animations
   of glacier evolution through time for use in public communication. All
   maps were georeferenced, the contour lines digitized, and digital
   elevation models (DEMs) created and co-registered. Additional digital
   data like the SRTM X-band DEM and high resolution laser scanning data
   were used to extend the analysis until 2010. Moreover, one independent
   DEM from aerial photogrammetry was used for comparison. During the
   period 1859-2010, Findelengletscher lost 3.5 km of its length (6.9 km in
   2010), 4.42 +/- 0.13 km(2) of its area (15.05 +/- 0.45 km(2) in 2010)
   and 132 +/- 0.52 km(3) of its volume. The average rate of thidaiess loss
   is 0.45 +/- 0.042 m yr(-1) for the 151 years period. Four periods with
   high thickness change from -0.56 m +/- 0.28 yr(-1) (1859-1881), 0.40 +/-
   0.08 m yr(-1) (1937-1965), 0.90 +/- 0.31 m yr(-1) (1995-2000) and -1.18
   +/- 0.02 m yr(-1) (2000-2005) have been identified. Small positive
   thickness changes were found for the periods 1890-1909 (+0.09 +/- 0.46 m
   yr(-1)) and 1988-1995 ( +0.05 +/- 024 m yr(-1)). During its retreat with
   intermittent periods of advance, the glacier separated into three parts.
   The above changes are demonstrated through an animation (available from
   the supplementary material), which has been created to inform the
   general public. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Two early Holocene rock avalanches in the Bernese Alps (Rinderhorn,

Volume = {{268}},

Abstract = {{Large rock avalanches constitute a critical process modulating the
   evolution of alpine landscapes; however, the relatively infrequent
   occurrence of these high-magnitude events makes identifying underlying
   process controls challenging. Here we describe two rock avalanches in
   the Rinderhorn area of the Bernese Alps, Switzerland, providing new
   mapping of rock avalanche source areas and deposits, refined volume
   estimates for each event, runout modeling back-analyses, and absolute
   age constraint from cosmogenic Cl-36 surface exposure dating. Results
   reveal that the Daubensee rock avalanche released similar to 4 million
   m(3) of limestone sliding from the western crest of the Rinderhorn.
   Debris ran out across a Lateglacial moraine before reaching the valley
   bottom and spreading, leaving thin (on average 7 m) deposits across a
   broad area. The runout resulted in a Fahrboschung angle of 21 degrees.
   Part of the deposit now lies beneath Lake Daubensee. The Klein
   Rinderhorn rock avalanche released similar to 37 million m(3) of
   limestone along a dip-slope sliding plane, with a maximum runout
   distance of 4.3 km and estimated Fahrboschung angle of 14 degrees.
   Deposits bulked to similar to 47 million m(3) running up the opposing
   slope, with distinct hummocky morphology in the proximal area and a
   distal longitudinal flow ridge. These deposits were later modified and
   partly obscured by ice avalanches from the nearby Altels peak.
   Cosmogenic Cl-36 surface exposure dating revealed nearly coincident ages
   for both rock avalanches of 9.8 +/- 0.51 a. The large lag time between
   local deglaciation and failure suggests that the events were not
   directly triggered by deglaciation. Rather, the concurrent exposure
   ages, also coinciding with the nearby Kander valley rock avalanche as
   well as paleoseismic records from nearby lakes, strongly suggest seismic
   triggering. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Coping with Migration-Induced Urban Growth: Addressing the Blind Spot of
   UN Habitat}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The demography of cities in the 21st century will be shaped, to a large
   extent, by migration. This paper argues that the rights-based approach
   to urban policy advocated in the preparatory work of Habitat III, the UN
   Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development to be held in
   October 2016 in Quito, Ecuador, may not be conducive to this goal. The
   approach lacks a contextual and dynamic understanding of urbanization.
   It implicitly assumes that a growing and expansive urban economy would
   primarily benefit the rich and harm the poor. The resulting containment
   policies to stop ``urban sprawl{''} and defend ``the right to the
   city{''} can, however, be counterproductive if adopted in cities in less
   developed countries (LDCs) that grow fast due to internal migration.
   Attempts to limit urban growth may merely lead to more informal
   settlements, less affordable housing, and increasing costs of doing
   business. In other words, it may benefit the rich and harm the poor.
   LDCs should, therefore, refrain from adopting defensive urban policies
   mostly advocated by more developed countries (MDCs) and, instead, plan
   for sustainable urban expansion designed to improve access to essential
   urban services and to create a level playing field for newcomers in
   business. In this context, urban policies may build upon the basic
   insights of the late urbanist Jane Jacobs. She recognized that the vital
   function of cities is to provide affordable infrastructure and an
   institutional environment that enable migrants and other marginal urban
   communities to contribute to urban prosperity and problem-solving with
   their skills, networks, and entrepreneurial minds. The resulting social
   and economic empowerment increases access to essential human rights and
   ensures that cities become more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{Steep vegetation-free talus slopes in high mountain environments are
   prone to superficial slope failures and surface erosion. Eco-engineering
   measures can reduce slope instabilities and thus contribute to risk
   mitigation. In a field experiment, we established mycorrhizal and
   nonmycorrhizal research plots and determined their biophysical
   contribution to small-scale soil fixation. Mycorrhizal inoculation
   impact on plant survival, aggregate stability, and fine root development
   was analyzed. Here we present plant survival (n(total) = 1248) and soil
   core (n(total) = 108) analyses of three consecutive years in the Swiss
   Alps. Soil cores were assayed for their aggregate stability coefficient
   (ASC), root length density (RLD), and mean root diameter (MRD).
   Inoculation improved plant survival significantly, but it delayed
   aggregate stabilization relative to the noninoculated site. Higher
   aggregate stability occurred only after three growing seasons. Then also
   RLD tended to be higher and MRD increased significantly at the
   mycorrhizal treated site. There was a positive correlation between RLD,
   ASC, and roots < 0.5 mm, which had the strongest impact on soil
   aggregation. Our results revealed a temporal offset between inoculation
   effects tested in laboratory and field experiments. Consequently, we
   recommend to establish an intermediate to long-term field experimental
   monitoring before transferring laboratory results to the field.}},

Abstract = {{Israel and its vicinity constitute a center of diversity of domesticated
   wheat species (Triticum aestivum and T. durum) and their sympatrically
   growing wild relatives, including wild emmer wheat (T. dicoccoides). We
   investigated differentiation within the forma specialis of their
   obligate powdery mildew pathogen, Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici. A
   total of 61 B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates were collected from the
   three host species in four geographic regions of Israel. Genetic
   relatedness of the isolates was characterized using both virulence
   patterns on 38 wheat lines (including 21 resistance gene differentials)
   and presumptively neutral molecular markers (simple-sequence repeats and
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms). All isolates were virulent on at least
   some genotypes of all three wheat species tested. All assays divided the
   B. graminis f. sp. tritici collection into two distinct groups, those
   from domesticated hosts and those from wild emmer wheat. One-way
   migration was detected from the domestic wheat B. graminis f. sp.
   tritici population to the wild emmer B. graminis f. sp. tritici
   population at a rate of five to six migrants per generation. This gene
   flow may help explain the overlap between the distinct domestic and wild
   B. graminis f. sp. tritici groups. Overall, B. graminis f. sp. tritici
   is significantly differentiated into wild-emmer and domesticated-wheat
   populations, although the results do not support the existence of a
   separate f. sp. dicocci.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid dynamic changes of ocean-terminating outlet glaciers of the
   Greenland ice sheet are related to atmospheric and oceanic warming but
   the detailed link to external forcing is not well understood.
   Observations show high variability in dynamic changes and are mainly
   limited to the past three decades with dense satellite observations.
   Here we compile a long-term record of dynamic changes of Eqip Sermia
   Glacier, West Greenland. Starting in 1912, we combine historical
   measurements of terminus positions, ice-surface elevation and flow
   velocity together with more recent in-situ and remote-sensing
   observations. In the 20th century, the glacier underwent small
   variations in terminus position and flow speed. Between 2000 and 2003,
   the terminus retreated substantially, but stabilized thereafter. In
   2009, the northern terminus lobe started to retreat very rapidly; the
   southern lobe collapsed in 2013. The present terminus position, which
   has retreated by 4 km since 1920, is unprecedented in the historical
   record. Flow velocities were relatively stable until 2010. The recent
   acceleration reached threefold velocities in 2014 and rapidly affected
   the whole terminus region up to 15 km inland. Comparison with forcings
   from the atmosphere and the ocean over the past century shows that no
   dominant cause can be identified, and that local effects of bed geometry
   modulate the glacier response.}},

Abstract = {{Although typical anatomical features of the digestive tract of
   carnivores are well known, such as the presence or absence of a caecum
   in various carnivore taxa, and although a large number of length
   measurements have been published, the body mass measurement of the
   corresponding specimens has mostly not been reported. Here, we add
   original mass and intestine length measurements for 36 carnivore species
   to literature data. Using Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares, we
   demonstrate that marine Carnivora (pinnipeds and the sea otter Enhydra
   lutris) have significantly longer total and small intestines relative to
   body mass than terrestrial Carnivora, and both pinnipeds and mustelids
   in general have particularly long total intestines amongst terrestrial
   Carnivora. The natural diet explains little about variation in relative
   intestinal length measures. However, amongst species that do have a
   caecum, a higher proportion of plant material in the diet might be
   associated with a longer caecum. In particular, a diet with higher
   proportions of plant material provided by humans could have led to a
   particularly long caecum in the domestic dog.}},

Abstract = {{Females of many species mate with multiple males (polyandry), resulting
   in male-male competition extending to post-copulation (sperm
   competition). Males adapt to such post-copulatory sexual selection by
   altering features of their ejaculate that increase its competitiveness
   and/or by decreasing the risk of sperm competition through female
   manipulation or interference with rival male behaviour. At ejaculation,
   males of many species deposit copulatory plugs, which are commonly
   interpreted as a male adaptation to post-copulatory competition and are
   thought to reduce or delay female remating. Here, we used a vertebrate
   model species, the house mouse, to study the consequences of copulatory
   plugs for post-copulatory competition. We experimentally manipulated
   plugs after a female's first mating and investigated the consequences
   for rival male behaviour and paternity outcome. We found that even
   intact copulatory plugs were ineffective at preventing female remating,
   but that plugs influenced the rival male copulatory behaviour. Rivals
   facing intact copulatory plugs performed more but shorter copulations
   and ejaculated later than when the plug had been fully or partially
   removed. This suggests that the copulatory plug represents a
   considerable physical barrier to rival males. The paternity share of
   first males increased with a longer delay between the first and second
   males' ejaculations, indicative of fitness consequences of copulatory
   plugs. However, when males provided little copulatory stimulation, the
   incidence of pregnancy failure increased, representing a potential
   benefit of intense and repeated copulation besides plug removal. We
   discuss the potential mechanisms of how plugs influence sperm
   competition outcome and consequences for male copulatory behaviour.}},

Volume = {{181}},

Abstract = {{Despite concerns about climate change effects on ecosystems functioning,
   little is known on how plant assimilate partitioning changes with
   temperature. Particularly, large temperature effects might occur in cold
   ecosystems where critical processes are at their temperature limit. In
   this study, we tested temperature effects on carbon (C) assimilate
   partitioning in a field experiment at the alpine treeline. We warmed and
   cooled soils of microcosms planted with Pinus mugo or Leucanthemopsis
   alpina, achieving daily mean soil temperatures (3-10 cm depth) around
   5.8, 12.7 and 19.2 degrees C in cooled, control and warmed soils. We
   pulse-labelled these systems with (CO2)-C-14 for one photoperiod and
   traced C-14 over the successive 4 days. Plant net C-14 uptake increased
   steadily with soil temperature. However, C-14 amounts in fungal hyphae,
   soil microbial biomass, soil organic matter, and soil respiration showed
   a non-linear response to temperature. This non-linear pattern was
   particularly pronounced in P. mugo, with five times higher C-14
   activities in cooled compared to control soils, but no difference
   between warmed and control soil. Autoradiographic analysis of the
   spatial distribution of C-14 in soils indicated that temperature effects
   on the vertical label distribution within soils depended on plant
   species. Our results show that plant growth, in particular root
   metabolism, is limited by low soil temperature. As a consequence,
   positive temperature effects on net C uptake may not be paralleled by
   similar changes in rhizodeposition. This has important implications for
   predictions of soil C storage, because rhizodeposits and plant biomass
   vary strongly in their residence times.}},

Title = {{Albian angiosperm pollen from shallow marine strata in the Lusitanian
   Basin, Portugal}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{228}},
Pages = {{67-92}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of angiosperms significantly changed the composition of
   the terrestrial vegetation during the mid-Cretaceous. In contrast to the
   wealth of information available on the biology and systematic
   relationships of early angiosperms, the temporal patterns of their
   evolution and radiation are poorly constrained. Here we present a
   continuous angiosperm pollen record from well-dated shallow marine
   deposits in the Lusitanian Basin, Portugal. The Sao Juliao section
   provides a solid stratigraphic framework to track angiosperm pollen
   distribution patterns from the early Albian to early Cenomanian at
   mid-latitudes. In comparison to previous angiosperm pollen records from
   the Lusitanian basin, the section shows an extended late Albian
   succession and provides new insights into the diversification of early
   angiosperms during this important interval. Productive palynological
   samples were analysed and 79 different angiosperm pollen types have been
   recorded. Throughout the Albian angiosperm pollen represent only a minor
   component of the total palynoflora. The early Albian pollen record is
   characterized by highly diverse assemblages of monoaperturate pollen of
   monocot or ``magnoliid{''} affinity and by the first appearance of
   polyporate and tricolpate pollen of eudicot affinity. A distinct
   diversification phase among tri- and poly-aperturate pollen (e.g.,
   Cretacaeiporites, Retitrescolpites, Rousea, Striatopollis and
   Tricolpites) and the presence of conspicuous pollen grains assigned to
   Dichastopollenites characterize the middle and late Albian palynological
   assemblages. Thus, the section records a striking sequence of
   appearances of important angiosperm pollen morphologies. Monocolpates,
   polyporates and tricolpates appear in the early Albian whereas
   tricolporates appear from the early part of the late Albian onwards.
   Furthermore, well-constrained biostratigraphic ranges of selected
   angiosperm pollen from mid-latitudes are presented. In view of these new
   data, the temporal framework of the palynological Subzones II-B and II-C
   in the Potomac Group succession from the Atlantic Coastal Plain, eastern
   USA is revised to a middle to late Albian age. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Premise of research.The Cenozoic fossil record is crucial for
   understanding the evolution of the remarkably high diversity of
   angiosperms. However, the quality and biases of the angiosperm fossil
   record remain unclear mainly due to the lack of a global
   database.Methodology.We introduce a new global occurrence-based database
   for Cenozoic angiosperm macrofossils, the Cenozoic Angiosperm Database.
   We test the temporal, spatial, and phylogenetic biases of the Cenozoic
   angiosperm macrofossil record and explore their causes.Pivotal
   results.The data presented here include 2478 assemblages from all
   Cenozoic epochs and 1961 sites from all continents, as well as
   representatives of 221 families (of 445 recognized) and 1859 genera, and
   show that the Cenozoic angiosperm macrofossil record is extraordinarily
   rich. However, this rich record is temporally, spatially, and
   phylogenetically biased: the Miocene is much better sampled than the
   rest of Cenozoic, the Northern Hemisphere is better sampled than the
   Southern Hemisphere, and the rosids are better sampled than the rest of
   the angiosperms. The sampling bias might be caused by collecting effort,
   geological history, or diverse features of the families, such as growth
   form and distribution.Conclusions.The Cenozoic macrofossil record of
   angiosperms is remarkably rich, especially of woody families found in
   the Northern Hemisphere. Even if there are numerous biases in these
   data, a judicious use of the database should be highly informative.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we first develop a hypothesis that existing quantitative
   visual complexity measures will overall reflect the level of
   cartographic generalization, and test this hypothesis. Specifically, to
   test our hypothesis, we first selected common geovisualization types
   (i.e., cartographic maps, hybrid maps, satellite images and shaded
   relief maps) and retrieved examples as provided by Google Maps,
   OpenStreetMap and SchweizMobil by swisstopo. Selected geovisualizations
   vary in cartographic design choices, scene contents and different levels
   of generalization. Following this, we applied one of Rosenholtz et al.'s
   (2007) visual clutter algorithms to obtain quantitative visual
   complexity scores for screenshots of the selected maps. We hypothesized
   that visual complexity should be constant across generalization levels,
   however, the algorithm suggested that the complexity of small-scale
   displays (less detailed) is higher than those of large-scale (high
   detail). We also observed vast differences in visual complexity among
   maps providers, which we attribute to their varying approaches towards
   the cartographic design and generalization process. Our efforts will
   contribute towards creating recommendations as to how the visual
   complexity algorithms could be optimized for cartographic products, and
   eventually be utilized as a part of the cartographic design process to
   assess the visual complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Whether and when should we show data in 3D is an on-going debate in
   communities conducting visualization research. A strong opposition
   exists in the information visualization (Infovis) community, and
   seemingly unnecessary/unwarranted use of 3D, e.g., in plots, bar or pie
   charts, is heavily criticized. The scientific visualization (Scivis)
   community, on the other hand, is more supportive of the use of 3D as it
   allows `seeing' invisible phenomena, or designing and printing things
   that are used in e.g., surgeries, educational settings etc. Geographic
   visualization (Geovis) stands between the Infovis and Scivis
   communities. In geographic information science, most visuo-spatial
   analyses have been sufficiently conducted in 2D or 2.5D, including
   analyses related to terrain and much of the urban phenomena. On the
   other hand, there has always been a strong interest in 3D, with similar
   motivations as in Scivis community. Among many types of 3D
   visualizations, a popular one that is exploited both for visual analysis
   and visualization is the highly realistic (geo) virtual environments.
   Such environments may be engaging and memorable for the viewers because
   they offer highly immersive experiences. However, it is not yet
   well-established if we should opt to show the data in 3D; and if yes, a)
   what type of 3D we should use, b) for what task types, and c) for whom.
   In this paper, we identify some of the central arguments for and against
   the use of 3D visualizations around these three considerations in a
   concise interdisciplinary literature review.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative behaviors are promoted by kin selection if the costs to the
   actor are smaller than the fitness benefits to the recipient, weighted
   by the coefficient of relatedness. In primates, cooperation occurs
   primarily among female dyads. Due to male dispersal before sexual
   maturity in many primate species, however, it is unknown whether there
   are sufficient opportunities for selective tolerance and occasional
   coalitionary support for kin selection to favor male nepotistic support.
   We studied the effect of the presence of male kin on correlates of male
   reproductive success (residence time, duration of high dominance rank)
   in non-natal male long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis). We found
   that ``related{''} (i.e., related at the half-sibling level or higher)
   males in a group have a significantly higher probability to remain in
   the non-natal group compared to males without relatives. Moreover, males
   stayed longer in a group when a relative was present at group entry or
   joined the same group within 3 months upon arrival. Males with
   co-residing relatives also maintained a high rank for longer than those
   without. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a
   potential nepotistic effect on residence and rank maintenance among
   non-natal males in a social system without long-term alliances.}},

Abstract = {{The use of virtual environments (VE) for navigation-related studies,
   such as spatial cognition and path retrieval has been widely adopted in
   cognitive psychology and related fields. What motivates the use of VEs
   for such studies is that, as opposed to real-world, we can control for
   the confounding variables in simulated VEs. When simulating a geographic
   environment as a virtual world with the intention to train navigational
   memory in humans, an effective and efficient visual design is important
   to facilitate the amount of recall. However, it is not yet clear what
   amount of information should be included in such visual designs intended
   to facilitate remembering: there can be too little or too much of it.
   Besides the amount of information or level of detail, the types of
   visual features ('elements' in a visual scene) that should be included
   in the representations to create memorable scenes and paths must be
   defined. We analyzed the literature in cognitive psychology,
   geovisualization and information visualization, and identified the key
   factors for studying and evaluating geovisualization designs for their
   function to support and strengthen human navigational memory. The key
   factors we identified are: i) the individual abilities and age of the
   users, ii) the level of realism (LOR) included in the representations
   and iii) the context in which the navigation is performed, thus specific
   tasks within a case scenario. Here we present a concise literature
   review and our conceptual development for follow-up experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter outlines the scope of the ongoing Ceratodon purpureus
   genome project and provides an overview of the C. purpureus
   transcriptome, the evolution of the C. purpureus UV sex chromosomes, and
   the patterns of polymorphism in the species. Comparative analyses of the
   transcriptomes of a male and a female isolate showed that C. purpureus
   and the moss model Physcomitrella patens had highly overlapping gene
   sets, and that most of the genes shared between these two species evolve
   under strong purifying selection. However, the differences between the
   C. purpureus and P. patens genomes refined our understanding of the
   timing of gene family gain and loss across the land plants and the
   heterogeneity in rate of molecular evolution across the genome of these
   two species. Ceratodon purpureus showed a slightly greater codon usage
   bias compared to P. patens, which may be explained by the contrasting
   mating system of the two species. The C. purpureus transcriptomes also
   showed evidence of a genome doubling event similar to 65-76 MYA that was
   independent of the contemporaneous polyploidy event inferred for P.
   patens. These data also suggested considerable physiological and
   developmental divergence between the two species. Genetic mapping and
   molecular evolutionary analysis showed that the nonrecombining UV
   chromosomes of C. purpureus are actively capturing new genes,
   illustrating that at least this part of the genome is highly dynamic.
   Moreover, patterns of polymorphism were highly variable across the
   genome, suggesting that sexual recombination in other parts of the
   genome decouples even genes on the same chromosome, and they experience
   different patterns of natural selection. The forthcoming C. purpureus
   genome will build on these existing resources and enable us to answer
   definitively many questions regarding the evolution of land plant gene
   families, genome structure, and the genetic basis of adaptive variation.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD)
   projects are being designed and implemented across tropical countries,
   intending to curb the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas
   emissions. An important aspect of REDD implementation is the baseline
   against which reductions are measured. The baseline estimates the
   business-as-usual emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.
   We solve a dynamic model of land conversion from forest to agriculture
   in the presence of REDD, and assess the performance of four baselines.
   We show that none of the analysed baselines dominates in all performance
   aspects, and that the final baseline choice needs to maximise the
   trade-off between the effectiveness to reduce deforestation,
   cost-efficiency, and changes in income. The frequently used historical
   average baseline could be improved by using a forward-looking one, which
   is shown to better account for the opportunity costs faced by
   landowners. This result hinges on the ability of the baseline to predict
   deforestation rates without significant underestimations. We advocate
   the switch from a single-threshold baseline to a corridor methodology,
   which would provide continued incentives to reduce deforestation, even
   during periods of high opportunity costs. We finally show how the
   selection of certain baseline attributes, such as corridor bandwidth and
   symmetry, can enhance performance.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial information of forest structural variables is crucial for
   sustainable forest management planning, forest monitoring, and the
   assessment of forest ecosystem productivity. We investigate a complex
   alpine forest ecosystem located in the Swiss National Park (SNP) and
   apply empirical models to retrieve the structural variables canopy
   closure, basal area, and timbervolume at plot scale. We used imaging
   spectrometer (IS) data from the Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) in
   combination with in-situ measurements of forest structural variables to
   develop empirical models. These models are based on simple and stepwise
   multiple regressions, while all potential two narrow-band combinations
   of the Simple Ratio (SR), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI), the perpendicular vegetation index (PVI), the second
   soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI2), and band depth indices were
   tested. The accuracy of the estimated structural attributes was
   evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. Using
   stepwise multiple regression models, we obtained a moderate to good
   accuracy when estimating canopy closure (R-2 = 0.81, rRMSE = 10\%),
   basal area (R-2 = 0.68, rRMSE = 20\%), and timber volume (R-2 = 0.73,

   estimates of canopy structural parameters considering the causality of
   light interaction and surface information.}},

Abstract = {{How to quantify the variability in ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE)
   of croplands is of vital importance. Especially in the context of
   changing hydrologic environment, much attention need to be paid on how
   to use limited water to improve crop yield. However, the biophysical
   performances of environmental/biological controls, crop types, and
   effects of diverse farming practices on WUE remain unclear. Therefore,
   this study aims to address these questions through tower-based
   measurements from eddy covariance and satellite-based estimates from
   MODIS GPP and ET products at the two annual soybean/corn rotation
   fields. The results exhibited that temperature and solar radiation are
   the most important meteorological factors. MODIS WUE estimates captured
   the broad trend of 8-day tower-based observations. However, ecosystem
   WUE was overpredicted at the seedling stage and after harvest, and was
   severely underestimated at the peak periods of maize, which was mainly
   ascribed to the uncertainties in MODIS GPP. Finally, we evaluated the
   effects of two farming practices (conventional vs alternative) on WUE
   and carbon sequence (NEE). On annual time scale, WUE of both soybean and
   maize are improved obviously under the alternative management whereas
   contrasting effects are observed on NEE. But the overall carbon balance
   for both treatments is nearly identical over 2-year rotation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Understanding the extent of morphological variation in the wild
   population of Aldabra giant tortoises is important for conservation, as
   morphological variation in captive populations has been interpreted as
   evidence for lingering genes from extinct tortoise lineages. If true,
   this could impact reintroduction programmes in the region. The
   population of giant tortoises on Aldabra Atoll is subdivided and
   distributed around several islands. Although pronounced morphological
   variation was recorded in the late 1960s, it was thought to be a
   temporary phenomenon. Early researchers also raised concerns over the
   future of the population, which was perceived to have exceeded its
   carrying capacity. We analyzed monthly monitoring data from 12 transects
   spanning a recent 15-year period (1998-2012) during which animals from
   four subpopulations were counted, measured, and sexed. In addition, we
   analyzed survival data from individuals first tagged during the early
   1970s. The population is stable with no sign of significant decline.
   Subpopulations differ in density, but these differences are mostly due
   to differences in the prevailing vegetation type. However,
   subpopulations differ greatly in both the size of animals and the degree
   of sexual dimorphism. Comparisons with historical data reveal that
   phenotypic differences among the subpopulations of tortoises on Aldabra
   have been apparent for the last 50years with no sign of diminishing. We
   conclude that the giant tortoise population on Aldabra is subject to
   varying ecological selection pressures, giving rise to stable
   morphotypes in discrete subpopulations. We suggest therefore that (1)
   the presence of morphological differences among captive Aldabra
   tortoises does not alone provide convincing evidence of genes from other
   extinct species; and (2) Aldabra serves as an important example of how
   conservation and management insitu can add to the scientific value of
   populations and perhaps enable them to better adapt to future ecological
   pressures.}},

Journal = {{AQUATIC BOTANY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{62-69}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Podostemaceae are unusual aquatic angiosperms growing as haptophytes in
   extreme habitats, i.e., rapids and waterfalls. They originated with an
   ecological shift from terrestrial life, followed by dispersal and
   diversification. It has been argued that the Tristichoideae originated
   on the Gondwana and diversified on the drifting continents. We aimed to
   test this hypothesis, focusing on the place of origin and the frequency
   and direction of dispersal. We used a Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis
   of phylogenetic relationships and comparative morphology for
   Podostemaceae. The results of the ML analysis showed that the family
   originated and then diverged to subfamilies Podostemoideae and
   Weddellinoideae in America, while the Tristichoideae most likely
   originated in Asia. Comparison with the sister family Hypericaceae
   indicated that Tristichoideae exhibit plesiomorphic states for all the
   morphological characters but pollen aperture, whereas Podostemoideae
   have apomorpic states. Under the island biogeography model, an Asian
   origin of Podostemaceae may be likely. Those American- and Asian-origin
   scenarios are contradictory and need further study. The biogeography of
   the major clades was shaped by several intercontinental dispersals
   followed by diversification in the colonized continents. A few
   dispersals happened on the continents of Africa, America and Asia,
   resulting in the dual biogeography of the continents. Repetition of
   diversification-dispersal-diversification is suggested by paraphyletic
   parental groups at higher and lower (species) taxonomic levels. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Biological responses to climatic change usually
   leave imprints on the genetic diversity and structure of plants.
   Information on the current genetic diversity and structure of dominant
   tree species has facilitated our general understanding of
   phylogeographical patterns.
   METHODS: Using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLPs), we
   compared genetic diversity and structure of 384 adults of P. tarapacana
   with those of 384 seedlings across 32 forest sites spanning a
   latitudinal gradient of 600 km occurring between 4100 m and 5000 m
   a.s.l. in Polylepis tarapacana (Rosaceae), one of the world's highest
   treeline species endemic to the central Andes.
   KEY RESULTS: Moderate to high levels of genetic diversity and low
   genetic differentiation were detected in both adults and seedlings, with
   levels of genetic diversity and differentiation being almost identical.
   Four slightly genetically divergent clusters were identified that
   accorded to differing geographical regions. Genetic diversity decreased
   from south to north and with increasing precipitation for adults and
   seedlings, but there was no relationship to elevation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that, unlike the case for other Andean
   treeline species, recent human activities have not affected the genetic
   structure of P. tarapacana, possibly because its inhospitable habitat is
   unsuitable for agriculture. The current genetic pattern of P. tarapacana
   points to a historically more widespread distribution at lower
   altitudes, which allowed considerable gene flow possibly during the
   glacial periods of the Pleistocene epoch, and also suggests that the
   northern Argentinean Andes may have served as a refugium for historical
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{As an important product of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS), MOD17A2 provides dramatic improvements in our ability to
   accurately and continuously monitor global terrestrial primary
   production, which is also significant in effort to advance scientific
   research and eco-environmental management. Over the past decades,
   forests have moderated climate change by sequestrating about one-quarter
   of the carbon emitted by human activities through fossil fuels burning
   and land use/land cover change. Thus, the carbon uptake by forests
   reduces the rate at which carbon accumulates in the atmosphere. However,
   the sensitivity of near real-time MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP)
   product is directly constrained by uncertainties in the modeling
   process, especially in complicated forest ecosystems. Although there
   have been plenty of studies to verify MODIS GPP with ground-based
   measurements using the eddy covariance (EC) technique, few have
   comprehensively validated the performance of MODIS estimates (Collection
   5) across diverse forest types. Therefore, the present study examined
   the degree of correspondence between MODIS-derived GPP and EC-measured
   GPP at seasonal and interannual time scales for the main forest
   ecosystems, including evergreen broadleaf forest (EBF), evergreen
   needleleaf forest (ENF), deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF), and mixed
   forest (MF) relying on 16 flux towers with a total of 68 site-year
   datasets. Overall, site-specific evaluation of multi-year mean annual
   GPP estimates indicates that the current MOD17A2 product works highly
   effectively for MF and DBF, moderately effectively for ENF, and
   ineffectively for EBF. Except for tropical forest, MODIS estimates could
   capture the broad trends of GPP at 8-day time scale for all other sites
   surveyed. On the annual time scale, the best performance was observed in
   MF, followed by ENF, DBF, and EBF. Trend analyses also revealed the poor
   performance of MODIS GPP product in EBF and DBF. Thus, improvements in
   the sensitivity of MOD17A2 to forest productivity require continued
   efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The terrain reversal effect is a perceptual phenomenon which causes an
   illusion in various 3D geographic visualizations where landforms appear
   inverted, e.g. we perceive valleys as ridges and vice versa. Given that
   such displays are important for spatio-visual analysis, this illusion
   can lead to critical mistakes in interpreting the terrain. However, it
   is currently undocumented how commonly this effect is experienced. In
   this paper, we study the prevalence of the terrain reversal effect in
   satellite imagery through a two-stage online user experiment. The
   experiment was conducted with the participation of a diverse and
   relatively large population (n = 535). Participants were asked to
   identify landforms (valley or ridge?) or judge a 3D spatial relationship
   (is A higher than B?). When the images were rotated by 180 degrees, the
   results were reversed. In a control task with illusion-free' original
   images, people were successful in identifying landforms, yet a very
   strong illusion occurred when these images were rotated 180 degrees. Our
   findings demonstrate that the illusion is acutely present; thus, we need
   a better understanding of the problem and its solutions. Additionally,
   the results caution us that in an interactive environment where people
   can rotate the display, we might be introducing a severe perceptual
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of climate change, both climate researchers and decision
   makers deal with uncertainties, but these uncertainties differ in
   fundamental ways. They stem from different sources, cover different
   temporal and spatial scales, might or might not be reducible or
   quantifiable, and are generally difficult to characterize and
   communicate. Hence, a mutual understanding between current and future
   climate researchers and decision makers must evolve for adaptation
   strategies and planning to progress. Iterative two-way dialogue can help
   to improve the decision making process by bridging current top-down and
   bottom-up approaches. One way to cultivate such interactions is by
   providing venues for these actors to interact and exchange on the
   uncertainties they face. We use a workshop-seminar series involving
   academic researchers, students, and decision makers as an opportunity to
   put this idea into practice and evaluate it. Seminars, case studies, and
   a round table allowed participants to reflect upon and experiment with
   uncertainties. An opinion survey conducted before and after the
   workshop-seminar series allowed us to qualitatively evaluate its
   influence on the participants. We find that the event stimulated new
   perspectives on research products and communication processes, and we
   suggest that similar events may ultimately contribute to the midterm
   goal of improving support for decision making in a changing climate.
   Therefore, we recommend integrating bridging events into university
   curriculum to foster interdisciplinary and iterative dialogue among
   researchers, decision makers, and students.}},

Abstract = {{Metropolitan decision-making in flexible policy networks based on
   voluntary cooperation is present in most industrialised countries and a
   widely debated topic in governance research. The research focus
   primarily lies on the ability of metropolitan governance networks to
   organise area-wide public service provision efficiently and effectively
   - as opposed to hierarchical, bureaucratic policy-making. However, the
   inherent lack of input-orientated democratic legitimacy in governance
   institutions has only recently come to the forefront of research. In the
   present article, the democratic deficit of metropolitan governance is
   investigated with respect to the role of the municipal councillors and
   their inclusion in such institutions. The objects of study are local
   councillors in Swiss metropolitan areas, where regional cooperation is
   traditionally organised in functional associations that correspond to
   the flexible, informal logic of governance networks. The impact of
   metropolitan governance on the councillors' political influence and on
   their behavioural patterns is assessed on the basis of large-scale
   survey data and comprehensive multilevel analyses accounting for the
   multilevel system of Swiss federalism.}},

Abstract = {{Aboveground biomass (AGB) of terrestrial ecosystems is an important
   constraint of global change and productivity models and used to assess
   carbon stocks and thus the contribution of vegetated ecosystems to the
   global carbon cycle. Although an indispensable and important requirement
   for decision makers, coherent and accurate estimates of grassland and
   forest AGB especially in complex environments are still lacking. In this
   study, we aim to assess the capability of two strategies to map
   grassland and forest AGB in a complex alpine ecosystem, i.e., using a
   discrete as well as a continuous field (CF) mapping approach based on
   imaging spectroscopy (IS) data. In situ measurements of grassland and
   forest AGB were acquired in the Swiss National Park (SNP) to calibrate
   empirical models and to validate AGB retrievals. The selection of robust
   empirical models considered all potential two narrow-band combinations
   of the simple ratio (SR) and the normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) generated from Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) IS data and in
   situ measurements. We found a narrow-band SR including spectral bands
   from the short-wave infrared (SWIR) (1689 nm) and near infrared (NIR)
   (851 nm) as the best regression model to estimate grassland AGB. Forest
   AGB showed highest correlation with an SR generated from two spectral
   bands in the SWIR (1498, 2112 nm). The applied accuracy assessment
   revealed good results for estimated grassland AGB using the discrete
   mapping approach {[}R-2 of 0.65, mean RMSE (mRMSE) of 0.91 t.ha(-1), and
   mean relative RMSE (mrRMSE) of 26\%]. The CF mapping approach produced a
   higher R-2 (R-2 = 0.94), and decreased the mRMSE and the mrRMSE to 0.55
   t.ha(-1) and 15\%, respectively. For forest, the discrete approach
   predicted AGB with an R-2 value of 0.64, an mRMSE of 67.8 t.ha(-1), and
   an mrRMSE of 25\%. The CF mapping approach improved the accuracy of
   forest AGB estimation with R-2 = 0.85, mean RMSE = 55.85 t.ha(-1), and
   mean relative RMSE = 21\%. Our results indicate that, in general, both
   mapping approaches are capable of accurately mapping grassland and
   forest AGB in complex environments using IS data, whereas the CF-based
   approach yielded higher accuracies due to its capability to incorporate
   subpixel information (abundances) of different land cover types.}},

Title = {{Plant diversity and community history shift colonization success from
   early- to mid-successional species}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{231-241}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   Functional traits are supposed to play an important role in determining
   the colonization success of new species into established communities.
   Short-term experimental studies have documented higher resistance of
   more diverse grasslands against colonization by new species. However,
   little is known about which traits colonizers should have to
   successfully invade diverse plant communities in the longer term and how
   community history may modify the resistance of diverse communities
   against colonization.
   Methods
   In a grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment) established
   with different species richness (SR; 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16) and functional
   group (FG) number and composition (1 to 4; legumes, grasses, small
   herbs, tall herbs), we studied colonization of naturally dispersed
   species in split-plots (i) with different duration of weeding (never
   weeded, weeded for 3 or 6 years and then un-weeded for 1 year) and (ii)
   with different duration of colonization (7 years, 4 years and 1 year
   after cessation of weeding).
   Important Findings
   Resistance against colonization by new species declined with increased
   duration of weeding (on average 13, 17 and 22 colonizer species in 1-,
   4- and 7-year-old communities, respectively). Communities established at
   low diversity accumulated more colonizer species with a longer duration
   of weeding than more diverse communities. Duration of colonization had
   only small effects on the number of colonizer species. Colonizers with
   early successional traits, i.e. annual life cycle, reproduction by
   seeds, small seeds, long-lived seeds and an earlier start of a longer
   flowering period, were favoured in species-poor newly established
   experimental plant communities (short duration of weeding) and early
   after cessation of weeding (short duration of colonization). A change
   from early-to mid-successional traits, i.e. taller growth, perennial
   life cycle, vegetative reproduction, characterized colonization at
   increased plant diversity and in communities with legumes or without
   grasses. Legume absence/grass presence and increased duration of weeding
   led to a shift in colonizer strategies from rapid nutrient uptake and
   cycling (higher specific leaf area) to nutrient retention and symbiotic
   N-2 fixation. Our study shows that non-random trait spectra of naturally
   dispersed colonizers encompass trade-offs between different functions
   (reproduction, persistence, growth) reflected in a change from early-to
   mid-successional traits at increasing plant diversity, with a longer
   duration of weeding and a longer time of colonization.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In humans, it is well known that the parental reproductive age has a
   strong influence on mutations transmitted to their progeny. Meiotic
   nondisjunction is known to increase in older mothers, and base
   substitutions tend to go up with paternal reproductive age. Hence, it is
   clear that the germinal mutation rates are a function of both maternal
   and paternal ages in humans. In contrast, it is unknown whether the
   parental reproductive age has an effect on somatic mutation rates in the
   progeny, because these are rare and difficult to detect. To address this
   question, we took advantage of the plant model system Arabidopsis
   (Arabidopsis thaliana), where mutation detector lines allow for an easy
   quantitation of somatic mutations, to test the effect of parental age on
   somatic mutation rates in the progeny. Although we found no significant
   effect of parental age on base substitutions, we found that frameshift
   mutations and transposition events increased in the progeny of older
   parents, an effect that is stronger through the maternal line. In
   contrast, intrachromosomal recombination events in the progeny decrease
   with the age of the parents in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner. Our
   results clearly show that parental reproductive age affects somatic
   mutation rates in the progeny and, thus, that some form of age-dependent
   information, which affects the frequency of double-strand breaks and
   possibly other processes involved in maintaining genome integrity, is
   transmitted through the gametes.}},

Abstract = {{Meat production and the transport sector contribute almost equally to
   global warming. However, unlike the transport sector, in terms of
   climate change policies meat production is relatively unregulated. Many
   scientists have called for a meat tax as a means of reducing consumption
   but governments and politicians have not responded. Has the law been an
   obstacle to the acceptance of a meat tax? To address that question, this
   article analyzes three examples of European Union (EU) taxes that could
   be imposed on the consumption of domestic and imported meat, and
   examines them in relation to the international climate change regime,
   human rights law, and the legal regimes of the World Trade Organization
   and the EU. It shows that, if carefully designed, an EU meat tax is
   consistent with these bodies of law. To address adequately the
   industrial sectors that give rise to global warming, governments will
   need to overcome the taboo relating to the concept of a meat tax.}},

Abstract = {{Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are common among plants, both as

   identified 38 VOCs, including 22 not previously recorded among ferns.
   The two species of Melpomene had distinct VOC cocktails, including 12
   substances not found in the other four studied genera, mainly involving
   fatty acid derivatives (FADs) and aromatics. We propose that these VOCs

   dominant in particular forest types and act as larval host plants for
   highly specialized Cymothoe butterflies. Despite their importance,
   species identification of African Rinorea is difficult and a taxonomic
   revision is needed. Previous phylogenetic studies have suggested that
   neotropical taxa are sister to a palaeotropical clade, with multiple
   independent dispersals to Madagascar, but these were based on plastid
   data only. We therefore present an updated phylogeny of Rinorea with
   increased sampling of African taxa, using plastid as well as nuclear DNA
   sequences. Phylogenetic relationships inferred from nuclear DNA data
   were generally congruent with those based on evidence from plastid
   haplotypes from earlier studies. Our increased taxonomic sampling also
   revealed previously undiscovered African Rinorea clades, some of which
   warrant further taxonomic study. Ancestral state reconstructions refute
   previous hypotheses about the evolution of morphological characters
   traditionally used for Rinorea infrageneric classification. In addition,
   some widespread species may comprise species complexes. It is clear that
   African Rinorea require comprehensive taxonomic revision; our
   contribution to understanding Rinorea infrageneric relationships will
   facilitate this task.}},

Abstract = {{In spatial epidemiology, disease incidence and demographic data are
   commonly summarized within larger regions such as administrative units
   because of privacy concerns. As a consequence, analyses using these
   aggregated data are subject to the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)
   as the geographical manifestation of ecological fallacy. In this study,
   we create small area disease estimates through dasymetric refinement,
   and investigate the effects on predictive epidemiological models. We
   perform a binary dasymetric refinement of municipality-aggregated dog
   tumor incidence counts in Switzerland for the year 2008 using
   residential land as a limiting ancillary variable. This refinement is
   expected to improve the quality of spatial data originally aggregated
   within arbitrary administrative units by deconstructing them into
   discontinuous subregions that better reflect the underlying population
   distribution. To shed light on effects of this refinement, we compare a
   predictive statistical model that uses unrefined administrative units
   with one that uses dasymetrically refined spatial units. Model
   diagnostics and spatial distributions of model residuals are assessed to
   evaluate the model performances in different regions. In particular, we
   explore changes in the spatial autocorrelation of the model residuals
   due to spatial refinement of the enumeration units in a selected
   mountainous region, where the rugged topography induces great shifts of
   the analytical units i.e., residential land. Such spatial data quality
   refinement results in a more realistic estimation of the population
   distribution within administrative units, and thus, in a more accurate
   modeling of dog tumor incidence patterns. Our results emphasize the
   benefits of implementing a dasymetric modeling framework in veterinary
   spatial epidemiology.}},

Title = {{Non-native megaherbivores: the case for novel function to manage plant
   invasions on islands}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{There is a heated debate about whether all non-native species are
   `guilty until proven innocent', or whether some should be accepted or
   even welcomed. Further fanning the flames, I here present a case where
   introductions of carefully vetted, non-native species could provide a
   net conservation benefit. On many islands, native megaherbivores
   (flightless birds, tortoises) recently went extinct. Here, rewilding
   with carefully selected non-native species as ecological replacements is
   increasingly considered a solution, reinstating a herbivory regime that
   largely benefits the native flora. Based on these efforts, I suggest
   that restoration practitioners working on islands without a history of
   native megaherbivores that are threatened by invasive plants should
   consider introducing a non-native island megaherbivore, and that large
   and giant tortoises are ideal candidates. Such tortoises would be
   equally useful on islands where eradication of invasive mammals has led
   to increased problems with invasive plants, or on islands that never had
   introduced mammalian herbivores, but where invasive plants are a
   problem. My proposal may seem radical, but the reversibility of using
   giant tortoises means that nothing is lost from trying, and that indeed
   much is to be gained. As an easily regulated adaptive management tool,
   it represents an innovative, hypothesis-driven `innocent until proven
   guilty' approach.}},

Abstract = {{Flagellariaceae are grass relatives that climb using leaf-tip tendrils
   in palaeotropical rainforests. As the sister group to Joinvilleaceae,
   Ecdeiocoleaceae and Poaceae, they could be indicative of the ancestral
   habitat of the graminid clade. Although four species are usually
   accepted in this monogeneric family, Flagellaria has never been revised
   taxonomically and species delimitation is understood poorly, especially
   for the Pacific. Here, we document the morphological variation in the
   genus, and explore phylogenetic patterns by maximum likelihood analysis
   (GARLI) and Bayesian inference (MrBayes) of the internal transcribed
   spacer (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal repeat and the plastid matK,
   psbA-trnH and rps16 regions. Ecological variation was inferred from
   climatic factors evaluated by MaxEnt analysis. We show that Flagellaria
   is more diverse than previously thought, and describe one new species in
   Fiji (Flagellaria collaris Wepfer \& H.P. Linder) and three new
   varieties in F. indica (vars. australiensis, bifurcata, borneensis).
   Flagellaria is most diverse in the Pacific islands, where Fiji harbours
   three of the five species.}},

   debushing, while being a good practice for increasing the mean pasture

Abstract = {{AimWe assessed the phenotypic responses of body size and organ weights
   of two small rodent species (Myodes glareolus and Apodemus flavicollis)
   to elevation, a surrogate for temperature and other environmental
   conditions. We expected not only an increase in body size (Bergmann's
   rule), but also an increase in relative heart weight with increasing
   elevation (Hesse's rule).
   LocationThe Bohemian Forest, south-eastern Germany.
   MethodsWe measured body length, body mass, and mass of the heart, lung,
   liver, kidneys and spleen of 386 adult specimens (188 of A flavicollis
   and 198 of M. glareolus) from 28 localities at 300-1450m a.s.l., and
   also recorded the number of ectoparasites. We analysed body length using
   linear mixed models, with site as a random factor and species, sex,
   population density and elevation as fixed factors, and included all
   two-way interactions between species and the remaining fixed variables.
   For the organ masses, we included body length and body mass in the
   calculations to account for allometric variation of organ mass with body
   size. For a subset of individuals, we sequenced the mitochondrial D-loop
   to analyse genetic variation along the elevational gradient.
   ResultsFor both species, we found no support for Bergmann's rule. The
   body size of A. flavicollis even decreased with elevation. In contrast,
   the relative heart weight of both species significantly increased with
   elevation, thereby supporting Hesse's rule. Lung mass also increased
   with elevation. The mass of other internal organs showed no such
   consistent relationship with elevation. Neither species showed genetic
   differentiation across the elevational gradient.
   Main conclusionsOur results suggest that both rodent species respond to
   increasing elevation by decreasing overall energy expenditure and by
   increasing overall aerobic capacity. In the context of climate change,
   our results indicate that biogeographers should pay more attention to
   the potential significance of genetic and/or phenotypic plasticity of
   relative organ mass to environmental heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Species inventories provide the basic information for biodiversity
   studies. Designing cost-effective species inventories is important in
   estimating the species richness or the number of additional species
   expected in a study area. Complete species inventories are difficult to
   achieve and a variety of estimation methods are available to counter the
   underestimation of species richness associated with incomplete sampling.
   A main criterion of selecting an estimation method requires deciding on
   a sampling unit type. The sampling unit may vary across study and
   estimating species richness using different sample units may produce
   different results. We evaluated the ability of incidence-based
   estimators of species richness to provide reliable estimates of species
   richness of temperate herpetofauna (i.e. amphibian and reptile)
   communities using two different types of sampling units (i.e. numbers of
   sampling days and the number of sampling sites, respectively). Our
   results showed that incidence-based estimators varied in their
   performance according to the two sampling units used. The
   incidence-based coverage estimator performed best when sampling unit was
   the number of sampling days whereas second-order Jackknife was the best
   estimator using sites as sampling unit. We draw attention on the lack of
   robustness of incidence-based estimators to sampling unit and recommend
   using species richness estimators in inventories of herpetofauna
   depending on the sampling unit. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Gene duplication is important in evolution, because it provides new raw
   material for evolutionary adaptations. Several existing hypotheses about
   the causes of duplicate retention and diversification differ in their
   emphasis on gene dosage, subfunctionalization, and neofunctionalization.
   Little experimental data exist on the relative importance of gene
   expression changes and changes in coding regions for the evolution of
   duplicate genes. Furthermore, we do not know how strongly the
   environment could affect this importance. To address these questions, we
   performed evolution experiments with the TEM-1 beta lactamase gene in
   Escherichia coli to study the initial stages of duplicate gene evolution
   in the laboratory. We mimicked tandem duplication by inserting two
   copies of the TEM-1 gene on the same plasmid. We then subjected these
   copies to repeated cycles of mutagenesis and selection in various
   environments that contained antibiotics in different combinations and
   concentrations. Our experiments showed that gene dosage is the most
   important factor in the initial stages of duplicate gene evolution, and
   overshadows the importance of point mutations in the coding region.}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of geodetic volume change are widely used in glaciology and
   have a long tradition dating back to the nineteenth century. Over time,
   the geodetic method and corresponding data storage have been developed
   further, but the resulting methodological heterogeneity can lead to
   errors that are difficult to separate from other survey uncertainties.
   In this study we used high-resolution airborne laser scanning data from
   the Findelengletscher in the Swiss Alps to evaluate state-of-the-art
   volumetric glacier change methods. For the first time we have been able
   to simulate errors arising from different geodetic methods and spatial
   resolutions. The evaluation showed that, although the digital elevation
   models were perfectly co-registered, systematic and random method- and
   scale-dependent errors still occurred. These errors have an impact on
   the resulting volume changes at lower spatial resolutions and may lead
   to exponentially larger uncertainties. Volume changes from contour
   methods provided reasonably accurate results, while volumetric change
   assessments from central profile lines were especially prone to biases
   at any scale.}},

Title = {{Continuous Fields From Imaging Spectrometer Data for Ecosystem Parameter
   Mapping and Their Potential for Animal Habitat Assessment in Alpine
   Regions}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing offers an objective and efficient way to monitor
   ecosystem properties including their spatial variability across
   different land cover types. Especially, the representation of gradients
   of biochemical and structural properties of ecosystems using continuous
   fields (CF) approaches bears advantages compared to discrete land cover
   classification schemes. This paper presents a concept to synergistically
   generate CF maps of an alpine ecosystem parameter, i.e., total surface
   water content, from imaging spectrometer (IS) data. Further, the
   potential of linking such maps to ecological patterns, i.e., the spatial
   distribution of large ungulates is being assessed. In vegetated areas,
   total surface water content is considered as a surrogate of plant
   physiological status. Water is, besides temperature, light, or
   nutrients, an important limiting growth factor determining biomass
   production and therefore potential animal forage quantity in alpine
   grasslands. Resource ecology interested in trophic interactions between
   large ungulates and their forage requires spatial and temporal
   information on ecosystem properties and processes. The study area is
   located in the upper Trupchun Valley (Val Trupchun) in the Swiss
   National Park (SNP). The valley is famous for its high densities of
   chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra L.), ibex (Capra ibex L.), and red deer
   (Cervus elaphus L.). CF maps of total surface water content were derived
   from Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) IS data collected over the SNP in
   June 2010 and 2011. Abundance maps of predominant land cover classes
   were derived from linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA). They were then
   combined with water content information of the respective land cover
   originating from either empirically or physically based approaches. The
   resulting CF maps depicted a spatially continuous representation of
   relative total surface water content. APEX IS data from two consecutive
   seasons revealed differences in total surface water content in June 2010
   and 2011, predominantly related to an advanced phenological development
   in spring 2011 and to considerable differences in snow cover between the
   2 years. Linking total surface water content of grasslands to observed
   ungulates spatial distributions did not reveal any statistically
   significant patterns of habitat use. We conclude that water availability
   in Val Trupchun may not be the dominant limiting factor for potential
   forage quantity (biomass), or that ungulates choose their grazing sites
   based on other criteria, i.e., high nutritious quality (P, N).
   Nevertheless, multitemporal CF maps derived from APEX IS data were found
   to provide spatially explicit and fine-scaled information for analyses
   of an ecosystem's total surface water content. The combination of
   multitemporal CF maps of a wide range of ecosystem parameters and more
   accurate and extensive observations of animal habitat use will
   contribute to ongoing and future vegetation-ungulates research in the
   SNP.}},

   system}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{567-574}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Apparent competition is of broad interest due to its effects on
   community structure and potential applications in agriculture,
   restoration, and medicine. It is well-established that apparent
   competition can result from changes in predator abundance or behavior
   caused by interactions with alternate prey, but no previous empirical
   study has demonstrated that apparent competition can also result from
   prey-induced changes in predator morphology. This trait-mediated
   alternative mechanism of apparent competition would expand the range of
   conditions under which apparent competition might occur in nature and
   identify new ways to generate or modify apparent competition in applied
   contexts. Here, as a proof of concept, we show that trait-mediated
   apparent competition can arise from inducible offenses and show how it
   operates using experiments involving three ciliates. When it feeds on
   Colpidium kleini, the intraguild predator Tetrahymena vorax increases in
   size to the extent that it can then consume Paramecium aurelia, an even
   larger prey. When feeding only on bacteria, however, Tetrahymena remains
   smaller and is unable to consume Paramecium. This trait-mediated
   indirect effect leads to the predatory exclusion of Paramecium, while
   Tetrahymena and Colpidium coexist. Developmental expansions such as
   those underlying the interactions observed in our study are not limited
   to ciliates, such as Tetrahymena, but occur among many diverse taxa and
   may have a surprising degree of influence over the structure and
   dynamics of food webs.}},

Title = {{The cytosolic thiouridylase CTU2 of Arabidopsis thaliana is essential
   for posttranscriptional thiolation of tRNAs and influences root
   development}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: A large number of post-transcriptional modifications of
   transfer RNAs (tRNAs) have been described in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
   They are known to influence their stability, turnover, and
   chemical/physical properties. A specific subset of tRNAs contains a
   thiolated uridine residue at the wobble position to improve the
   codon-anticodon interaction and translational accuracy. The proteins
   involved in tRNA thiolation are reminiscent of prokaryotic sulfur
   transfer reactions and of the ubiquitylation process in eukaryotes. In
   plants, some of the proteins involved in this process have been
   identified and show a high degree of homology to their non-plant
   equivalents. For other proteins, the identification of the plant
   homologs is much less clear, due to the low conservation in protein
   sequence.
   Results: This manuscript describes the identification of CTU2, the
   second CYTOPLASMIC THIOURIDYLASE protein of Arabidopsis thaliana. CTU2
   is essential for tRNA thiolation and interacts with ROL5, the previously
   identified CTU1 homolog of Arabidopsis. CTU2 is ubiquitously expressed,
   yet its activity seems to be particularly important in root tissue. A
   ctu2 knock-out mutant shows an alteration in root development.
   Conclusions: The analysis of CTU2 adds a new component to the so far
   characterized protein network involved in tRNA thiolation in
   Arabidopsis. CTU2 is essential for tRNA thiolation as a ctu2 mutant
   fails to perform this tRNA modification. The identified Arabidopsis CTU2

Abstract = {{Amphibian declines around the world are a major conservation concern.
   Monitoring trends in abundance is therefore important. Exemplar models
   are required, with robust, easily assessed indicators of population size
   that have high and consistent detection probability and which can be
   quantified over large geographical scales. Natterjack toads Bufo
   calamita potentially fulfil these criteria. This amphibian is rare and
   increasingly endangered in the north European part of its range,
   including Britain. In this paper, we analyse data on population size
   (based on spawn string counts) and breeding success (toadlet production)
   collected over 20 years from all remaining natterjack sites in the UK,
   permitting for the first time an assessment of population trends of an
   endangered amphibian at the national scale. State-space models, which
   account for observation error, were developed to estimate population
   trends and to assesss the effects of conservation management. Between
   1990 and 2009, the British population of B.calamita was approximately
   stable as judged by spawn string counts and broadly confirmed by
   state-space modelling, although this indicated that continuing small
   decline was more probable than stability. Empirical and model analyses
   also demonstrated that population growth rate was influenced positively
   by frequency of breeding success (toadlet production) and by grazing of
   the terrestrial habitat by domestic livestock. The implications of these
   findings for future conservation management of B.calamita are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Spatialized views use visuo-spatial metaphors to facilitate sense-making
   from complex non-spatial databases. Spatialization typically includes
   the projection of a high-dimensional (non-spatial) data space onto a
   lower dimensional display space for visual data exploration. In
   comparison to 2D spatialized displays, 3D displays could potentially
   convey more information, as they employ all three available spatial
   display dimensions. In this study, we evaluate if this advantage exists
   and whether it outweighs the added cognitive, perceptual, and
   technological costs of 3D displays. In a controlled human-subjects
   experiment, we investigated how viewers identify document similarity in
   3D network spatializations that depict news articles as points connected
   by links. Our quantitative findings suggest that similarity ratings for
   3D network displays are similar to those obtained in a prior 2D study we
   conducted. With both types of displays, viewers mostly judged document
   similarity on the basis of metric distances along network links, as
   opposed to node counts or distance across the network links. However,
   node counts do affect similarity assessments with 3D displays more than
   with 2D displays. We also find no significant differences in similarity
   judgments whether 3D displays are presented monoscopically or
   stereoscopically. We conclude that any advantage of 3D displays in
   conveying more information than 2D displays does not necessarily
   outweigh their additional demands on cognitive, perceptual, and
   technological resources.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate mapping of tree species composition within forest ecosystems is
   an important aspect of management planning and monitoring. Passive
   optical remote sensing in general and imaging spectroscopy (IS) in
   particular have played an important role in producing such maps, but are
   suffering from issues due to vegetation structure. On the other hand,
   the structural information provided by airborne laser scanning (ALS) was
   shown to be helpful for species discrimination, particularly in
   heterogeneous forests. In this paper, we investigate the potential of
   product-level fusion of IS and ALS to provide a better tree species
   differentiation based on their complementarity. Our results show that
   the fused tree species map does improve on the single system maps and
   more accurately provides the distribution and fraction of each tree

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Understanding which environmental conditions are critical for species
   survival is a critical, ongoing question in ecology. These conditions
   can range from climate, at the broadest scale, through to elevation and
   other local landscape conditions, to fine scale landscape patterns of
   land cover and use. Remote sensing is an ideal technology to monitor and
   assess changes in these environmental conditions at a variety of spatial
   and temporal scales, with many studies focusing on the physiological
   state of vegetation derived from time series of satellite measurements.
   As vegetation occurs within specific climatic zones, over certain soil,
   terrain, and land cover types, it can be difficult to decipher the
   influence of the underlying role of climate, topography, soil, and land
   cover on the observed vegetation signal. In this article, we
   specifically addressed this problem by asking the question: what is the
   relative impact and importance of these different scales of
   environmental drivers on the temporal and spatial patterns observed on a
   habitat index derived from remotely sensed data? To find the solution,
   we utilized a SPOT VEGETATION-normalized difference vegetation index
   time series of Europe to create a remote-sensing-derived habitat index,
   which incorporates aspects of productivity, seasonality, and cover. We
   then compared the observed temporal and spatial variations in the index
   to a pan-Europe terrestrial classification system, which explicitly
   incorporates variations in climate, terrain, soil parent material, land
   cover, and use. Results indicated that the most accurate level of
   discrimination from the habitat index was at the broadest level of the
   hierarchy, climate, while the poorest degree of discrimination was
   associated with elevation. In terms of similarity on the index across
   time and space, we found that arable and forest cover classes were more
   similar across elevation and parent materials than across other land
   cover types within them. Analyzing the remote-sensing index, at multiple
   scales, provides significant insights into the drivers of
   satellite-derived greenness indices, as well as highlights the benefit
   and cautions associated with linking satellite-derived indirect
   indicators to species distribution modeling and biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Does a giant tortoise taxon substitute enhance seed germination of
   exotic fleshy-fruited plants?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{57-63}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   The use of exotic species as taxon substitutes to restore lost
   ecological interactions is currently hotly debated. Aldabrachelys
   gigantea giant tortoises have recently been introduced to three islands
   in the Mascarene archipelago (Ile aux Aigrettes, Round Island and
   Rodrigues) to resurrect herbivory and seed dispersal functions once
   performed by extinct giant tortoises. However, potential unintended
   impacts by frugivore substitutes on native ecosystems, e. g. whether
   they will facilitate the germination of exotic plant species, are
   largely unknown. We investigated whether A. gigantea introduced to
   Rodrigues in 2006 could enhance the germination percentage of four
   widespread fleshy-fruited exotic species on the island. Using
   germination trials to forecast unintended impacts that could arise from
   the introduction of a frugivorous taxon substitute enables conservation
   managers to limit potential adverse negative interactions before they
   occur.
   Methods
   In germination trials that ran over 4 months, we investigated the
   effects of ingestion (gut passage and deposition in faeces) by sub-adult
   and adult A. gigantea on the germination percentage of four exotic
   fleshy-fruited plant species introduced to Rodrigues. We fed fruits of
   these plant species to sub-adult and adult A. gigantea to test how
   variation in age and size of the frugivore would affect seed
   germination. Feeding of distinctly coloured plastic pellets together
   with the fruits allowed us to test for individual tortoise effects on
   seed germination.
   Important Findings
   Ingestion by A. gigantea increased the percentage of seeds germinating
   of Mimusops coriacea and Lantana camara, but not percentage of
   germination of Veitchia merrillii or Wikstroemia indica. Seeds were more
   likely to germinate following ingestion by sub-adult rather than adult
   tortoises, which may be a consequence of the shorter gut passage time
   observed for sub-adults. Our results demonstrate that introduced
   frugivorous taxon substitutes could facilitate germination of exotic and
   invasive plants and highlight the need for conservation managers to
   weigh the risk of taxon substitutes potentially facilitating the
   germination and recruitment of exotic fleshy-fruited plants against the
   benefit of restoring lost seed dispersal functions of threatened
   indigenous plants. Our findings also highlight the importance of
   considering age and size variation in frugivores, in particular in
   long-lived taxa such as giant tortoises, when studying ingestion effects
   on the germination performance of plants.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of distribution and ecospace utilization of Late Ordovician
   brachiopods in a recently formed, contemporary meteorite crater are
   described and analyzed. Rhynchonelliformean brachiopod communities,
   dominated by a wide range of orthides and strophomenides, colonized the
   newly formed crater. At the crater rim communities were established
   early on, although the crater depression was not inhabited until
   deposition of the upper third of the remaining crater fill. The crater
   formed a protected but restricted microenvironment where sediments four
   times the thickness of the nearby basinal succession accumulated. Within
   this narrow space environments varied from shallow-water to
   deeper-waters, about 200 m in depth, and from well oxygenated to
   hypoxic. Such varied environments generated a rough ecological
   landscape, facilitating niche partitioning across a relatively small
   geographic area. Analysis of the guild structure of the fauna permits
   explanation of a local biodiversity hotspot in otherwise low-diversity
   strata elsewhere in the Scandinavian region. The Tvaren impact event had
   an important palaeobiologic effect upon the fossil record as it served
   as a local pump and reservoir for biodiversity. Moreover the development
   of new community types and narrowly-defined niches helped further drive
   both a and p biodiversity during a critical phase of the Great

Abstract = {{Surveys play a key role in researching public perceptions of and
   attitudes toward science. Accordingly, there is a breadth of often-used
   survey instruments available which have also been adopted for
   segmentation analyses. Even though many of these segmentation solutions
   are similar in their aims, they often include a large numbers of
   variables, making it more difficult for other researchers to build on
   these solutions, as survey time is scarce. Therefore, we demonstrate how
   a large number of variables that were used for a comprehensive
   segmentation analysis can be reduced considerably without losing too
   much information. We develop and test a short survey instrument to
   segment populations according to their attitudes toward science. Results
   show that segmentation results can be replicated with over 90\% accuracy
   by reducing the instrument from 20 to 10 variables. This reduction does
   not significantly affect the predictive power of segment attribution on
   three dependent variables, which suggests that many segmentation
   analyses could be similarly optimized, helping researchers save survey
   time and standardize segmentation analyses more.}},

Abstract = {{Global change and human expansion have resulted in many species
   extinctions worldwide, but the geographic variation and determinants of
   extinction risk in particular guilds still remain little explored. Here,
   we quantified insular extinctions of frugivorous vertebrates (including
   birds, mammals and reptiles) across 74 tropical and subtropical oceanic
   islands within 20 archipelagos worldwide and investigated extinction in
   relation to island characteristics (island area, isolation, elevation
   and climate) and species' functional traits (body mass, diet and ability
   to fly). Out of the 74 islands, 33 islands (45\%) have records of
   frugivore extinctions, with one third (mean: 34\%, range: 2-100\%) of
   the pre-extinction frugivore community being lost. Geographic areas with
   more than 50\% loss of pre-extinction species richness include islands
   in the Pacific (within Hawaii, Cook Islands and Tonga Islands) and the
   Indian Ocean (Mascarenes, Seychelles). The proportion of species
   richness lost from original pre-extinction communities is highest on
   small and isolated islands, increases with island elevation, but is
   unrelated to temperature or precipitation. Large and flightless species
   had higher extinction probability than small or volant species. Across
   islands with extinction events, a pronounced downsizing of the frugivore
   community is observed, with a strong extinction-driven reduction of mean
   body mass (mean: 37\%, range: -18-100\%) and maximum body mass (mean:
   51\%, range: 0-100\%). The results document a substantial trophic
   downgrading of frugivore communities on oceanic islands worldwide, with
   a non-random pattern in relation to geography, island characteristics
   and species' functional traits. This implies severe consequences for
   ecosystem processes that depend on mutualistic plant-animal
   interactions, including ecosystem dynamics that result from the
   dispersal of large-seeded plants by large-bodied frugivores. We suggest
   that targeted conservation and rewilding efforts on islands are needed
   to halt the defaunation of large and non-volant seed dispersers and to
   restore frugivore communities and key ecological interactions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Human activities exert stress on and create disturbances to
   ecosystems, decreasing their diversity, resilience and ultimately the
   health of ecosystems and their vegetation. In environments with rapid
   changes in vegetation health (VH), progress is needed when it comes to
   monitoring these changes and underlying causes. There are different
   approaches to monitoring VH such as in situ species approaches and the
   remote-sensing approach.
   2. Here we provide an overview of in situ species approaches, that is,
   the biological, the phylogenetic, and the morphological species concept,
   as well as an overview of the remote-sensing spectral trait/spectral
   trait variations concept to monitor the status of VH as well as
   processes of stress, disturbances, and resource limitations affecting
   VH. The approaches are compared with regard to their suitability for
   monitoring VH, and their advantages, disadvantages, potential, and
   requirements for being linked are discussed.
   3. No single approach is sufficient to monitor the complexity and
   multidimensionality of VH over the short to long term and on local to
   global scales. Rather, every approach has its pros and cons, making it
   all the more necessary to link approaches. In this paper, we present a
   framework and list crucial requirements for coupling approaches and
   integrating additional monitoring elements to form a multisource
   vegetation health monitoring network (MUSO-VH-MN).
   4. When it comes to linking the different approaches, data, information,
   models or platforms in a MUSO-VH-MN, big data with its complexity and
   syntactic and semantic heterogeneity and the lack of standardized
   approaches and VH protocols pose the greatest challenge. Therefore, Data
   Science with the elements of (a) digitalization, (b) semantification,
   (c) ontologization, (d) standardization, (e) Open Science, as well as
   (f) open and easy analyzing tools for assessing VH are important
   requirements for monitoring, linking, analyzing, and forecasting complex
   and multidimensional changes in VH.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Predation is a major factor influencing the fitness and life history of
   animals. Two key traits affecting prey survival are body size and
   coloration. Sepsis thoracica males display a sigmoid relationship
   between these 2 traits, defining a size threshold above which investment
   in melanin drastically drops, producing small melanic (black) or large
   amber morphs. In trying to understand the evolution of this rare
   dimorphism, we performed laboratory predation experiments to estimate
   the intensity of adult viability selection exerted by various arthropod
   predators (bugs, flies, and spiders) on male body size and coloration.
   Selection was performed against 2 different backgrounds mimicking the
   natural habitat (dung and grass) in which the camouflage and/or warning
   effect of the morphs should vary. Body size was mainly under positive
   selection (larger survived better), which overpowered selection on
   coloration and varied somewhat among predator species but not
   backgrounds. No disruptive selection was found, nor did selection change
   the sigmoid relationship between the 2 traits. We conclude that, for
   this fly, predator evasion and escaping skills determined by body size
   are more effective against invertebrate predators than its
   conspicuousness determined by coloration, contrasting what has been
   found for vertebrate predators, where prey coloration is important and
   negative selection on size dominates. Because arthropod predators have
   strong effects on insect populations, the positive directional selection
   imposed by invertebrate predators is likely an important force driving
   the evolution of body size in S. thoracica and insects in general.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Small bacterivorous eukaryotes play a cardinal role in aquatic food webs
   and their taxonomic classification is currently a hot topic in aquatic
   microbial ecology. Despite increasing interest in their diversity, core
   questions regarding predator-prey specificity remain largely unanswered,
   e.g., which heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNFs) are the main
   bacterivores in freshwaters and which prokaryotes support the growth of
   small HNFs. To answer these questions, we fed natural communities of
   HNFs from Rimov reservoir (Czech Republic) with five different bacterial
   strains of the ubiquitous betaproteobacterial genera Polynucleobacter
   and Limnohabitans. We combined amplicon sequencing and catalyzed
   reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH)
   targeting eukaryotic 18 S rRNA genes to track specific responses of the
   natural HNF community to prey amendments. While amplicon sequencing
   provided valuable qualitative data and a basis for designing specific
   probes, the number of reads was insufficient to accurately quantify
   certain eukaryotic groups. We also applied a double-hybridization
   technique that allows simultaneous phylogenetic identification of both
   predator and prey. Our results show that community composition of HNFs
   is strongly dependent upon prey type. Surprisingly, Cryptophyta were the
   most abundant bacterivores, although this phylum has been so far assumed
   to be mainly autotrophic. Moreover, the growth of a small lineage of
   Cryptophyta (CRY1 clade) was strongly stimulated by one Limnohabitans
   strain in our experiment. Thus, our study is the first report that
   colorless Cryptophyta are major bacterivores in summer plankton samples
   and can play a key role in the carbon transfer from prokaryotes to
   higher trophic levels.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity in response to competition is a well-described
   phenomenon in higher organisms. Here, we show that also bacteria have
   the ability to sense the presence of competitors and mount fine-tuned
   responses to match prevailing levels of competition. In our experiments,
   we studied interspecific competition for iron between the bacterium
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and its competitor Burkholderia cenocepacia
   (BC). We focused on the ability of PA to phenotypically adjust the
   production of pyoverdine, an iron-scavenging siderophore. We found that
   PA upregulates pyoverdine production early on during competition under
   condition of low iron availability. This plastic upregulation was
   fine-tuned in response to the level of competition imposed by BC, and
   seems to confer a relative fitness benefit to PA in the form of an
   earlier initiation of growth. At later time points, however, PA showed
   reduced growth in mixed compared to monoculture, suggesting that
   competitive responses are costly. Altogether, our results demonstrate
   that phenotypic plasticity in siderophore production plays an important
   role in interspecific competition for iron. Upregulating siderophore
   production may be a powerful strategy to lock iron away from competing
   species, and to reserve this nutrient for strain members possessing the
   compatible receptor for uptake.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has recently become the method
   of choice to define and analyze transcriptomes. For the model moss
   Physcomitrella patens, although this method has been used to help
   analyze specific perturbations, no overall reference dataset has yet
   been established. In the framework of the Gene Atlas project, the Joint
   Genome Institute selected P.patens as a flagship genome, opening the way
   to generate the first comprehensive transcriptome dataset for this moss.
   The first round of sequencing described here is composed of 99
   independent libraries spanning 34 different developmental stages and
   conditions. Upon dataset quality control and processing through read
   mapping, 28509 of the 34361 v3.3 gene models (83\%) were detected to be
   expressed across the samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were
   calculated across the dataset to permit perturbation comparisons between
   conditions. The analysis of the three most distinct and abundant
   P.patens growth stages - protonema, gametophore and sporophyte - allowed
   us to define both general transcriptional patterns and stage-specific
   transcripts. As an example of variation of physico-chemical growth
   conditions, we detail here the impact of ammonium supplementation under
   standard growth conditions on the protonemal transcriptome. Finally, the
   cooperative nature of this project allowed us to analyze
   inter-laboratory variation, as 13 different laboratories around the
   world provided samples. We compare differences in the replication of
   experiments in a single laboratory and between different laboratories.}},

Title = {{Investigating sense of place as a cultural ecosystem service in
   different landscapes through the lens of language}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},

Abstract = {{The concept of ecosystem services is increasingly important for
   measuring both tangible and intangible benefits that humans obtain from
   ecosystems. Much research on ecosystem services focused on more tangible
   services. Intangible cultural ecosystem services, such as sense of
   place, are often neglected, but in the context of highly populated,
   increasingly urbanized countries, maintenance of cultural ecosystem
   services is an important policy objective. One of the challenges of
   integrating sense of place into the framework of ecosystem services is
   that it is not linked to abstract notions of ecosystems, but tied to
   perceived landscape features such as mountains, or rivers. In this
   study, we used free listings and interviews with visitors to investigate
   perceived landscape features and sense of place through the lens of
   language in five different landscape types in Switzerland. Within each
   landscape type, we selected two study sites to quantitatively and
   qualitatively compare landscape descriptions. Using text processing, we
   show that terms for landscape features were more similar within the same
   landscape type, suggesting that people perceive differences between
   these landscapes that they express in language. However, in general,
   elicited concepts related to sense of place were similar across
   landscape types. Thus, our results show that we can use free-listing
   descriptions to distinguish landscape types, but we found limited
   differences in the language used to describe sense of place. Our
   findings offer insights into exploring sense of place in different
   landscapes and contribute to ongoing efforts for refining the
   definitions and standardizing assessments of cultural ecosystem
   services.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of antibiotics in treated wastewater and consequently in
   surface and groundwater resources raises concerns about the formation
   and spread of antibiotic resistance. Improving the removal of
   antibiotics during wastewater treatment therefore is a prime objective
   of environmental engineering. Here we obtained a detailed picture of the
   fate of sulfonamide antibiotics during activated sludge treatment using
   a combination of analytical methods. We show that pterin-sulfonamide
   conjugates, which are formed when sulfonamides interact with their
   target enzyme to inhibit folic acid synthesis, represent a major
   biotransformation route for sulfonamides in laboratory batch experiments
   with activated sludge. The same major conjugates were also present in
   the effluents of nine Swiss wastewater treatment plants. The
   demonstration of this biotransformation route, which is removal. related
   to bacterial growth, helps explain seemingly contradictory views on
   optimal conditions for sulfonamide More importantly, since
   pterin-sulfonamide conjugates show retained antibiotic activity, our
   findings suggest that risk from exposure to sulfonamide antibiotics may
   be less reduced during wastewater treatment than previously assumed. Our
   results thus further emphasize the inadequacy of focusing on parent
   compound removal and the importance of investigating biotransformation
   pathways and removal of bioactivity to properly assess contaminant
   removal in both engineered and natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain ecosystems are sensitive and reliable indicators of climate
   change. Long-term studies may be extremely useful in assessing the
   responses of high-elevation ecosystems to climate change and other
   anthropogenic drivers from a broad ecological perspective. Mountain
   research sites within the LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) network
   are representative of various types of ecosystems and span a wide
   bioclimatic and elevational range. Here, we present a synthesis and a
   review of the main results from ecological studies in mountain
   ecosystems at 20 LTER sites in Italy, Switzerland and Austria covering
   in most cases more than two decades of observations. We analyzed a set
   of key climate parameters, such as temperature and snow cover duration,
   in relation to vascular plant species composition, plant traits,
   abundance patterns, pedoclimate, nutrient dynamics in soils and water,
   phenology and composition of freshwater biota.
   The overall results highlight the rapid response of mountain ecosystems
   to climate change, with site-specific characteristics and rates. As
   temperatures increased, vegetation cover in alpine and subalpine summits
   increased as well. Years with limited snow cover duration caused an
   increase in soil temperature and microbial biomass during the growing
   season. Effects on freshwater ecosystems were also observed, in terms of
   increases in solutes, decreases in nitrates and changes in plankton
   phenology and benthos communities. This work highlights the importance
   of comparing and integrating long-term ecological data collected in
   different ecosystems for a more comprehensive overview of the ecological
   effects of climate change. Nevertheless, there is a need for (i)
   adopting co-located monitoring site networks to improve our ability to
   obtain sound results from cross-site analysis, (ii) carrying out further
   studies, in particular short-term analyses with fine spatial and
   temporal resolutions to improve our understanding of responses to
   extreme events, and (iii) increasing comparability and standardizing
   protocols across networks to distinguish local patterns from global
   patterns. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection has 2 main components, female preference and male--male
   competition, which can lead males to adopt alternative reproductive
   tactics to optimize their reproductive success. Two traits that
   significantly influence reproductive success are body size and
   coloration, as they can facilitate access to females through male
   contests or as female attractors. We investigated whether, and if so
   which mechanism of sexual selection contributes to the maintenance, and
   possibly even the establishment, of 2 almost discrete male morphs in the
   polyphenic black scavenger fly Sepsis thoracica (Diptera: Sepsidae):
   small and black, or large and amber. We performed 2 complementary
   laboratory experiments to evaluate the mating success of the different
   male morphs and the behaviors (of both males and females) presumably
   mediating their mating success. We found evidence for intraspecific
   disruptive sexual selection on male body size that is mediated by
   male-male interactions, and significant positive directional selection
   on body size that interacted with (directional) selection on coloration,
   likely contributing to the origin and/or maintenance of the threshold
   relationship between the 2 traits in this species. The simultaneous
   occurrence of disruptive selection and polyphenism in S. thoracica
   supports the role of sexual selection in the intraspecific
   diversification of coupled traits (here body size and coloration), which
   could be a speciation starting point.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Dispersal is a key process governing the dynamics of socially and
   spatially structured populations and involves three distinct stages:
   emigration, transience and settlement. At each stage, individuals have
   to make movement decisions, which are influenced by social,
   environmental and individual factors. Yet, a comprehensive understanding
   of the drivers that influence such decisions is still lacking,
   particularly for the transient stage during which free-living
   individuals are inherently difficult to follow.
   2. Social circumstances such as the likelihood of encountering
   conspecifics can be expected to strongly affects decision-making during
   dispersal, particularly in territorial species where encounters with
   resident conspecifics are antagonistic. Here, we analysed the movement
   trajectories of 47 dispersing coalitions of Kalahari meerkats Suricata
   suricatta through a landscape occupied by constantly monitored resident
   groups, while simultaneously taking into account environmental and
   -individual characteristics.
   3. We used GPS locations collected on resident groups to create a
   georeferenced social landscape representing the likelihood of
   encountering resident groups. We used a step-selection function to infer
   the effect of social, environmental and individual covariates on habitat
   selection during dispersal. Finally, we created a temporal mismatch
   between the social landscape and the dispersal event of interest to
   identify the temporal scale at which dispersers perceive the social
   landscape.
   4. Including information about the social landscape considerably
   improved our representation of the dispersal trajectory compared to
   analyses that only accounted for environmental variables. The latter
   were only marginally selected or avoided by dispersers. Before leaving
   their natal territory, dispersers selected areas frequently used by
   their natal group. In contrast, after leaving their natal territory,
   they selectively used areas where they were less likely to encounter
   unrelated groups. This pattern was particularly marked in larger
   dispersing coalitions and when unrelated males were part of the
   dispersing coalition.
   5. Our results suggest that, in socially and spatially structured
   species, dispersers gather and process social information during
   dispersal, and that reducing risk of aggression from unrelated resident
   groups outweighs benefits derived from conspecific attraction. Finally,
   our work underlines the intimate link between the social structure of a
   population and dispersal, which affect each other reciprocally.}},

Abstract = {{On 26 June 2008, a rock avalanche detached in the northeast facing slope
   of Polvartinden, a high-alpine mountain in Signaldalen, northern Norway.
   Here, we report on the observed and modelled past and present
   near-surface temperature regime close to the failure zone, as well as on
   a subsequent simulation of the subsurface temperature regime, and on
   initial geomechanical mapping based on laser scanning. The volume of the
   rock avalanche was estimated to be approximately 500 000 m(3). The depth
   to the actual failure surface was found to range from 40 m at the back
   of the failure zone to 0 m at its toe. Visible in situ ice was observed
   in the failure zone just after the rock avalanche. Between September
   2009 and August 2013, ground surface temperatures were measured with
   miniature temperature data loggers at 14 different localities, close to
   the original failure zone along the northern ridge of Polvartinden and
   on the valley floor. The results from these measurements and from a
   basic three-dimensional heat conduction model suggest that the lower
   altitudinal limit of permafrost at present is at 600-650 m a.s.l., which
   corresponds to the upper limit of the failure zone. A coupling of our in
   situ data with regional climate data since 1958 suggests a general
   gradual warming and that the period with highest mean near surface
   temperatures on record ended four months before the Signaldalen rock
   avalanche detached. A comparison with a transient permafrost model run
   at 10 m depth, representative for areas where snow accumulates,
   strengthen these findings, which are also in congruence with
   measurements in nearby permafrost boreholes. It is likely that
   permafrost in and near the failure zone is presently subject to
   degradation. This degradation, in combination with the extreme warm year
   antecedent to the rock failure, is seen to have played an important role
   in the detaching of the Signaldalen rock avalanche.}},

Abstract = {{The combined effects of enhanced total transgene expression level and
   allele-specificity combination in transgenic allele-pyramided Pm3 wheat
   lines result in improved powdery mildew field resistance without
   negative pleiotropic effects.
   Allelic Pm3 resistance genes of wheat confer race-specific resistance to
   powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) and encode
   nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors.
   Transgenic wheat lines overexpressing alleles Pm3a, b, c, d, f, and g
   have previously been generated by transformation of cultivar Bobwhite
   and tested in field trials, revealing varying degrees of powdery mildew
   resistance conferred by the transgenes. Here, we tested four transgenic
   lines each carrying two pyramided Pm3 alleles, which were generated by
   crossbreeding of lines transformed with single Pm3 alleles. All four
   allele-pyramided lines showed strongly improved powdery mildew
   resistance in the field compared to their parental lines. The improved
   resistance results from the two effects of enhanced total transgene
   expression levels and allele-specificity combinations. In contrast to
   leaf segment tests on greenhouse-grown seedlings, no allelic suppression
   was observed in the field. Plant development and yield scores of the
   pyramided lines were similar to the mean scores of the corresponding
   parental lines, and thus, the allele pyramiding did not cause any
   negative effects. On the contrary, in pyramided line, Pm3b x Pm3f normal
   plant development was restored compared to the delayed development and
   reduced seed set of parental line Pm3f. Allele-specific RT qPCR revealed
   additive transgene expression levels of the two Pm3 alleles in the
   pyramided lines. A positive correlation between total transgene
   expression level and powdery mildew field resistance was observed. In
   summary, allele pyramiding of Pm3 transgenes proved to be successful in
   enhancing powdery mildew field resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The fungus Zymoseptoria tritici causes septoria tritici blotch (STB) on
   wheat, an important disease globally and the most damaging wheat disease
   in Europe. Despite the global significance of STB, the molecular basis
   of wheat defense against Z. tritici is poorly understood. Here, we use a
   comparative transcriptomic study to investigate how wheat responds to
   infection by four distinct strains of Z. tritici. We examined the
   response of wheat across the entire infection cycle, identifying both
   shared responses to the four strains and strain-specific responses. We
   found that the early asymptomatic phase is characterized by strong
   upregulation of genes encoding receptor-like kinases and
   pathogenesis-related proteins, indicating the onset of a defense
   response. We also identified genes that were differentially expressed
   among the four fungal strains, including genes related to defense. Genes
   involved in senescence were induced during both the asymptomatic phase
   and at late stages of infection, suggesting manipulation of senescence
   processes by both the plant and the pathogen. Our findings illustrate
   the need, when identifying important genes affecting disease resistance
   in plants, to include multiple pathogen strains.}},

Title = {{Palaeoclimate, glacier and treeline reconstruction based on geomorphic
   evidences in the Mongun-Taiga massif (south-eastern Russian Altai)
   during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the extent of glaciers and dynamics of the
   landscape in south-eastern Russian Altai. The effects of climate-induced
   fluctuations of the glaciers and the upper treeline of the Mongun-Taiga
   mountain massif were, therefore, reconstructed on the basis of in-situ,
   multiannual observations, geomorphic mapping, radiocarbon and surface
   exposure dating, relative dating (such as Schmidt-hammer and weathering
   rind) techniques and palaeoclimate-modelling.
   During the maximal advance of the glaciers, their area was 26-times
   larger than now and the equilibrium line of altitude (ELA) was about
   800m lower. Assuming that the maximum glacier extent took place during
   MIS 4, then the average summer temperatures were 2.7 degrees C cooler
   than today and the amount of precipitation 2.1 times higher. Buried wood
   trunks by a glacier gave ages between 60 and 28 cal ka BP and were found
   600-700m higher than the present upper treeline. This evidences a
   distinctly elevated treeline during MIS 3a and c. With a correction for
   tectonics we reconstructed the summer warming to have been between 2.1
   and 3.0 degrees C. During MIS 3c, the glaciated area was reduced to less
   than 0.5 km(2) with an increase of the ELA of 310-470m higher than
   today. Due to higher precipitation, the glaciated area during MIS 3a was
   close to the current ELA. Exposure dating (Be-10) would indicate that
   the maximum glacier extension was 24 ka BP, but the results are
   questionable. From a geomorphic point of view, the maximum extent can
   more likely be ascribed to the MIS4 stage. We estimate a cooling of
   summer temperature of -3.8 to -4.2 degrees C and a decrease in
   precipitation of 37-46\% compared to the present-day situation. Samples
   of wood having an age of 10.6-6.2 cal ka BP were found about 350m higher
   than the present treeline. It seems that the summer temperature was
   2.0-2.5 degrees C higher and annual precipitation was double that of the
   present-day. For that period, the reconstructed glaciation area was 1
   km2 less than today. Three neoglacial glacier advances were detected.
   The glaciers covered about double the area during the Little Ice Age
   (LIA), summer cooling was 1.3 degrees C with 70\% of the present-day
   precipitation. The reconstructed amplitude of climatic changes and the
   shift of the altitudinal zones show that the landscape has reacted
   sensitively to environmental changes and that dramatic changes may occur
   in the near future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

Abstract = {{Climate change, globalization, urbanization, social isolation, and
   increased interconnectedness between physical, human, and technological
   systems pose major challenges to disaster risk reduction (DRR).
   Subsequently, economic losses caused by natural hazards are increasing
   in many regions of the world, despite scientific progress, persistent
   policy action, and international cooperation. We argue that these
   dramatic figures call for novel scientific approaches and new types of
   data collection to integrate the two main approaches that still dominate
   the science underpinning DRR: the hazard paradigm and the vulnerability
   paradigm. Building from these two approaches, here we propose a research
   framework that specifies the scope of enquiry, concepts, and general
   relations among phenomena. We then discuss the essential steps to
   advance systematic empirical research and evidence-based DRR policy
   action.
   Plain Language Summary The recent deadly earthquake in Iran-Iraq has
   been yet another reminder of the topicality of natural hazards, and it
   has come just after an unprecedented series of catastrophic events,
   including the extensive flooding in South Asia and the string of
   devastating hurricanes in the Americas. He we identify three main
   puzzles in the nexus of natural hazards and vulnerabilities, and
   demonstrate how novel approaches are needed to solve them with reference
   to a flood risk example. Specifically, we show how a new research
   framework can guide systematic data collections to advance the
   fundamental understanding of socionatural interactions, which is an
   essential step to improve the development of policies for disaster risk
   reduction.}},

Abstract = {{During leaf senescence and fruit ripening, chlorophyll is degraded in a
   multistep pathway into linear tetrapyrroles called phyllobilins. A key
   feature of chlorophyll breakdown is the removal of the hydrophobic
   phytol chain that renders phyllobilins water soluble, an important
   prerequisite for their ultimate storage in the vacuole of senescent
   cells. Chlorophyllases had been considered for more than a century to
   catalyze dephytylation in vivo; however, this was recently refuted.
   Instead, pheophytinase was discovered as a genuine in vivo phytol
   hydrolase. While chlorophyllase acts rather unspecifically towards
   different porphyrin substrates, pheophytinase was shown to specifically
   dephytylate pheophytin, namely Mg-free chlorophyll. The aim of this work
   was to elucidate in detail the biochemical and structural properties of
   pheophytinase. By testing different porphyrin substrates with
   recombinant pheophytinase from Arabidopsis thaliana we show that
   pheophytinase has high specificity for the acid moiety of the ester
   bond, namely the porphyrin ring, while the nature of the alcohol, namely
   the phytol chain in pheophytin, is irrelevant. In silico modelling of
   the 3-dimensional structure of pheophytinase and subsequent analysis of
   site-directed pheophytinase mutant forms allowed the identification of
   the serine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues that compose the
   catalytic triad, a classical feature of serine-type hydrolases to which
   both pheophytinase and chlorophyllase belong. Based on substantial
   structural differences in the models of Arabidopsis pheophytinase and
   chlorophyllase 1, we discuss potential differences in the catalytic
   properties of these two phytol hydrolases.}},

Abstract = {{Grounded in ethnographic fieldwork in and around a Malaysian apartment
   building, this paper explores discourses on and practices of friendship
   among young Iranian residents. The paper argues that for Iranians in
   Malaysia, most of them students, forming close social ties always holds
   the risk not only of personal betrayal but also of political
   infiltration, and thus making friends is informed by suspicion, anxiety
   and ambivalence. In the context of both formal state surveillance and
   informal moral policing in the high-rise, Iranian students often choose
   to keep their distance' from other Iranians. By analysing quotidian
   mutual observation and questioning, mistrust, but also forms of
   sociality that develop in the dense, cosmopolitan urban contact zone of
   an apartment building, this paper teases out conflicted narratives about
   intimacy and distance, and argues that these must be understood in the
   context of the local, material urban landscape of the high-rise, the
   uncertainty of life in transit as well as the political context of
   Post-Revolution Iran.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput genotyping of Swiss bread wheat and spelt accessions
   revealed differences in their gene pools and identified bread wheat
   landraces that were not used in breeding.
   Genebanks play a pivotal role in preserving the genetic diversity
   present among old landraces and wild progenitors of modern crops and
   they represent sources of agriculturally important genes that were lost
   during domestication and in modern breeding. However, undesirable genes
   that negatively affect crop performance are often co-introduced when
   landraces and wild crop progenitors are crossed with elite cultivars,
   which often limit the use of genebank material in modern breeding
   programs. A detailed genetic characterization is an important
   prerequisite to solve this problem and to make genebank material more
   accessible to breeding. Here, we genotyped 502 bread wheat and 293 spelt
   accessions held in the Swiss National Genebank using a 15K wheat SNP
   array. The material included both spring and winter wheats and consisted
   of old landraces and modern cultivars. Genome- and sub-genome-wide
   analyses revealed that spelt and bread wheat form two distinct gene
   pools. In addition, we identified bread wheat landraces that were
   genetically distinct from modern cultivars. Such accessions were
   possibly missed in the early Swiss wheat breeding program and are
   promising targets for the identification of novel genes. The genetic
   information obtained in this study is appropriate to perform genome-wide
   association studies, which will facilitate the identification and
   transfer of agriculturally important genes from the genebank into modern
   cultivars through marker-assisted selection.}},

Abstract = {{The timing of sex in facultatively sexual organisms is critical to
   fitness, due to the differing demographic consequences of sexual versus
   asexual reproduction. In addition to the costs of sex itself, an
   association of sex with the production of dormant life stages also
   influences the optimal use of sex, especially in environments where
   resting eggs are essential to survive unfavourable conditions. Here we
   document population dynamics and the occurrence of sexual reproduction
   in natural populations of Daphnia magna across their growing season. The
   frequency of sexually reproducing females and males increased with
   population density and with decreasing asexual clutch sizes. The
   frequency of sexually reproducing females additionally increased as
   population growth rates decreased. Consistent with population dynamic
   models showing that the opportunity cost of sexual reproduction
   (foregoing contribution to current population growth) diminishes as
   populations approach carrying capacity, we found that investment in
   sexual reproduction was highest when asexual population growth was low
   or negative. Our results support the idea that the timing of sex is
   linked with periods when the relative cost of sex is reduced due to low
   potential asexual growth at high population densities. Thus, a
   combination of ecological and demographic factors affect the optimal
   timing of sexual reproduction, allowing D. magna to balance the
   necessity of sex against its costs.}},

Title = {{Identifying drivers of breeding success in a long-distance migrant using

Journal = {{OIKOS}},

Volume = {{127}},

Abstract = {{In migrant animals, conditions encountered at various times and places
   throughout their annual cycle may affect breeding success. Yet, most
   studies so far have only investigated the effect of specific parts of
   the annual cycle, despite the importance to understand how different
   stages can interact and how these stages compare to intrinsic quality to
   properly modulate breeding success. Using a structural equation
   modelling approach, we investigated drivers of breeding success
   (migration cycle, individual quality, breeding conditions) in hoopoes
   Upupa epops, a long-distant migrant. Our causal framework explained 75\%
   of the variation in breeding success. The effect of the migration
   schedule was negligible, whereas the previous breeding attempt strongly
   influenced current breeding success. We suggest that the interplay of
   individual quality and environmental conditions during both previous and
   current breeding season may be more important drivers of breeding
   success than migration schedules, even in a long-distance migrant. We
   conclude that structural equation modeling is a promising tool to
   investigate causal relationships. Applied to hoopoes, we demonstrated
   that current breeding success is strongly linked to previous breeding
   success. Complementary analysis integrating weather and climate
   conditions during migration and the breeding season may provide a deeper
   and wider overview of the annual cycle of hoopoes and additional
   insights into the existence of carry-over effects in breeding success.}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{1-5}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Rivers are spatially organised into hierarchic dendritic networks.
   This unique physical structure and the associated directionality of
   physical flows set them apart from most other environments by regulating
   the dispersal of resident biota and therefore the distribution of
   biodiversity.
   2. The aim of this special issue is to highlight the importance of the
   river network on structuring biodiversity, particularly through
   metacommunity dynamics and associated dispersal processes.
   3. The issue covers a wide range of topics, including disease spread,
   nutrient uptake, trophic dynamics, effects of anthropogenic stressors
   and the joint roles of dispersal and environmental filtering.
   Contributions employ a broad range of approaches, including field and
   laboratory experiments, modelling, population genetics and conceptual
   synthesis.
   4. Although these studies represent just a sample of the research that
   is being performed on biodiversity and metacommunity dynamics in river
   networks, several important findings have emerged; a common theme being
   that the structure of the network and spatial dynamics clearly influence
   the dynamics of populations and communities, and their functions. By
   taking a broad taxonomic focus (from diatoms and protists to fish), and
   spanning a large geographic gradient (from the tropics to the
   subarctic), this special issue provides a broad look at the dynamics
   that occur in river networks relating to their unique makeup. We hope
   that this selection of studies spurs additional research on these
   interesting, globally important, yet severely threatened ecological
   systems.}},

Title = {{RUNOFF GENERATION IN A PRE-ALPINE CATCHMENT: A DISCUSSION BETWEEN A
   TRACER AND A SHALLOW GROUNDWATER HYDROLOGIST}},
Journal = {{CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{429-452}},
Abstract = {{Runoff generation mechanisms vary between catchments and despite decades
   of research in many catchments, these mechanisms are still not fully
   understood. In this paper, runoff generation mechanisms in the steep
   pre-alpine catchments in the Alptal, Switzerland, are discussed. These
   fast responding catchments are characterized by low permeability soils
   on top of flysch bedrock. In combination with the high and frequent
   precipitation, this results in predominantly wet conditions. In many
   areas, the water table is close to the surface. We review the main
   results of recent (2009-2016) studies in these catchments that used
   isotope, stream chemistry and hydrometric data. These field studies
   focused on the spatial and temporal patterns in groundwater levels,
   spatial patterns in the isotopic composition and chemistry of streamflow
   during baseflow conditions, as well as the responses of streamflow and
   its isotopic composition during rainfall events. The combined results of
   these studies highlight the establishment of connectivity of areas with
   different topographic positions and areas with a different land use
   during rainfall events. They also show the importance of flow in higher
   conductivity near surface soil layers for runoff generation, as well as
   the frequent occurrence of surface runoff. Spatial differences in
   groundwater dynamics are related to topography. Streamflow responses are
   mainly affected by the rainfall characteristics; differences in
   streamflow and hydrochemistry between catchments with different portions
   of forest, meadows and wetlands, were relatively small. However,
   variations in the chemistry of baseflow along stream reaches within a
   catchment were considerable. Above all, these studies highlight the
   value of combining data on spatial patterns of groundwater levels and
   stream chemistry with long term data on streamflow to derive a more
   complete picture of the dominant runoff generation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Species extinctions from local communities negatively affect ecosystem
   functioning. Ecological mechanisms underlying these impacts are well
   studied, but the role of evolutionary processes is rarely assessed.
   Using a long-term field experiment, we tested whether natural selection
   in plant communities increased biodiversity effects on productivity. We
   re-assembled communities with 8-year co-selection history adjacent to
   communities with identical species composition but no history of
   co-selection ({''}naive communities'). Monocultures, and in particular
   mixtures of two to four co-selected species, were more productive than
   their corresponding naive communities over 4years in soils with or
   without co-selected microbial communities. At the highest diversity
   level of eight plant species, no such differences were observed. Our
   findings suggest that plant community evolution can lead to rapid
   increases in ecosystem functioning at low diversity but may take longer
   at high diversity. This effect was not modified by treatments simulating
   co-evolutionary processes between plants and soil organisms.}},

   hierarchical organisation. Using field walks and interviews with
   consultants, we elicited 156 ethnoecological landscape categories, 60 of
   which related to vegetation types. However, sorting exercises with
   landscape photographs revealed that vegetation was not a guiding
   organisation principle. Takana consultants organised ethnoecological
   landscape categories into geographical regions that contained different
   landscape features, including vegetation units, topographical or
   hydrological features. Comparing the documented ethnoecological
   landscape categorisation with a published scientific botanical
   classification of vegetation units, we observed some important

Title = {{Combining human acceptance and habitat suitability in a unified
   socio-ecological suitability model: a case study of the wolf in
   Switzerland}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Habitat suitability models (HSMs) are commonly used in conservation
   practise to assess the potential of an area to be occupied and
   colonised. A major limitation of these models, however, is the omission
   of spatially explicit understanding of human acceptance towards the
   focal species. As wildlife is more and more subject to human-dominated
   landscapes, ignoring the sociological component will result in
   misrepresentation of the observed processes and inappropriate
   management.
   2. We distributed 10000 questionnaires across Switzerland and identified
   key socio-demographical factors correlated with human acceptance of the
   wolf. We then created a spatially explicit acceptance model based on
   geo-referenced socio-demographical, social and geographical information.
   Finally, we combined our acceptance model with a HSM to obtain a unified
   socio-ecological suitability model, which included human and ecological
   components.
   3. We showed that the key factors associated with human acceptance were
   perception of how harmful the wolf is, interest in wolf-related issues,
   need for livestock protection, and fear of the wolf. Perceived
   harmfulness was in turn correlated with direct and indirect experience
   with the wolf, and level of education.
   4. Our acceptance map predicted decreasing acceptance with increasing
   altitude of residency and proximity to locations of confirmed wolf
   presence. This resulted in the overall opposition to the wolf for the
   Alpine region, albeit substantial regional differences.
   5. We found little spatial overlap (6\% of Switzerland) between areas
   where the wolf was accepted and areas of suitable habitat. These areas
   of socio-ecological suitability were concentrated in the Jura Mountains
   and in the eastern and southern Alps, and were absent in the western and
   central Alps. Particularly in the Jura region, which is yet to be
   colonised, management of human acceptance will be a crucial conservation
   target.
   6. Synthesis and applications. We developed an integrative,
   socio-ecological approach that allowed us to accurately reproduce recent
   wolf recolonisation. We anticipate our framework to be a powerful tool
   to reliably evaluate overall suitable habitats and predict short to
   medium-term range expansion for species whose distribution is also
   dependent on human attitudes. Because our approach is sensitive to both
   the ecological and human component, it is ideally suited to identify key
   regions where proactive and targeted socio-ecological management plans
   are needed.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background In contrast to most animals, plants have an indeterminate
   body plan, which allows them to add new body parts during their
   lifetime. A plant's realized modular construction is the result of
   exogenous constraints and endogenous processes. This review focuses on
   endogenous processes that shape plant architectures and their evolution.
   Scope The phylogenetic distribution of plant growth forms across the
   phylogeny implies that body architectures have originated and been lost
   repeatedly, being shaped by a limited set of genetic pathways. We (1)
   synthesize concepts of plant architecture, so far captured in 23 models;
   (2) extend them to the fossil record; (3) summarize what is known about
   their developmental genetics; (4) use a phylogenetic approach in several
   groups to infer how plant architecture has changed and by which
   intermediate steps; and (5) discuss which macroecological factors may
   constrain the geographic and ecological distribution of plant
   architectures.
   Conclusions Dichotomously branching Paleozoic plants already encompassed
   a considerable diversity of growth forms, here captured in 12 new
   architectural models. Plotting the frequency of branching types through
   time based on an analysis of 58 927 land plant fossils revealed a
   decrease in dichotomous branching throughout the Devonian and
   Carboniferous, mirrored by an increase in other branching types
   including axillary branching. We suggest that the evolution of seed
   plant megaphyllous leaves enabling axillary branching contributed to the
   demise of dichotomous architectures. The developmental-genetic bases for
   key architectural traits underlying sympodial vs. monopodial branching,
   rhythmic vs. continuous growth, and axillary branching and its
   localization are becoming well understood, while the molecular basis of
   dichotomous branching and plagiotropy remains elusive. Three
   phylogenetic case studies of architecture evolution in conifers, Aloe
   and monocaulous arborescent vascular plants reveal relationships between
   architectural models and show that some are labile in given groups,
   whereas others are widely conserved, apparently shaped by ecological
   factors, such as intercepted sunlight, temperature, humidity and
   seasonality.}},

Abstract = {{Bialaphos resistance (BAR) and phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT)
   genes, which convey resistance to the broad-spectrum herbicide
   phosphinothricin (also known as glufosinate) via N-acetylation, have
   been globally used in basic plant research and genetically engineered
   crops(1-4). Although early in vitro enzyme assays showed that
   recombinant BAR and PAT exhibit substrate preference toward
   phosphinothricin over the 20 proteinogenic amino acids(1), indirect
   effects of BAR-containing transgenes in planta, including modified amino
   acid levels, have been seen but without the identification of their
   direct causes(5,6). Combining metabolomics, plant genetics and
   biochemical approaches, we show that transgenic BAR indeed converts two
   plant endogenous amino acids, aminoadipate and tryptophan, to their
   respective N-acetylated products in several plant species. We report the
   crystal structures of BAR, and further delineate structural basis for
   its substrate selectivity and catalytic mechanism. Through
   structure-guided protein engineering, we generated several BAR variants
   that display significantly reduced nonspecific activities compared with
   its wild-type counterpart in vivo. The transgenic expression of enzymes
   can result in unintended off-target metabolism arising from enzyme
   promiscuity. Understanding such phenomena at the mechanistic level can
   facilitate the design of maximally insulated systems featuring
   heterologously expressed enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Tropical elevation gradients are natural laboratories to assess how
   changing climate can influence tropical forests. However, there is a
   need for theory and integrated data collection to scale from traits to
   ecosystems. We assess predictions of a novel trait-based scaling theory,
   including whether observed shifts in forest traits across a broad
   tropical temperature gradient are consistent with local phenotypic
   optima and adaptive compensation for temperature.
   Location: An elevation gradient spanning 3,300 m and consisting of
   thousands of tropical tree trait measures taken from 16 1-ha tropical
   forest plots in southern Peru, where gross and net primary productivity
   (GPP and NPP) were measured.
   Time period: April to November 2013.
   Major taxa studied: Plants; tropical trees.
   Methods: We developed theory to scale from traits to communities and
   ecosystems and tested several predictions. We assessed the covariation
   between climate, traits, biomass and GPP and NPP. We measured multiple
   traits linked to variation in tree growth and assessed their frequency
   distributions within and across the elevation gradient. We paired these
   trait measures across individuals within 16 forests with simultaneous
   measures of ecosystem net and gross primary productivity.
   Results: Consistent with theory, variation in forest NPP and GPP
   primarily scaled with forest biomass, but the secondary effect of
   temperature on productivity was much less than expected. This weak
   temperature dependence appears to reflect directional shifts in several
   mean community traits that underlie tree growth with decreases in site
   temperature.
   Main conclusions: The observed shift in traits of trees that dominate in
   more cold environments is consistent with an `adaptive/acclimatory'
   compensation for the kinetic effects of temperature on leaf
   photosynthesis and tree growth. Forest trait distributions across the
   gradient showed overly peaked and skewed distributions, consistent with
   the importance of local filtering of optimal growth traits and recent
   shifts in species composition and dominance attributable to warming from
   climate change. Trait-based scaling theory provides a basis to predict
   how shifts in climate have and will influence the trait composition and
   ecosystem functioning of tropical forests.}},

Pages = {{495-507}},

Abstract = {{Market-based solutions to climate change are widely advocated by
   financial actors and policy makers in order to foster a smooth
   transition to a low-carbon economy. A first important limiting factor to
   this approach is widely recognized to be the imperfect information on
   investors' portfolios' exposure to climate-related risks. While better
   disclosure of climate-relevant information is often recommended as a
   remedy, the current lack of concise and comparable measures of
   portfolios' exposure to climate risk fails to provide major investors
   with the full incentives to reallocate their portfolios. A second
   limiting factor arises from the fact that in the context of the
   low-carbon transition, it is not clear how to measure the market share
   of participants because many economic sectors produce greenhouse gases
   (GHG) emissions or induce them along the supply chain. The lack of
   common and concise measures of the relevant market share hampers the
   ability of policy makers to ensure fair competition policies and the
   ability of major investors to assess the effects of their own and their
   competitors' portfolio reallocation. To address these two gaps, we
   propose two novel and complementary indices: (i) the ``GHG exposure,{''}
   capturing the exposure of single investors' portfolios to climate
   transition risks, and (ii) ``GHG holding,{''} capturing the market share
   of each financial actor weighted by its contribution to GHG emissions.
   We illustrate the use of the indices on a dataset of portfolios of
   equity holdings and loans in the Euro-Area, and we discuss the policy
   implications for the low-carbon transition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the role of paradoxes in research and proposes
   strategies of engaging with them. For this purpose, it analyses the ways
   in which six paradoxes are constitutive of sports mega-events such as
   the Olympic Games: the universalism paradox, the compliance paradox, the
   winner's paradox, the participation paradox, the uniqueness paradox and
   the passion paradox. It then develops three strategies of how
   researchers and practitioners can approach paradox. The first,
   exploration, examines the consequences and effects of the ambiguity of
   paradoxes. The second, differentiation, enquires into the
   spatio-temporal and social make-up of paradoxes. The third, reframing,
   recasts paradoxes by shifting theoretical perspectives. Instead of
   pressing to resolve paradoxes, researchers and practitioners alike
   should make productive use of their ambiguity. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Abstract = {{Does the progress in understanding evolutionary theory depend on the
   species that is doing the investigation? This question is difficult to
   answer scientifically, as we are dealing with an n = 1 scenario: every
   individual who has ever written about evolution is a human being. I will
   discuss, first, whether we get the correct answer to questions if we
   begin with ourselves and expand outwards, and second, whether we might
   fail to ask all the interesting questions unless we combat our
   tendencies to favour taxa that are close to us. As a whole, the human
   tendency to understand general biological phenomena via ` putting
   oneself in another organism's shoes' has upsides and downsides. As an
   upside, our intuitive ability to rethink strategies if the situation
   changes can lead to ready generation of adaptive hypotheses. Downsides
   occur if we trust this intuition too much, and particular danger zones
   exist for traits where humans are an unusual species. I argue that the
   levels of selection debate might have proceeded differently if human
   cooperation patterns were not so unique, as this brings about unique
   challenges in biology teaching; and that theoretical insights regarding
   inbreeding avoidance versus tolerance could have spread faster if we
   were not extrapolating our emotional reactions to incest
   disproportionately depending on whether we study animals or plants. I
   also discuss patterns such as taxonomic chauvinism, i.e. less attention
   being paid to species that differ more from human-like life histories.
   Textbooks on evolution reinforce such biases insofar as they present, as
   a default case, systems that resemble ours in terms of life cycles and
   other features (e.g. gonochorism). Additionally, societal norms may have
   led to incorrect null hypotheses such as females not mating multiply.}},

Title = {{Plant-mediated RNAi silences midgut-expressed genes in congeneric
   lepidopteran insects in nature}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Plant-mediated RNAi (PMRi) silencing of insect genes has
   enormous potential for crop protection, but whether it works robustly
   under field conditions, particularly with lepidopteran pests, remains
   controversial. Wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata and cultivated tobacco
   (N. tabacum) (Solanaceae) is attacked by two closely related specialist
   herbivores Manduca sexta and M. quinquemaculata (Lepidoptera,
   Sphingidae). When M. sexta larvae attack transgenic N. attenuata plants
   expressing double-stranded RNA(dsRNA) targeting M. sexta's
   midgut-expressed genes, the nicotine-ingestion induced cytochrome P450
   monooxygenase (invert repeat (ir)CYP6B46-plants) and the
   lyciumoside-IV-ingestion induced beta-glucosidase1 (irBG1-plants), these
   larval genes which are important for the larvae's response to ingested
   host toxins, are strongly silenced.
   Results: Here we show that the PMRi procedure also silences the
   homologous genes in native M. quinquemaculata larvae feeding on
   irCYP6B46 and irBG1-transgenic N. attenuata plants in nature. The PMRi
   lines shared 98 and 96\% sequence similarity with M. quinquemaculata
   homologous coding sequences, and CYP6B46 and BG1 transcripts were
   reduced by ca. 90 and 80\%, without reducing the transcripts of the
   larvae's most similar, potential off-target genes.
   Conclusions: We conclude that the PMRi procedure can robustly and
   specifically silence genes in native congeneric insects that share
   sufficient sequence similarity and with the careful selection of
   targets, might protect crops from attack by congeneric-groups of insect
   pests.}},

Volume = {{71}},

Pages = {{2548-2561}},

Abstract = {{The enormous species richness in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of
   Southern Africa is the result of numerous radiations, but the temporal
   progression and possible mechanisms of these radiations are still poorly
   understood. Here, we explore the macroevolutionary dynamics of the
   Restionaceae, which include 340 species that are found in all vegetation
   types in the Cape flora and are ecologically dominant in fynbos. Using
   an almost complete (i.e., 98\%) species-level time calibrated phylogeny
   and models of diversification dynamics, we show that species
   diversification is constant through the Cenozoic, with no evidence of an
   acceleration with the onset of the modern winter-wet climate, or a
   recent density-dependent slowdown. Contrary to expectation, species
   inhabiting the oldest (montane) and most extensive (drylands) habitats
   did not undergo higher diversification rates than species in the younger
   (lowlands) and more restricted (wetland) habitats. We show that the rate
   of habitat transitions is more closely related to the speciation rate
   than to time, and that more than a quarter of all speciation events are
   associated with habitat transitions. This suggests that the unbounded
   Restionaceae diversification resulted from numerous, parallel, habitat
   shifts, rather than persistence in a habitat stimulating speciation. We
   speculate that this could be one of the mechanisms resulting in the
   hyperdiverse Cape flora.}},

Title = {{Life history tactics shape amphibians' demographic responses to the

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Over the last three decades, climate abnormalities have been reported to
   be involved in biodiversity decline by affecting population dynamics. A
   growing number of studies have shown that the North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO) influences the demographic parameters of a wide range of plant and
   animal taxa in different ways. Life history theory could help to
   understand these different demographic responses to the NAO. Indeed,
   theory states that the impact of weather variation on a species'
   demographic traits should depend on its position along the fast-slow
   continuum. In particular, it is expected that NAO would have a higher
   impact on recruitment than on adult survival in slow species, while the
   opposite pattern is expected occur in fast species. To test these
   predictions, we used long-term capture-recapture datasets (more than
   15,000 individuals marked from 1965 to 2015) on different surveyed
   populations of three amphibian species in Western Europe: Triturus
   cristatus, Bombina variegata, and Salamandra salamandra. Despite
   substantial intraspecific variation, our study revealed that these three
   species differ in their position on a slow-fast gradient of pace of
   life. Our results also suggest that the differences in life history
   tactics influence amphibian responses to NAO fluctuations: Adult
   survival was most affected by the NAO in the species with the fastest
   pace of life (T.cristatus), whereas recruitment was most impacted in
   species with a slower pace of life (B.variegata and S.salamandra). In
   the context of climate change, our findings suggest that the capacity of
   organisms to deal with future changes in NAO values could be closely
   linked to their position on the fast-slow continuum.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal is considered to be a species-specific trait, but
   intraspecific variation can be high. However, when and how this complex
   trait starts to differentiate during the divergence of species/lineages
   is unknown. Here, we studied the differentiation of movement behaviour
   in a large salamander population (Salamandra salamandra), in which
   individual adaptations to different habitat conditions drive the genetic
   divergence of this population into two subpopulations. In this system,
   salamanders have adapted to the deposition and development of their
   larvae in ephemeral ponds vs. small first-order streams. In general, the
   pond habitat is characterized as a spatially and temporally highly
   unpredictable habitat, while streams provide more stable and predictable
   conditions for the development of larvae. We analysed the fine-scale
   genetic distribution of larvae, and explored whether the adaptation to
   different larval habitat conditions has in turn also affected dispersal
   strategies and home range size of adult salamanders. Based on the
   genetic assignment of adult individuals to their respective larval
   habitat type, we show that pond-adapted salamanders occupied larger home
   ranges, displayed long-distance dispersal and had a higher variability
   of movement types than the stream-adapted individuals. We argue that the
   differentiation of phenotypically plastic traits such as dispersal and
   movement characteristics can be a crucial component in the course of
   adaptation to new habitat conditions, thereby promoting the genetic
   divergence of populations.}},

Title = {{When earwig mothers do not care to share: Parent-offspring competition
   and the evolution of family life}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{2098-2107}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Kin competition often reduces -and sometimes entirely negates -the
   benefits of cooperation among family members. Surprisingly, the impact
   of kin competition on the fitness effects of family life only received
   close scrutiny in studies on sibling rivalry, whereas the possibility of
   parent-offspring competition has attracted much less -attention. As a
   consequence, it remains unclear whether and how parent-offspring
   competition could have affected the early evolution of parental care and
   family life.
   2. Here, we examined the occurrence and consequences of parent-offspring
   competition over food access in the European earwig Forficula
   auricularia, an insect with facultative family life reminiscent of an
   ancestral state. Specifically, we (1) raised earwig offspring under food
   limitation either together with or without their mother, and (2) tested
   whether and how the -potentially competitive -weight gains of mothers
   and offspring during family life affected the offsprings' survival rate
   and morphology, and the future reproductive investment of their mother.
   3. In line with the occurrence of parent-offspring competition, we
   showed that high maternal weight gains during family life reduced the
   survival prospects of maternally tended offspring, while they increased
   the mothers' investment into the production of a second clutch (but not
   the body size of the surviving offspring). Conversely, high offspring
   weight gains generally increased the offsprings' survival, but did so to
   a larger extent when they were together with their mother. Intriguingly,
   mothers that had exhibited a low initial weight showed especially high
   weight gains.
   4. Overall, our results demonstrate that maternal presence under food
   restriction triggered a local competition between mothers and their
   offspring. This competition limited offspring survival, but allowed
   mothers to increase their investment into future reproduction and/ or to
   maintain their current body condition. On a general level, our findings
   reveal that parent-offspring competition can counteract the benefits of
   (facultative) parental care, and may thus impede the evolution of family
   life in resource-poor environments.}},

Abstract = {{Prestonia R. Br. (apocynoids, Echiteae) comprises ca. 58 species, which
   are lianas with eglandular leaves, axillary or terminal cymose
   inflorescences, sepals with a single colleter, flowers usually with an
   annular corona around the mouth and/ or free corona lobes, follicular
   fruits, and truncate seeds that are comose at themicropylar end. Three
   infrageneric classifications have been proposed in the last 110 years,
   all of them based only on morphological characters and none of which
   have been tested with molecular data. In the present study, based on the
   analyses of 62 nuclear and 258 chloroplast sequences from 65 species, we
   test the monophyly of Prestonia as well as the infrageneric
   classifications proposed for the genus. Prestonia was shown to
   bemonophyletic, but the infrageneric sections proposed by Schumann,
   Woodson, and Pichon are all non-monophyletic. We propose a new
   infrageneric classification for Prestonia, recognizing six sections:
   Coalitae Woodson, Denticulatae J. F. Morales, M. E. Endress \& Liede,
   Exsertae J. F. Morales, M. E. Endress \& Liede, Haemadictyon (Lindl.)
   Baill., Mollis J. F. Morales, M. E. Endress \& Liede, and Prestonia. A
   key to the sections is provided. Prestonia pickelii Markgr. is removed
   fromthe synonymy of P. quinquangularis (Jacq.) Spreng. and resurrected
   as an accepted species. We provide a brief overview of the prolific
   groundbreaking work of Robert E. Woodson and Marcel Pichon in the
   Apocynaceae and Prestonia, and respectfully pay homage to their
   invaluable contributions to our knowledge of the family.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Are the disjunct distributions of ancient lineages on continents in
   the Southern Hemisphere determined by vicariance following the Gondwanan
   tectonic breakup or recent long-distance dispersal? We traced the
   historical biogeography of the tree fern family Dicksoniaceae (145 Ma),
   which has a typical Gondwanan distribution, to test for vicariance or
   recent long-distance dispersal.
   Location: Subtropical, tropical and temperate forests of the Southern
   Hemisphere.
   Methods: We performed a molecular phylogenetic study of the family based
   on four chloroplast markers using Bayesian and maximum likelihood
   inference. Spore fossils served to calibrate the dating of the phylogeny
   using BEAST. The historical biogeography of the family was traced via an
   ancestral area reconstruction using a maximum likelihood approach.
   Results: We corroborated the genus Dicksonia (widespread) as sister to
   Lophosoria (Neotropical), with Calochlaena (Palaeotropical) as sister to
   both. The phylogenetic splits between the genera predate the break-up of
   Gondwana. Lophosoria is currently restricted to America but fossils
   document extinct populations in Australia, Tasmania and Antarctica.
   Within Dicksonia, we found three clades which separated 55-25 Ma: one
   including species from New Caledonia, New Zealand and Fiji; another
   containing species from the Neotropics as well as southern Australia and
   New Zealand; and one with species from northern Australia to the
   Philippines and Sumatra. Vicariance and ancient long-distance dispersal
   can equally explain the occurrence of these three clades on different
   tectonic units of Gondwana. Other geographical disjunctions, for
   example, between Australia and Malesia, are more recent (15-3 Ma) and
   inferred to be the result of long-distance dispersal. The combination of
   fossil evidence and island endemics whose ages predate the ages of the
   islands point to substantial extinction in the genus.
   Main conclusions: The biogeographical history of the family
   Dicksoniaceae, and especially of Dicksonia itself, appears to have
   involved a much more dynamic interplay of vicariance, dispersal and
   extinction than inferred from current distributions alone. Dicksonia is
   one of the few biogeographical Gondwanan floristic elements whose
   current distribution can at least partly be linked to plate tectonic
   events.}},

Abstract = {{The European Alps are a geomorphologically active region and experience
   a number of gravity-driven hillslope processes. Soil and landscape
   formation in the Alps has consequently undergone several minor and major
   traceable changes of developmental trajectories during the Holocene.
   Soil development is hypothesised to be often non-linear with time and
   characterised by stages of progressive and regressive evolution caused
   by up building (formation, profile deepening) and erosion (profile
   shallowing). Several cold and warm climate phases are identified during
   the Holocene but it is largely unknown which effects these might have
   had on slope processes. By using datable moraines (Be-10) and mires
   (C-14), we have constructed a temporal framework for these processes.
   Using the geochemical imprint of mires in the Alpine setting of the
   Goschener-valley of the Central Swiss Alps, we reconstructed general
   (mostly erosional) landscape processes for the last ca. 10 ka. As this
   is the type locality for the Goschener cold phase, we assumed that this
   phase (Goschener cold phase I and II similar to 1.5 and similar to 2.5
   ka BP) should have left easily recognizable traits. After deglaciation
   (11-12 ka BP), soil evolution was progressive. Beginning around 8 ka BP,
   we detect a distinct increase in erosion here, together with a
   vegetation change (towards tundra vegetation) and the highest measured
   rates of carbon sequestration. Other phases of high geomorphic activity
   were recognised ca. 5-6 ka BP, 4 ka BP and, to a lesser extent, 1-3 ka
   ago. The cold phase at 5-6 ka BP corresponds to a less distinct change
   in vegetation and lessened erosion. Human impact is increasingly obvious
   since about 2.4 ka BP which overlaps with the Goschener cold phase.
   Nonetheless, erosion processes were not extraordinarily high during this
   period and a climate effect cannot be distinguished. We detect evidence
   of increasing human disturbance (regressive soil evolution) for about
   the last 1 ka. We also detect an increase in dust flux during the last
   ca. 4-5 ka, presumably due to the landscape change(s) in the Sahara
   during this time.}},

Title = {{Smell or vision? The use of different sensory modalities in predator
   discrimination}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that animals should adjust their escape responses to the
   perceived predation risk. The information animals obtain about potential
   predation risk may differ qualitatively depending on the sensory
   modality by which a cue is perceived. For instance, olfactory cues may
   reveal better information about the presence or absence of threats,
   whereas visual information can reliably transmit the position and
   potential attack distance of a predator. While this suggests a
   differential use of information perceived through the two sensory
   channels, the relative importance of visual vs. olfactory cues when
   distinguishing between different predation threats is still poorly
   understood. Therefore, we exposed individuals of the cooperatively
   breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher to a standardized threat
   stimulus combined with either predator or non-predator cues presented
   either visually or chemically. We predicted that flight responses
   towards a threat stimulus are more pronounced if cues of dangerous
   rather than harmless heterospecifics are presented and that N. pulcher,
   being an aquatic species, relies more on olfaction when discriminating
   between dangerous and harmless heterospecifics. N. pulcher responded
   faster to the threat stimulus, reached a refuge faster and entered a
   refuge more likely when predator cues were perceived. Unexpectedly, the
   sensory modality used to perceive the cues did not affect the escape
   response or the duration of the recovery phase. This suggests that N.
   pulcher are able to discriminate heterospecific cues with similar acuity
   when using vision or olfaction. We discuss that this ability may be
   advantageous in aquatic environments where the visibility conditions
   strongly vary over time.
   Significance statement
   The ability to rapidly discriminate between dangerous predators and
   harmless heterospecifics is crucial for the survival of prey animals. In
   seasonally fluctuating environment, sensory conditions may change over
   the year and may make the use of multiple sensory modalities for
   heterospecific discrimination highly beneficial. Here we compared the
   efficacy of visual and olfactory senses in the discrimination ability of
   the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. We presented
   individual fish with visual or olfactory cues of predators or harmless
   heterospecifics and recorded their flight response. When exposed to
   predator cues, individuals responded faster, reached a refuge faster and
   were more likely to enter the refuge. Unexpectedly, the olfactory and
   visual senses seemed to be equally efficient in this discrimination
   task, suggesting that seasonal variation of water conditions experienced
   by N. pulcher may necessitate the use of multiple sensory channels for
   the same task.}},

Abstract = {{Human related mortality is a major threat for large carnivores all over
   the world and there is increasing evidence that large predators respond
   to human related risks in a similar way as prey respond to predation
   risk. This insight recently led to the conceptual development of a
   landscape of coexistence that can be used to identify areas which can
   sustain large predator populations in human dominated landscapes. In
   this study we applied the landscape of coexistence concept to a large
   predator in Europe. We investigated to what extent Eurasian lynx Lynx
   lynx habitat selection is affected by human disturbance in a human
   dominated landscape. More specifically, we were interested in the
   existence of a tradeoff between the availability of roe deer, one of
   their main prey and avoidance of human disturbance and how this affects
   the spatio-temporal space use patterns of lynx. We found that lynx face
   a tradeoff between high prey availability and avoidance of human
   disturbance and that they respond to this by using areas of high prey
   availability (but also high human disturbance) during the night when
   human activity is low. Furthermore our analysis showed that lynx
   increase their travelling speed and remain more in cover when they are
   close to areas of high human disturbance. Despite clear behavioral
   adjustments in response to human presence, prey availability still
   proved to be the most important predictor of lynx occurrence at small
   spatial scale, whereas human disturbance was considerably less
   important. The results of our study demonstrate how spatio-temporal
   adaptations in habitat selection enable large carnivores to persist in
   human dominated landscapes and demonstrate the usefulness of the concept
   of a landscape of coexistence to develop adaptive management plans for
   endangered populations of large carnivores.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer new opportunities for wildlife
   monitoring, with several advantages over traditional field-based
   methods. They have readily been used to count birds, marine mammals and
   large herbivores in different environments, tasks which are routinely
   performed through manual counting in large collections of images. In
   this paper, we propose a semi-automatic system able to detect large
   mammals in semi-arid Savanna. It relies on an animal -detection system
   based on machine learning, trained with crowd-sourced annotations
   provided by volunteers who manually interpreted sub-decimeter resolution
   color images. The system achieves a high recall rate and a human
   operator can then eliminate false detections with limited effort. Our
   system provides good perspectives for the development of data-driven
   management practices in wildlife conservation. It shows that the
   detection of large mammals in semi-arid Savanna can be approached by
   processing data provided by standard RGB cameras mounted on affordable

Journal = {{PLANT AND SOIL}},

Abstract = {{Leaf litter decomposition is closely linked to nutrient cycling and
   driven by environmental conditions, species-specific leaf chemistry, and
   here in particular by polyphenols composition. However, not much
   attention has been paid on the decomposition of polyphenols themselves.
   We hypothesized that phenolics and tannin decomposition rates are
   species-specific and positively affected by litter species richness.
   Leaf litter of three Chinese tree species was exposed to field
   decomposition conditions, aggregated in mixtures of different species
   richness (1-, 2-, 3-species mixtures). We sampled litter five times over
   the course of 171 days, calculated species-specific total phenolics and
   total protein precipitable tannin decomposition rates, assessed changes
   in polyphenol composition using HPLC, and tentatively identified
   compounds by LC-ESI-MS/MS.
   Leaf litter richness effects on phenolics and tannin decomposition rates
   were positive, except for Sapindus-specific tannins, and differed
   between leaf litter species. Decomposition duration changed polyphenol
   compositions, and significantly interacted with leaf litter species
   richness with increasing effects of litter richness with time.
   Litter diversity effects on polyphenol decomposition are crucial for

Abstract = {{As a result of global climate change the incidence of drought conditions
   in Europe is predicted to increase in the future, which also influences
   plant resistance. Lipids are important plant constituents that protect
   plants against drought stress and contribute to the intermediate stable
   carbon (C) pool in soil. However, the extent to which drought influences
   lipid cycling in the plant-soil system is unknown and, therefore, it
   remains questionable how the ecosystem recovers after drought. We
   focused on plant and soil samples from two different plant communities
   (temperate grassland and heathland) that had been exposed to 5 years of
   4.5-6.0 weeks repeated annual drought. They were sampled one year after
   the last drought to check the recovery of the plant-soil system. Samples
   were analyzed for their bulk C, stable C and nitrogen (N) isotope (C-13,
   N-15) and lipid composition. Contrary to our expectation, no strong
   influence of five years of repeated annual drought was observed for
   above-ground biomass, roots and soils in the model ecosystems with
   respect to elemental (C and N concentrations, C : N ratio) bulk isotope
   (C-13, N-15) composition and the total extractable lipid concentration.
   Thus, plants did not sustain a significant change in their C and lipid
   concentration as well as their composition after five years of repeated
   annual drought. This might be related to the comparatively short drought
   period related to the overall growth season and provides evidence for
   recovery of the C and lipid dynamics in temperate grassland and
   heathland model ecosystems exposed to annual drought.}},

Title = {{Legume Shrubs Are More Nitrogen-Homeostatic than Non-legume Shrubs}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Legumes are characterized as keeping stable nutrient supply under
   nutrient-limited conditions. However, few studies examined the legumes'
   stoichiometric advantages over other plants across various taxa in
   natural ecosystems. We explored differences in nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P) stoichiometry of different tissue types (leaf, stern, and
   root) between N-2-fixing legume shrubs and non-N-2-fixing shrubs from
   299 broadleaved deciduous shrubland sites in northern China. After
   excluding effects of taxonomy and environmental variables, these two
   functional groups differed considerably in nutrient regulation. N
   concentrations and N:P ratios were higher in legume shrubs than in non
   N-2-fixing shrubs. N concentrations were positively correlated between
   the plants and soil for non-N-2-fixing shrubs, but not for legume
   shrubs, indicating a stronger stoichiometric homeostasis in legume
   shrubs than in non-N-2-fixing shrubs. N concentrations were positively
   correlated among three tissue types for non-N-2-fixing shrubs, but not
   between leaves and non-leaf tissues for legume shrubs, demonstrating
   that N concentrations were more dependent among tissues for
   non-N-2-fixing shrubs than for legume shrubs. N and P concentrations
   were correlated within all tissues for both functional groups, but the
   regression slopes were flatter for legume shrubs than non-N-2-fixing
   shrubs, implying that legume shrubs were more P limited than
   non-N-2-fixing shrubs. These results address significant differences in
   stoichiometry between legume shrubs and non N-fixing shrubs, and
   indicate the influence of symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNP) on plant
   stoichiometry. Overall,N-2-fixing legume shrubs are higher and more
   stoichiometrically homeostatic in N concentrations. However, due to
   excess uptake of N, legumes may suffer from potential P limitation. With
   their N advantage, legume shrubs could be good nurse plants in
   restoration sites with degraded soil, but their P supply should be taken
   care of during management according to our results.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) has great potential in creating high
   resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). However, little is known
   about the properties of TLS derived DEMs covering several hectares in
   heterogeneous environments compared to conventional airborne laser
   scanning (ALS) based models and their influence on derived products. We
   investigated the accuracy of DEMs with different resolutions derived
   from TLS and high quality ALS on a study site with complex
   micro-topography covered by dense forest and ground vegetation. We
   further examined the effect of these DEMs on predicted topsoil pH using
   linear regression models built on terrain attributes. We show that at
   high resolutions (similar to 1 m), TLS based DEMs performed better than
   ALS DEMs, which directly translated into significantly better pH models,
   the best of which showing an R-2 of 0.62. The use of TLS therefore
   improves the quality of terrain attributes, which are the foundation for
   many ecological and hydrological applications. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The benefits and detriments of recombination for adaptive evolution have
   been studied both theoretically and experimentally, with conflicting
   predictions and observations. Most pertinent experiments examine
   recombination's effects in an unchanging environment and do not study
   its genomewide effects. Here, we evolved six replicate populations of
   either highly recombining R+ or lowly recombining R-E.coli strains in a
   changing environment, by introducing the novel nutrients L-arabinose or
   indole into the environment. The experiment's ancestral strains are not
   viable on these nutrients, but 130 generations of adaptive evolution
   were sufficient to render them viable. Recombination conferred a more
   pronounced advantage to populations adapting to indole. To study the
   genomic changes associated with this advantage, we sequenced the genomes
   of 384 clones isolated from selected replicates at the end of the
   experiment. These genomes harbour complex changes that range from point
   mutations to large-scale DNA amplifications. Among several candidate
   adaptive mutations, those in the tryptophanase regulator tnaC stand out,
   because the tna operon in which it resides has a known role in indole
   metabolism. One of the highly recombining populations also shows a
   significant excess of large-scale segmental DNA amplifications that
   include the tna operon. This lineage also shows a unique and potentially
   adaptive combination of point mutations and DNA amplifications that may
   have originated independently from one another, to be joined later by
   recombination. Our data illustrate that the advantages of recombination
   for adaptive evolution strongly depend on the environment and that they
   can be associated with complex genomic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Sex allocation theory predicts that females mated to attractive males
   produce more sons than females mated to unattractive males. However,
   previous tests of this hypothesis have obtained mixed results. We
   suggest that females differ in the traits they find attractive. To test
   this proposition, we assessed female zebra finches' preferences for
   males banded with red or green plastic leg bands and then tested the sex
   allocation pattern of females paired with preferred and non-preferred
   males. Although most females preferred red-banded males, 34\% of females
   consistently preferred green-banded males. The sex ratio at laying and
   hatching was not influenced by paternal preferred status. However, the
   fledging sex ratios differed between females paired with preferred and
   non-preferred males due to sex-biased chick mortality; sons of females
   paired with preferred males were born heavier and were more likely to
   survive than daughters. Our results indicate that female zebra finches
   show individual variation in their preferences for colour banded males,
   although females do not seem to adjust the offspring sex ratio in
   response to their mate's band colour. However, the differential
   post-hatch mortality suggests females may differentially allocate
   resources into male and female eggs according to their individual mate
   preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Speciation is typically accompanied by the formation of isolation
   barriers between lineages. Commonly, reproductive barriers are separated
   into pre- and post-zygotic mechanisms that can evolve with different
   speed. In this study, we measured the strength of different reproductive
   barriers in two closely related, sympatric orchids of the Ophrys
   insectifera group, namely Ophrys insectifera and Ophrys aymoninii to
   infer possible mechanisms of speciation. We quantified pre- and
   post-pollination barriers through observation of pollen flow, by
   performing artificial inter- and intraspecific crosses and analyzing
   scent bouquets. Additionally, we investigated differences in mycorrhizal
   fungi as a potential extrinsic factor of post-zygotic isolation. Our
   results show that floral isolation mediated by the attraction of
   different pollinators acts apparently as the sole reproductive barrier
   between the two orchid species, with later-acting intrinsic barriers
   seemingly absent. Also, the two orchids share most of their fungal
   mycorrhizal partners in sympatry, suggesting little or no importance of
   mycorrhizal symbiosis in reproductive isolation. Key traits underlying
   floral isolation were two alkenes and wax ester, present predominantly
   in the floral scent of O.aymoninii. These compounds, when applied to
   flowers of O.insectifera, triggered attraction and a copulation attempt
   of the bee pollinator of O.aymoninii and thus led to the (partial)
   breakdown of floral isolation. Based on our results, we suggest that
   adaptation to different pollinators, mediated by floral scent, underlies

Abstract = {{In many natural systems, the physical structure of the landscape
   dictates the flow of resources. Despite mounting evidence that
   communities' dynamics can be indirectly coupled by reciprocal among
   ecosystem resource flows, our understanding of how directional resource
   flows might indirectly link biological communities is limited. We here
   propose that differences in community structure upstream should lead to
   different downstream dynamics, even in the absence of dispersal of
   organisms. We report an experimental test of the effect of upstream
   community structure on downstream community dynamics in a simplified but
   highly controlled setting, using protist microcosms. We implemented
   directional flows of resources, without dispersal, from a standard
   resource pool into upstream communities of contrasting interaction
   structure and then to further downstream communities of either one or
   two trophic levels. Our results demonstrate that different types of
   species interactions in upstream habitats may lead to different
   population sizes and levels of biomass in these upstream habitats. This,
   in turn, leads to varying levels of detritus transfer (dead biomass) to
   the downstream communities, thus influencing their population densities
   and trophic interactions in predictable ways. Our results suggest that
   the structure of species interactions in directionally structured
   ecosystems can be a key mediator of alterations to downstream habitats.
   Alterations to upstream habitats can thus cascade down to downstream
   communities, even without dispersal.}},

Title = {{Beta diversity of herbivorous insects is coupled to high species and

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Aim Insect distribution patterns can result from historical contingency
   (biogeography and dispersal limitation), abiotic filtering and biotic
   factors (ecological interactions and evolutionary associations). Here,
   we analyse turnover of plant and insect herbivore community composition
   at multiple spatial scales to tease apart these influences. While
   positive associations between plant and insect turnover across broad
   spatial scales could arise through any of these influences, strong
   association at very local scales is only likely if insect distributions
   are determined primarily by biotic factors (i.e. host specificity).
   Location The Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa.
   Methods To characterize the relationship between spatial turnover in
   plant and insect composition in the CFR, communities of Restionaceae, a
   dominant family in the florally diverse CFR, and their associated
   herbivores were sampled using a spatially nested sampling design on
   three spatially separated mountain blocks with similar climates, thus
   controlling for broad abiotic influences. This allowed us to quantify
   insect and plant turnover, and their association, at multiple
   independent spatial scales. Redundancy analysis was used to determine
   the effects of plant on insect composition, controlling for geographical
   distance.
   Results Insect species turnover was significantly related to plant
   species and phylogenetic turnover at local, as well as broad, spatial
   scales, suggesting that insect distribution patterns are mainly
   structured by host specificity. Plant communities show near complete
   turnover at small spatial scales (i.e. communities situated 0.1-3km
   apart), with insects mirroring this pattern. Further, insect turnover
   increased significantly with increasing geographical separation (e.g.
   between mountains), suggesting an additional influence of
   biogeographical factors on insect distributions in the CFR. Measured
   environmental and plant structural components had no influence on insect
   composition.
   Main conclusions High insect beta diversity positively associated with
   plant turnover at local scales suggests insect herbivore diversity
   patterns in the CFR are primarily structured by plant distribution
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Rarer species are expected to show stronger geographic differentiation
   than more common species. However, if rare species hybridize with common
   species, differentiation may be quite similar between the two due to

   differentiation of plants of 21 natural populations of the more common
   Carex flava, 16 of the less common Carex viridula and 6 of their hybrids
   from 27 sites in three climatically different regions, Estonia, Lowland
   Switzerland and Highland Switzerland. Univariate ANOVA and multivariate
   principal component analysis of 14 morphological characters, describing
   both vegetative and reproductive characters, allowed to clearly
   distinguish C. flava from C. viridula. Carex viridula populations showed
   stronger regional variation than C. flava. Hybrids had both intermediate
   and transgressive characters in Switzerland and Estonia. On average,
   hybrids from Lowland Switzerland were more similar to Swiss C. flava
   than to C. viridula, while hybrids from Estonia were morphologically
   intermediate between plants of Estonian populations of the parental
   species. The results suggest that within-region genetic admixing between
   species has limited potential to lead to region-specific similarity
   between species, at least in our model system of the C. flava complex.
   We conclude that C. flava and C. viridula are clearly distinct species

   pronounced in the less common C. viridula than in C. flava.}},

Abstract = {{The Permian Triassic boundary (PTB) interval is known to document a
   major biodiversity crisis in the history of life. It is generally
   accepted that this crisis had a significant impact on marine
   invertebrates. The consequences for terrestrial ecosystems are still
   controversially discussed. Based on palynological analysis we present a
   high time resolution microfloral succession of the expanded Late Permian
   (Wuchiapingian- Early Triassic (Dienerian) section from Kap Stosch, East
   Greenland. The quantitative distribution of palynomorphs (range charts
   and relative abundance data) allows for the differentiation of six
   distinct palynofloral associations. Ammonoids and conodonts provide
   independent age control for these assemblages. The Wuchiapingian
   association I, documented from the Ravn4eld Formation, shows a typical
   Late Permian assemblage dominated by bisaccate and monosaccate pollen
   grains and Vittatina spp. It is separated from association II, present
   in the basal part of the Wordie Creek Formation, by an important hiatus.
   This association of Changhsingian or earliest Griesbachian age is
   characterised by the common occurrence of Ephedripites spp. and reduced
   abundance and diversity of Vittatina spp. Association III, dated as
   Griesbachian by the presence of ammonoids, is marked by high relative
   abundances of taeniate bisaccate pollen grains and high spore diversity.
   A distinct floral break occurs between the gymnosperm dominated Permian
   and Griesbachian floras and the lycopsid spore dominated Dienerian
   associations IV-VI. Ammonoid occurrences verify a Dienerian age for the
   latter associations. Association V is marked by the absence of
   non-taeniate bisaccate, striate monosaccate pollen grains, and Vittatina
   spp. Aratrisporites spp. a typical Triassic lycopsid spore occur
   consistently from this level onwards. Association VI is characterised by
   highest lycopsid spore abundances. Cluster analysis demonstrates that
   Griesbachian assemblages (associations II?-III) are similar to Permian
   ones and clearly differ from Dienerian assemblages confirming a major
   floral turnover near the Griesbachian Dienerian boundary. In contrast to
   the commonly advocated idea of a profound effect of the PTB crisis on
   terrestrial ecosystem, the present data set shows no major effect of the
   PTB event on floral diversity. Strikingly, considering species numbers
   alone, the major floral event at the Griesbachian-Dienerian boundary is
   also indistinct, but sticks out from abundance data, emphasising the
   necessity to consider both species ranges and abundances data to
   characterise terrestrial ecosystem dynamics in critical time intervals.
   Generally we note a gradual disappearance of Permian floral elements
   such as Vittatina spp., Weylandites spp. or Florinites spp. and a
   gradual appearance and diversification of typical Triassic spores such
   Aratrisporites spp. and Densoisporites nejburgii.}},

Abstract = {{Attentional engagement with climate change is an important precondition
   for intentional climate friendly behavior. However, not much is known
   about the determinants of an individuals' implicit willingness to attend
   to this global problem. This study investigates two potentially relevant
   predictors of implicit attention to climate change: a) pro-environmental
   orientation as a trait factor and b) experimentally induced stress as a
   state factor. We expected positive effects of pro-environmental
   orientation and negative effects of stress.
   Seventy-one male participants with either high or low pro-environmental
   orientation were randomly assigned to a stress or control condition.
   Afterwards, they viewed a series of climate change images and negative
   control images, which were presented simultaneously with positive and
   neutral distractors. Attentional deployment to the different stimulus
   categories was assessed using eye-tracking technology.
   Participants with high pro-environmental orientation spent more time
   looking at climate change as well as other negative images, compared to
   participants with low pro-environmental orientation. This result
   suggests that pro-environmental individuals might be characterized by a
   general propensity to attend to negative information. Furthermore,
   stress reduced attentional deployment to both climate change and
   negative control images, which might indicate decreased interest in
   self-transcendent problems and/or increased efforts of emotion
   regulation under stress. In summary, these findings constitute first
   evidence for trait and state predictors of attentional engagement with
   climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effects of soil warming history on the performances of congeneric
   temperate and boreal herbaceous plant species and their associations
   with soil biota}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{670-680}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   Climate warming raises the probability of range expansions of
   warm-adapted temperate species into areas currently dominated by
   coldadapted boreal species. Warming-induced plant range expansions could
   partly depend on how warming modifies relationships with soil biota that
   promote plant growth, such as by mineralizing nutrients. Here, we grew
   two pairs of congeneric herbaceous plants species together in soil with
   a 5-year warming history (ambient, +1.7 degrees C, +3.4 degrees C) and
   related their performances to plant-beneficial soil biota.
   Methods
   Each plant pair belonged to either the mid-latitude temperate climate or
   the higher latitude southern boreal climate. Warmed soils were extracted
   from a chamberless heating experiment at two field sites in the
   temperate-boreal ecotone of North America. To isolate potential effects
   of different soil warming histories, air temperature for the greenhouse
   experiment was identical across soils. We hypothesized that soil with a
   5-year warming history in the field would enhance the performance of
   temperate plant species more than boreal plant species and expected
   improved plant performances to have positive associations with plant
   growth-promoting soil biota (microbial-feeding nematodes and arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi).
   Important Findings
   Our main hypothesis was partly confirmed as only one temperate species
   performed better in soil with warming history than in soil with history
   of ambient temperature. Further, this effect was restricted to the site
   with higher soil water content in the growing season of the sampling
   year (prior to soil collection). One of the boreal species performed
   consistently worse in previously warmed soil, whereas the other species
   showed neutral responses to soil warming history. We found a positive
   correlation between the density of microbial-feeding nematodes and the
   performance of one of the temperate species in previously wetter soils,
   but this correlation was negative at the site with previously drier
   soil. We found no significant correlations between the performance of
   the other temperate species as well as the two boreal species and any of
   the studied soil biota. Our results indicate that soil warming can
   modify the relation between certain plant species and microbial-feeding
   nematodes in given soil edaphic conditions, which might be important for
   plant performance in the temperate-boreal ecotone.}},

Abstract = {{The worldwide increase in human outdoor activities raises concerns for
   wildlife. Human disturbances, even at low levels, are likely to impact
   species during sensitive periods of the annual cycle. However,
   experimental studies during the putative sensitive period of territory
   establishment of birds which not only investigate low disturbance
   levels, but which also exclude the effect of habitat modification (e.g.
   walking trails) are lacking. Here, we experimentally disturbed birds in
   forest plots by walking through twice a day during territory
   establishment. Later we compared the breeding bird community of
   experimentally disturbed plots with that of undisturbed control plots.
   We discovered that the number of territories (-15.0\%) and species
   richness (-15.2\%) in disturbed plots were substantially reduced
   compared with control plots. Species most affected included those
   sensitive to human presence (assessed by flight-initiation distances),
   open-cup nesters and above-ground foragers. Long-distance migrants,
   however, were unaffected due to their arrival after experimental
   disturbance took place. These findings highlight how territory
   establishment is a sensitive period for birds, when even low levels of
   human recreation may be perceived as threatening, and alter settlement
   decisions. This can have important implications for the conservation of
   species, which might go unnoticed when focusing only on already
   established birds.}},

Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{309-320}},

Abstract = {{Gazetteers are important tools used in a wide variety of workflows that
   depend on linking natural language text to geographical space. The
   spatial properties of these data sources, such as coverage, balance, and
   completeness, affect the performance of common tasks such as geoparsing
   and geocoding. However, little attention has focused on how these
   properties vary in global gazetteers, particularly across country
   boundaries and according to feature types. In this paper, we present a
   detailed investigation of the spatial properties of two open gazetteers
   with worldwide coverage: GeoNames, and the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic
   Names (TGN). Using point density maps, correlations, and linear
   regressions, we analyze the global spatial coverage of each data source
   for the full set of features and for top feature types: populated
   places, streams, mountains, and hills. Results show wide discrepancies
   in coverage between the two datasets, sharp changes in feature type
   coverage across country borders, and idiosyncratic patterns dominated by
   a few countries for the more sparsely covered natural features. As more
   and more systems rely on recognizing and grounding named places, these
   patterns can influence the analysis of growing amounts of online text
   content and reinforce or amplify existing inequalities. (C) 2017 The

Title = {{The measure and mismeasure of reciprocity in heterostylous flowers}},
Journal = {{NEW PHYTOLOGIST}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{215}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{906-917}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The goal of biological measurement is to capture underlying biological
   phenomena in numerical form. The reciprocity index applied to
   heterostylous flowers is meant to measure the degree of correspondence
   between fertile parts of opposite sex on complementary
   (inter-compatible) morphs, reflecting the correspondence of locations of
   pollen placement on, and stigma contact with, pollinators. Pollen of
   typical heterostylous flowers can achieve unimpeded fertilization only
   on opposite-morph flowers. Thus, the implicit goal of this measurement
   is to assess the likelihood of `legitimate' pollinations between
   compatible morphs, and hence reproductive fitness.
   Previous reciprocity metrics fall short of this goal on both empirical
   and theoretical grounds.
   We propose a new measure of reciprocity based on theory that relates
   floral morphology to reproductive fitness. This method establishes a
   scale based on adaptive inaccuracy, a measure of the fitness cost of the
   deviation of phenotypes in a population from the optimal phenotype.
   Inaccuracy allows the estimation of independent contributions of
   maladaptive bias (mean departure from optimum) and imprecision
   (within-population variance) to the phenotypic mismatch (inaccuracy) of
   heterostylous morphs on a common scale.
   We illustrate this measure using data from three species of Primula
   (Primulaceae).}},

Journal = {{NATURE ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Predicting population declines is a key challenge in the face of global
   environmental change. Abundance-based early warning signals have been
   shown to precede population collapses; however, such signals are
   sensitive to the low reliability of abundance estimates. Here, using
   historical data on whales harvested during the 20th century, we
   demonstrate that early warning signals can be present not only in the
   abundance data, but also in the more reliable body size data of wild
   populations. We show that during the period of commercial whaling, the
   mean body size of caught whales declined dramatically (by up to 4 m over
   a 70-year period), leading to early warning signals being detectable up
   to 40 years before the global collapse of whale stocks. Combining
   abundance and body size data can reduce the length of the time series
   required to predict collapse, and decrease the chances of false positive
   early warning signals.}},

Title = {{Duplicated pollen-pistil recognition loci control intraspecific
   unilateral incompatibility in Brassica rapa}},
Journal = {{NATURE PLANTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In plants, cell-cell recognition is a crucial step in the selection of
   optimal pairs of gametes to achieve successful propagation of progeny.
   Flowering plants have evolved various genetic mechanisms, mediated by
   cell-cell recognition, to enable their pistils to reject self-pollen,
   thus preventing inbreeding and the consequent reduced fitness of progeny
   (self-incompatibility, SI), and to reject foreign pollen from other
   species, thus maintaining species identity (interspecific
   incompatibility) 1. In the genus Brassica, the SI system is regulated by
   an S-haplotype-specific interaction between a stigma-expressed female
   receptor (S receptor kinase, SRK) and a tapetum cell-expressed male
   ligand (S locus protein 11, SP11), encoded by their respective
   polymorphic genes at the S locus2-6. However, the molecular mechanism
   for recognition of foreign pollen, leading to reproductive
   incompatibility, has not yet been identified. Here, we show that
   recognition between a novel pair of proteins, a pistil receptor SUI1
   (STIGMATIC UNILATERAL INCOMPATIBILITY 1) and a pollen ligand PUI1
   (POLLEN UNILATERAL INCOMPATIBILITY 1), triggers unilateral reproductive
   incompatibility between plants of two geographically distant
   self-incompatible Brassica rapa lines, even though crosses would be
   predicted to be compatible based on the S haplotypes of pollen and
   stigma. Interestingly, SUI1 and PUI1 are similar to the SI genes, SRK
   and SP11, respectively, and are maintained as cryptic incompatibility
   genes in these two populations. The duplication of the SRK and SP11
   followed by reciprocal loss in different populations would provide a
   molecular mechanism of the emergence of a reproductive barrier in
   allopatry.}},

Abstract = {{Diacylglycerol (DAG) is an important intermediate in lipid biosynthesis
   and plays key roles in cell signaling, either as a second messenger
   itself or as a precursor of phosphatidic acid. Methods to identify
   distinct DAG pools have proven difficult because biochemical
   fractionation affects the pools, and concentrations are limiting. Here,
   we validate the use of a genetically encoded DAG biosensor in living
   plant cells. The sensor is composed of a fusion between yellow
   fluorescent protein and the C1a domain of protein kinase C (YFPC1aPKC)
   that specifically binds DAG, and was stably expressed in
   suspension-cultured tobacco BY-2 cells and whole Arabidopsis thaliana
   plants. Confocal imaging revealed that the majority of the YFP-C1aPKC
   fluorescence did not locate to membranes but was present in the cytosol
   and nucleus. Treatment with short-chain DAG or PMA
   (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate), a phorbol ester that binds the C1a
   domain of PKC, caused the recruitment of the biosensor to the plasma
   membrane. These results indicate that the biosensor works and that the
   basal DAG concentration in the cytoplasmic leaflet of membranes (i.e.
   accessible to the biosensor) is in general too low, and confirms that
   the known pools in plastids, the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria
   are located at the luminal face of these compartments (i.e. inaccessible
   to the biosensor). Nevertheless, detailed further analysis of different
   cells and tissues discovered four novel DAG pools, namely at: (i) the
   trans-Golgi network; (ii) the cell plate during cytokinesis; (iii) the
   plasma membrane of root epidermal cells in the transition zone, and (iv)
   the apex of growing root hairs. The results provide new insights into
   the spatiotemporal dynamics of DAG in plants and offer a new tool to
   monitor this in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Conidia of the obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis f.
   sp. tritici (Bgt) play a vital role in its survival and rapid dispersal.
   However, little is known about the genetic basis for its asexual
   reproduction. To uncover the primary metabolic and regulatory events
   during conidiation, we sequenced the transcriptome of Bgt epiphytic
   structures at 3 (vegetative hyphae growth), 4 (foot cells initiation),
   and 5 (conidiophore erection) days post-inoculation (dpi). RNA-seq
   analyses identified 556 and 404 (combined 685) differentially expressed
   genes (DEGs) at 4 and 5 dpi compared with their expression levels at 3
   dpi, respectively. We found that several genes involved in the
   conversion from a variety of sugars to glucose, glycolysis, the
   tricarboxylic acid cycle (TAC), the electron transport chain (ETC), and
   unsaturated fatty acid oxidation were activated during conidiation,
   suggesting that more energy supply is required during this process.
   Moreover, we found that glucose was converted into glycogen, which was
   accumulated in developing conidiophores, indicating that it could be the
   primary energy storage molecule in Bgt conidia. Clustering for the
   expression profiles of 91 regulatory genes showed that calcium (Ca2+),
   H2O2, and phosphoinositide (PIP) signaling were involved in Bgt
   conidiation. Furthermore, a strong accumulation of H2O2 in developing
   conidiophores was detected. Application of EGTA, a Ca2+ chelator, and
   trifluoperazine dihydrochloride (TFP), a calmodulin (CaM) antagonist,
   markedly suppressed the generation of H2O2, affected foot cell and
   conidiophore development and reduced conidia production significantly.
   These results suggest that Ca2+ and H2O2 signaling play important roles
   in conidiogenesis and a crosslink between them is present. In addition
   to some conidiation-related orthologs known in other fungi, such as the
   velvet complex components, we identified several other novel B.
   graminis-specific genes that have not been previously found to be
   implicated in fungal conidiation, reflecting a unique molecular
   mechanism underlying asexual development of cereal powdery mildews.}},

Abstract = {{Calopteryx exul is an endemic endangered damselfly that suffers
   considerable habitat degradation and local extinctions throughout its
   geographic range. Although recent studies have investigated its
   distribution, ecology and larval systematics, the life history of the
   species is still unknown. In this study, a field survey was conducted to
   determine larval development, temporal pattern of emergence and teneral
   spatial distribution of the species in the Seybouse watershed,
   north-east Algeria. Larval growth was investigated in two populations:
   one at about 200 m (low-elevation population) and the second at 600 m of
   elevation (high-elevation population). The species showed partial
   bivoltine life cycle in both low-and high-elevation population. The
   temporal pattern of emergence of the first flight season of the year at
   low-elevation population was asynchronous with an emergence season
   lasting 46 days and half of the population emerging in 15 days. The
   second flight season was shorter with a most likely smaller population
   size. Sex ratio at emergence was slightly male biased. After ecdysis,
   tenerals stayed next to the water within a mean distance of 4.76 +/-
   4.35 m (+/- SD) with no significant difference between sexes.
   Conservation measures that should be taken into account in the
   elaboration of future management plans for the species are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The first European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA collaboration in an
   airborne campaign to support ESA's FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission
   was conducted in North Carolina, USA during September-October 2013
   (FLEX-US 2013) at the Parker Tract Loblolly Pine (LP) Plantation
   (Plymouth, NC, USA). This campaign combined two unique airborne
   instrument packages to obtain simultaneous observations of solar-induced
   fluorescence (SIF), LiDAR-based canopy structural information, visible
   through shortwave infrared (VSWIR) reflectance spectra, and surface
   temperature, to advance vegetation studies of carbon cycle dynamics and
   ecosystem health. We obtained statistically significant results for
   fluorescence, canopy temperature, and tower fluxes from data collected
   at four times of day over two consecutive autumn days across an age
   class chronosequence. Both the red fluorescence (F685) and far-red
   fluorescence (F740) radiances had highest values at mid-day, but their
   fluorescence yields exhibited different diurnal responses across LP age
   classes. The diurnal trends for F685 varied with forest canopy
   temperature difference (canopy minus air), having a stronger daily
   amplitude change for young vs. old canopies. The Photochemical
   Reflectance Index (PRI) was positively correlated with this temperature
   variable over the diurnal cycle. Tower measurements from mature loblolly
   stand showed the red/far-red fluorescence ratio was linearly related to
   canopy light use efficiency (LUE) over the diurnal cycle, but performed
   even better for the combined morning/afternoon (without midday)
   observations. This study demonstrates the importance of diurnal
   observations for interpretation of fluorescence dynamics, the need for
   red fluorescence to understand canopy physiological processes, and the
   benefits of combining fluorescence, reflectance, and structure
   information to clarify canopy function versus structure characteristics
   for a coniferous forest.}},

Volume = {{189}},

Abstract = {{Both body size and temperature directly influence consumer-resource
   dynamics. There is also widespread empirical evidence for the
   temperature-size rule (TSR), which creates a negative relationship
   between temperature and body size. However, it is not known how the TSR
   affects community dynamics. Here we integrate temperature- and
   size-dependent models to include indirect effects of warming, through
   changes in body size, to answer the question, How does the TSR affect
   the predicted response of consumer-resource systems to warming? We find
   that the TSR is expected to maintain consumer-resource biomass ratios
   and buffer the community from extinctions under warming. While our
   results are limited to conditions where organisms are below their
   thermal optimum, they hold under a range of realistic temperature-size

Abstract = {{Theory holds that adaptive phenotypic plasticity evolves under spatial
   or temporal variation in natural selection. I tested this prediction in
   a classic system of predator-induced plasticity: frog tadpoles (Rana
   temporaria) reacting to predaceous aquatic insects. An outdoor mesocosm
   experiment manipulating exposure to Aeshna dragonfly larvae revealed
   plasticity in most characters: growth, development, behavior, and
   external morphology. I measured selection by placing 1927 tadpoles into
   enclosures within natural ponds; photographs permitted identification of
   the survivors six to nine days later. Fitness was defined as a linear
   combination of growth, development, and survival that correlates with
   survival to age 2 in another anuran species. In enclosures with many
   predators, selection-favored character values similar to those induced
   by exposure to Aeshna in mesocosms. The shift in selection along the
   predation gradient was strongest for characters that exhibited high
   predator-induced plasticity. A field survey of 50 ponds revealed that
   predator density changes over a spatial scale relevant for movement of
   individual adults and larvae: 17\% of variation in predation risk was
   among ponds separated by tens to thousands of meters and 81\% was among
   sites 10 m apart within ponds. These results on heterogeneity in the
   selection regime confirm a key tenant of the standard model for the
   evolution of plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{H1 (or linker) histones are basic nuclear proteins that possess an
   evolutionarily conserved nucleosome-binding globular domain, GH1. They
   perform critical functions in determining the accessibility of chromatin
   DNA to trans-acting factors. In most metazoan species studied so far,
   linker histones are highly heterogenous, with numerous nonallelic
   variants cooccurring in the same cells. The phylogenetic relationships
   among these variants as well as their structural and functional
   properties have been relatively well established. This contrasts
   markedly with the rather limited knowledge concerning the phylogeny and
   structural and functional roles of an unusually diverse group of
   GH1-containing proteins in plants. The dearth of information and the
   lack of a coherent phylogeny-based nomenclature of these proteins can
   lead to misunderstandings regarding their identity and possible
   relationships, thereby hampering plant chromatin research. Based on
   published data and our in silico and high-throughput analyses, we
   propose a systematization and coherent nomenclature of GH1-containing
   proteins of Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana {[}L.] Heynh) that will
   be useful for both the identification and structural and functional
   characterization of homologous proteins from other plant species.}},

Title = {{Resistance of plant-plant networks to biodiversity loss and secondary
   extinctions following simulated environmental changes}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1145-1152}},

Abstract = {{1. Plant interactions are fundamental processes for structuring plant
   communities and are an important mechanism governing the response of
   plant species and communities to environmental changes. Thus,
   understanding the role played by the interaction network in modulating
   the impact of environmental changes on plant community composition and
   diversity is crucial. Here, we aimed to develop a new analytical and
   conceptual framework to evaluate the responses of plant communities to
   environmental changes.
   2. This framework uses functional traits as sensitivity measures for
   simulated environmental changes and assesses the consequences of
   microhabitat loss. We show here its application to an alpine plant
   community where we recorded functional traits {[}specific leaf area
   (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC)] of all plants associated with
   three foundation species or the surrounding open areas. We then
   simulated primary species loss based on different scenarios of
   environmental change and explored community persistence to the loss of
   foundation species.
   3. Generally, plant community responses differed among environmental
   change scenarios. In a scenario of increasing drought alone (i.e.
   species with lower LDMC were lost first) or increasing drought with
   increasing temperature (i.e. species with lower LDMC and higher SLA were
   lost first), the plant community resisted because drought-tolerant
   foundation species tolerated those deteriorating conditions. However, in
   scenarios with increasing nitrogen input (i.e. species having lower SLA
   were lost earlier), foundation species accelerated species loss due to
   their early primary extinctions and the corresponding secondary
   extinctions of species associated to their microhabitat.
   4. The resistance of a plant community depends on the driver of
   environmental change, meaning that the prediction of the fate of this
   system is depending on the knowledge of the main driver of environmental
   change. Our framework provides a mechanistic understanding of an
   ecosystem response to such environmental changes thanks to the
   integration of biology-informed criteria of species sensitivities to
   environmental factors into a network of interacting species.}},

Abstract = {{Snow cover impacts alpine land surface phenology in various ways, but
   our knowledge about the effect of snow cover on alpine land surface
   phenology is still limited. We studied this relationship in the European
   Alps using satellite-derived metrics of snow cover phenology (SCP),
   namely, first snow fall, last snow day, and snow cover duration (SCD),
   in combination with land surface phenology (LSP), namely, start of
   season (SOS), end of season, and length of season (LOS) for the period
   of 2003-2014. We tested the dependency of interannual differences () of
   SCP and LSP metrics with altitude (up to 3000m above sea level) for
   seven natural vegetation types, four main climatic subregions, and four
   terrain expositions. We found that 25.3\% of all pixels showed
   significant (p<0.05) correlation between SCD and SOS and 15.3\% between
   SCD and LOS across the entire study area. Correlations between SCD and
   SOS as well as SCD and LOS are more pronounced in the northern
   subregions of the Alps, at high altitudes, and on north and west facing
   terrainor more generally, in regions with longer SCD. We conclude that
   snow cover has a greater effect on alpine phenology at higher than at
   lower altitudes, which may be attributed to the coupled influence of
   snow cover with underground conditions and air temperature. Alpine
   ecosystems may therefore be particularly sensitive to future change of
   snow cover at high altitudes under climate warming scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic devices contain important resources, including precious and
   critical raw materials. For an efficient management of these resources,
   it is important to know where the devices are located, how long they are
   used and when and how they are disposed of. In this article, we explore
   the past and current quantities of electronic devices in the in-use
   stock and storage stock in Switzerland and quantify the flows between
   the use, storage and disposal phase with dynamic material flow analysis
   (MFA). Devices included are mobile phones, desktop and laptop computers,
   monitors, cathode ray tube and flat panel display televisions, DVD
   players, and headphones. The system for the dynamic MFA was developed as
   a cascade model dividing the use phase in first, second and further use,
   with each of these steps consisting of an in use stock and a storage
   stock for devices. Using a customized software tool, we apply Monte
   Carlo simulation to systematically consider data uncertainty. The
   results highlight the importance of the storage stock, which accounts
   for 25\% (in terms of mass) or 40\% (in terms of pieces) of the total
   stock of electronic devices in 2014. Reuse and storage significantly
   influence the total lifetime of devices and lead to wide and positively
   skewed lifetime distributions.}},

Title = {{Modelling different reintroduction strategies for the critically

Journal = {{ANIMAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{144-154}},

Abstract = {{One of the main recommendations of reintroduction biology for
   prospective projects is that they should be planned with local species
   knowledge and with species-specific quantitative modelling, for example,
   from population viability analysis (PVA). Here, we apply this approach
   to the planned reintroduction of the critically endangered Floreana
   mockingbird Mimus trifasciatus in the Galapagos Archipelago. After its
   extinction on Floreana Island, the Floreana mockingbird today only
   persists on two small islets, Champion and Gardner. In the context of a
   wider island restoration project, there are plans to reintroduce
   M.trifasciatus back to Floreana to establish a population as large and
   genetically diverse as possible, while minimizing the impact on the two
   source populations. To aid the planning of this reintroduction effort,
   we compared six potential reintroduction strategies that differ in three
   aspects: (1) use of captive breeding, (2) state-(in)dependent sourcing
   of birds, (3) time span for translocations. We assessed the strategies'
   performance using a multi-site count-based PVA and simulations of
   coancestry as a measure of genetic diversity. In general, PVA and
   coancestry results were comparable in terms of the strategies'
   performance. Strategies with captive breeding resulted in larger
   population sizes and higher genetic diversity on Floreana after 20
   years. However, the advantages of captive breeding disappeared when the
   population growth rate in captivity or on Floreana was very low. The
   reintroductions did not negatively impact the source populations'
   viability, provided no more than 2 and 16 birds were taken annually from
   the two source islets. The approach employed here shows how a
   count-based PVA in combination with simulations of genetic diversity can
   help reintroduction planning.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity and community composition of ground arthropods is
   routinely analyzed by pitfall trap sampling, which is a cost- and
   time-effective method to gather large numbers of replicates but also
   known to generate data that are biased by species-specific differences
   in locomotory activity. Previous studies have looked at factors that
   influence the sampling bias. These studies, however, were limited to one
   or few species and did rarely quantify how the species-specific sampling
   bias shapes community-level diversity metrics. In this study, we
   systematically quantify the species-specific and community-level
   sampling bias with an allometric individual-based model that simulates
   movement and pitfall sampling of 10 generic ground arthropod species
   differing in body mass. We perform multiple simulation experiments
   covering different scenarios of pitfall trap number, spatial trap
   arrangement, temperature, and population density. We show that the
   sampling bias decreased strongly with increasing body mass, temperature,
   and pitfall trap number, while population density had no effect and trap
   arrangement only had little effect. The average movement speed of a
   species in the field integrates body mass and temperature effects and
   could be used to derive reliable estimates of absolute species
   abundance. We demonstrate how unbiased relative species abundance can be
   derived using correction factors that need only information on species
   body mass. We find that community-level diversity metrics are sensitive
   to the particular community structure, namely the relation between body
   mass and relative abundance across species. Generally, pitfall trap
   sampling flattens the rank-abundance distribution and leads to
   overestimations of ground arthropod Shannon diversity. We conclude that
   the correction of the species-specific pitfall trap sampling bias is
   necessary for the reliability of conclusions drawn from ground arthropod
   field studies. We propose bias correction is a manageable task using
   either body mass to derive unbiased relative abundance or the average
   speed to derive reliable estimates of absolute abundance from pitfall
   trap sampling.}},

Title = {{Influence of internal variability on population exposure to
   hydroclimatic changes}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Future freshwater supply, human water demand, and people's exposure to
   water stress are subject to multiple sources of uncertainty, including
   unknown future pathways of fossil fuel and water consumption, and
   `irreducible' uncertainty arising from internal climate system
   variability. Such internal variability can conceal forced hydroclimatic
   changes on multi-decadal timescales and near-continental spatial-scales.
   Using three projections of population growth, a large ensemble from a
   single Earth system model, and assuming stationary per capita water
   consumption, we quantify the likelihoods of future population exposure
   to increased hydroclimatic deficits, which we define as the average
   duration and magnitude by which evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation
   in a basin. We calculate that by 2060, similar to 31\%-35\% of the
   global population will be exposed to >50\% probability of hydroclimatic
   deficit increases that exceed existing hydrological storage, with up to
   9\% of people exposed to >90\% probability. However, internal
   variability, which is an irreducible uncertainty in climate model
   predictions that is under-sampled in water resource projections, creates
   substantial uncertainty in predicted exposure:. 86\%-91\% of people will
   reside where irreducible uncertainty spans the potential for both
   increases and decreases in sub-annual water deficits. In one population
   scenario, changes in exposure to large hydroclimate deficits vary from
   -3\% to +6\% of global population, a range arising entirely from
   internal variability. The uncertainty in risk arising from irreducible
   uncertainty in the precise pattern of hydroclimatic change, which is
   typically conflated with other uncertainties in projections, is critical
   for climate risk management that seeks to optimize adaptations that are
   robust to the full set of potential real-world outcomes.}},

Title = {{Reproductive consequences of farmland heterogeneity in little owls

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},

Abstract = {{The amount of high-quality habitat patches, their distribution, and the
   resource accessibility therein play a key role in regulating habitat
   effects on reproductive success. Heterogeneous habitats offer
   non-substitutable resources (e.g. nest sites and food) and substitutable
   resources (e.g. different types of food) in close proximity, thereby
   facilitating landscape complementation and supplementation. However, it
   remains poorly understood how spatial resource separation in homogeneous
   agricultural landscapes affects reproductive success. To fill this gap,
   we investigated the relationships between farmland heterogeneity and
   little owl (Athene noctua) reproductive success, including potential
   indirect effects of the heterogeneity-dependent home-range size on
   reproduction. Little owl home-ranges were related to field heterogeneity
   in summer and to structural heterogeneity in winter. Clutch size was
   correlated with the amount of food-rich habitat close to the nest
   irrespective of female home-range size, suggesting importance of
   landscape complementation. Nestling survival was positively correlated
   with male home-range size, suggesting importance of landscape
   supplementation. At the same time, fledgling condition was negatively
   correlated with male home-range size. We conclude that decreasing
   farmland heterogeneity constrains population productivity by two
   processes: increasing separation of food resources from nest or roost
   sites results in low landscape complementation, and reduction of
   alternative food resources limits landscape supplementation. Our results
   suggest that structural heterogeneity affects landscape complementation,
   whereas the heterogeneity and management of farmland fields affect
   landscape supplementation. Thus, to what extent a reduction of the
   heterogeneity within agricultural landscapes results in species-specific
   habitat degradation depends on the ecological processes (i.e. landscape
   complementation or supplementation) which are affected.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Being away is considered a key requirement for restoring depleted
   cognitive resources. However, it is unclear which human-environment
   transactions promote or constrain the sense of being away. This study
   examines whether perceived interdependencies between cognitively
   demanding and leisure-time settings can reduce the perceived sense of
   being away. The results from an online survey of German adults indicated
   that self-reported health-related outcomes after leisure time were
   related to the perceived sense of being away during leisure time. Both
   the perceived sense of being away and self reported health-related
   outcomes were impaired when people perceived more interdependencies
   between cognitively demanding and leisure-time settings. The findings
   suggest that people report a stronger sense of being away and increased
   health and well-being when perceived setting interdependencies are
   reduced. This application of behavior setting theory in the restorative
   environments framework provides a more sophisticated understanding of
   human-environment transactions that may constrain or promote health and

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Performing proteomic studies on non-model organisms with little or no
   genomic information is still difficult. However, many specific processes
   and biochemical pathways occur only in species that are poorly
   characterized at the genomic level. For example, many plants can
   reproduce both sexually and asexually, the first one allowing the
   generation of new genotypes and the latter their fixation. Thus, both
   modes of reproduction are of great agronomic value. However, the
   molecular basis of asexual reproduction is not well understood in any
   plant. In ferns, it combines the production of unreduced spores
   (diplospory) and the formation of sporophytes from somatic cells
   (apogamy). To set the basis to study these processes, we performed
   transcriptomics by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and shotgun
   proteomics by tandem mass spectrometry in the apogamous fern D. affinis
   ssp. affinis. For protein identification we used the public
   viridiplantae database (VPDB) to identify orthologous proteins from
   other plant species and new transcriptomics data to generate a
   ``species-specific transcriptome database{''} (SSTDB). In total 1,397
   protein clusters with 5,865 unique peptide sequences were identified (13
   decoy proteins out of 1,410, protFDR 0.93\% on protein cluster level).
   We show that using the SSTDB for protein identification increases the
   number of identified peptides almost four times compared to using only
   the publically available VPDB. We identified homologs of proteins
   involved in reproduction of higher plants, including proteins with a
   potential role in apogamy. With the increasing availability of genomic
   data from non -model species, similar proteogenomics approaches will
   improve the sensitivity in protein identification for species only
   distantly related to models.}},

Abstract = {{As remote sensing (RS) applications and resources continue to expand,
   their importance for ecology and conservation increases - and so does
   the need for effective and successful training of professionals working
   in those fields. Methodological and applied courses often form part of
   university curricula, but their practical and long-term benefits only
   become clear afterwards. Having recently received such training in an
   interdisciplinary master's programme, we provide our perspectives on our
   shared education. Through an online survey we include experiences of
   students and professionals in different fields. Most participants
   perceive their RS education as useful for their career, but express a
   need for more training at university level. Hands-on projects are
   considered the most effective learning method. Besides methodological
   knowledge, soft skills are clear gains, including problem solving,
   self-learning and finding individual solutions, and the ability to work
   in interdisciplinary teams. The largest identified gaps in current RS
   training concern the application regarding policy making, methodology
   and conservation. To successfully prepare students for a career, study
   programmes need to provide RS courses based on state-of-the-art methods,
   including programming, and interdisciplinary projects linking research
   and practice supported by a sound technical background.}},

Abstract = {{Comprehensive research on glacier changes in the Tian Shan is available
   for the current decade; however, there is limited information about
   glacier investigations of previous decades and especially before the mid
   1970s. The earliest stereo images from the Corona missions were acquired
   in the 1960s but existing studies dealing with these images focus on
   single glaciers or small areas only. We developed a workflow to generate
   digital terrain models (DTMs) and orthophotos from 1964 Corona KH-4 for
   an entire mountain range (Ak-Shirak) located in the Central Tian Shan.
   From these DTMs and orthoimages, we calculated geodetic mass balances
   and length changes in comparison to 1973 and 1980 Hexagon KH-9 data. We
   found mass budgets between -0.4 +/- 0.1 mw.e.a(-1) (1964-1980) and -0.9
   +/- 0.4 mw.e.a(-1) (1973-1980) for the whole region and individual
   glaciers. The length changes, on the other hand, vary heterogeneously
   between +624 +/- 18 m (+39.0 +/- 1.1 ma(-1)) and -923 +/- 18 m (-57.7
   +/- 1.1 ma(-1)) for 1964-1980. An automation of the processing line can
   successively lead to region-wide Corona data processing allowing the
   analysis and interpretation of glacier changes on a larger scale and
   supporting a refinement of glacier modelling.}},

Abstract = {{The tiller inhibition gene (tin) that reduces tillering in wheat
   (Triticum aestivum) is also associated with large spikes, increased
   grain weight, and thick leaves and stems. In this study, comparison of
   near-isogenic lines (NILs) revealed changes in stem morphology, cell
   wall composition, and stem strength. Microscopic analysis of stem
   cross-sections and chemical analysis of stem tissue indicated that cell
   walls in tin lines were thicker and more lignified than in
   free-tillering NILs. Increased lignification was associated with
   stronger stems in tin plants. A candidate gene for tin was identified
   through map-based cloning and was predicted to encode a cellulose
   synthase-like (Csl) protein with homology to members of the CslA clade.
   Dinucleotide repeat-length polymorphism in the 5 `UTR region of the Csl
   gene was associated with tiller number in diverse wheat germplasm and
   linked to expression differences of Csl transcripts between NILs. We
   propose that regulation of Csl transcript and/or protein levels affects
   carbon partitioning throughout the plant, which plays a key role in the

Abstract = {{Genomewide markers enable us to study genetic differentiation within a
   species and the factors underlying it at a much higher resolution than
   before, which advances our understanding of adaptation in organisms. We
   investigated genomic divergence in Metrosideros polymorpha, a woody
   species that occupies a wide range of ecological habitats across the
   Hawaiian Islands and shows remarkable phenotypic variation. Using 1659
   single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers annotated with the genome
   assembly, we examined the population genetic structure and demographic
   history of nine populations across five elevations and two ages of
   substrates on Mauna Loa, the island of Hawaii. The nine populations were
   differentiated into two genetic clusters distributed on the lower and
   higher elevations and were largely admixed on the middle elevation.
   Demographic modelling revealed that the two genetic clusters have been
   maintained in the face of gene flow, and the effective population size
   of the high-altitude cluster was much smaller. A F-ST-based outlier
   search among the 1659 SNPs revealed that 34 SNPs (2.05\%) were likely to
   be under divergent selection and the allele frequencies of 21 of them
   were associated with environmental changes along elevations, such as
   temperature and precipitation. This study shows a genomic mosaic of
   M.polymorpha, in which contrasting divergence patterns were found. While
   most genomic polymorphisms were shared among populations, a small
   fraction of the genome was significantly differentiated between
   populations in diverse environments and could be responsible for the
   dramatic adaptation to a wide range of environments.}},

Title = {{Trait-demography relationships underlying small mammal population
   fluctuations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{348-358}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Large-scale fluctuations in abundance are a common feature of small
   mammal populations and have been the subject of extensive research.
   These demographic fluctuations are often associated with concurrent
   changes in the average body mass of individuals, sometimes referred to
   as the `Chitty effect'. Despite the long-standing recognition of this
   phenomenon, an empirical investigation of the underlying coupled
   dynamics of body mass and population growth has been lacking.
   2. Using long-term life-history data combined with a trait-based
   demographic approach, we examined the relationship between body mass and
   demography in a small mammal population that exhibits non-cyclic,
   large-scale fluctuations in abundance. We used data from the male
   segment of a 25-year study of the monogamous prairie vole, Microtus
   ochrogaster, in Illinois, USA. Specifically, we investigated how
   trait-demography relationships and trait distributions changed between
   different phases of population fluctuations, and the consequences of
   these changes for both trait and population dynamics.
   3. We observed phase-specific changes in male adult body mass
   distribution in this population of prairie voles. Our analyses revealed
   that these changes were driven by variation in ontogenetic growth,
   rather than selection acting on the trait. The resulting changes in body
   mass influenced most life-history processes, and these effects varied
   among phases of population fluctuation. However, these changes did not
   propagate to affect the population growth rate due to the small effect
   of body mass on vital rates, compared to the overall differences in
   vital rates between phases. The increase phase of the fluctuations was
   initiated by enhanced survival, particularly of juveniles and fecundity,
   whereas the decline phase was driven by an overall reduction in
   fecundity, survival and maturation rates.
   4. Our study provides empirical support, as well as a potential
   mechanism, underlying the observed trait changes accompanying population
   fluctuations. Body size dynamics and population fluctuations resulted
   from different life-history processes. Therefore, we conclude that body
   size dynamics in our population do not drive the observed population
   dynamics. This more in-depth understanding of different components of
   small mammal population fluctuations will help us to better identify the
   mechanistic drivers of this interesting phenomenon.}},

Title = {{Interactions between a root hemiparasite and 27 different hosts: Growth,
   biomass allocation and plant architecture}},
Journal = {{PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of many different
   host species and their traits on the performance, morphology and
   architecture of the root hemiparasite Melampyrum arvense L., as well as
   the effect of the parasite on the growth and biomass allocation of its
   hosts. M. arvense was grown at two nutrient levels with 27 host species
   (grasses, legumes, and forbs) from habitats differing in nutrient
   availability. The biomass of the parasite varied enormously (475-fold)
   depending on the host species. The mean fraction of parasite biomass
   allocated to roots (RMF) decreased with increasing quality of a host
   (measured as total biomass of the parasite) and was only 3\% with the
   best host. An extensive review of published studies showed that access
   to a host in most cases reduces RMF of root hemiparasites and that the
   RMF of annual root hemiparasites is low compared to that of autotrophic
   plants, suggesting that a reduced expenditure on roots is an important
   advantage of hemiparasitism for annual parasites. In contrast, the RMF
   of hemiparasitic perennial herbs and woody plants was found to be
   similar to that of autotrophic plants.
   Host identity and nutrients also strongly influenced traits of M.
   arvense other than biomass, e.g. leaf size, seed mass, leaf chlorophyll
   concentration, nitrogen concentration, height, and the number of
   vegetative internodes. However, while host plant identity influenced
   allometric relationships, most of the effects of nutrient level were due
   to simple changes in overall parasite size. Individual parasite biomass
   was not correlated with the final shoot or root mass of the host plants
   growing in the same pot, but increased weakly with host nitrogen
   concentration. Mean host size at the time of parasite planting, host
   functional type and the nutrient state of the typical host habitat
   influenced mean parasite biomass and together explained 64\% of its
   variation. Parasite growth increased with initial host mass, was higher
   with legumes and forbs than with grasses, and higher with hosts from
   nutrient-rich habitats.
   Host damage due to parasitism increased with mean biomass of the
   parasite, and was lower for fast-growing species and higher for legumes
   and forbs than for grasses. Differences in damage between similarly good
   hosts indicated that not only resistance but also tolerance may be
   important for host responses to parasitism. M. arvense also caused
   changes in host allometry and increased host RMF, particularly in good
   host species. However, an extensive literature review found that there
   is no consistent general pattern of a higher RMF in hosts that are
   parasitized. Total productivity per pot was reduced by parasite presence
   suggesting lower resource use efficiency of the parasite, but not for
   all parasite - host combinations. Patterns of host quality for M.
   arvense and for its impact on host species differed strongly from those
   found for the related model hemiparasite Rhinanthus and suggest that
   hemiparasite - host species interactions may be parasite-specific. (C)

Abstract = {{Biodiversity undergoes unprecedented rates of erosion despite the
   important services it provides. This is considered evidence that
   biodiversity is undervalued. Biodiversity valuation is accordingly a
   prominent issue in the literature. Economic valuations are, however,
   largely criticized. Numerous alternatives have been introduced. Most of
   them involve participatory protocols aimed at producing high-quality
   results. Being time-consuming and expensive, it is difficult to
   implement and reproduce them at a large scale. We produce an easily
   reproducible, inexpensive survey methodology to measure impartial
   preference for biodiversity. We implement it in Switzerland through a
   mail-based survey. Our result is that biodiversity should be ranked
   after retirement schemes and public transportation, but before relations
   with foreign countries, order and security, and culture and leisure in
   the expanses of the State. Current expenses therefore substantially
   underestimate the value that Swiss people grant to biodiversity. Our new
   method is a viable alternative to standard economic valuation. Given the
   impartiality achieved, at least in the Swiss political context our
   estimate can be used by decision makers to assess the legitimacy of
   conservation programs or to gauge public support. At a philosophical
   level, our measure is relevant for public policies because it captures
   the stances that people take when they participate in public decisions.

Title = {{Defining the role of fire in alleviating seed dormancy in a rare
   Mediterranean endemic subshrub}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a topical issue in the management of many ecosystems globally
   that face a drying climate. Understanding the role of fire in such
   ecosystems is critical to inform appropriate management practices,
   particularly in the case of rare and ecologically specialized species.
   The Mediterranean heathlands are highly fire-prone and occur in a
   biodiversity hotspot increasingly threatened by human activities, and
   determining the reproductive thresholds of at-risk heathland species is
   critical to ensuring the success of future conservation initiatives.
   This study examined the germination biology of the threatened
   carnivorous subshrub Drosophyllum lusitanicum, with specific focus on
   the role of fire-related cues (heat and smoke) in combination with
   seasonal temperatures and moisture conditions to determine how these
   factors regulate seed dormancy and germination. We found that D.
   lusitanicum produces water-permeable, physiologically dormant seeds with
   a fully developed, capitate embryo that when fresh (similar to 1 month
   old) and without treatment germinate to 20-40 \% within 4-8 weeks. Seeds
   possess a restricted thermal window (15-20 degrees C) for germination
   and a neutral photoblastic response. Seed dormancy was overcome through
   precision nicking of the seed coat (>90 \% germination) or by short
   exposure to dry heat (80 or 100 degrees C) for 5-30 min (60-100 \%
   germination). We propose seedling emergence from the soil seed bank may
   be cued by the passage of fire, or by soil disturbance from the movement
   and browsing of animals. Long-term population viability is likely to be
   contingent upon appropriate management of the persistent soil seed bank,
   as well as the adequate management of key ecological disturbances such
   as fire. Drosophyllum lusitanicum faces an increasingly bleak future in
   the absence of conservation and management initiatives aimed at reducing
   habitat fragmentation in heathlands and aligning fire management and
   livestock practices with biodiversity outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding global climate change and its impacts on glaciers in the
   inner tropics is challenged by an absent climate seasonality that
   requires glacier monitoring at increased frequencies. Conejeras glacier
   in Colombia has been monitored monthly for 10 years, contributing to the
   limited knowledge of glacier mass development in this region. We
   acquired a terrestrial Lidar digital elevation model (DEM) and performed
   a full homogenization of the time series. Applying a number of
   interpolation methods, we calculated glacier-wide balances and deduced
   respective uncertainties. All interpolation methods revealed comparable
   variations in monthly surface mass balance, but the profile method
   failed in certain cases. We recommend using the Index-site method for
   monthly and annual and the Contour-line method for annual surface mass
   balances. Even when strongly reducing the stake network, the Index-site
   method and geostatistical interpolations (Kriging and Topo to Raster)
   showed robust and reliable results. Conejeras glacier is strongly
   down-wasting with a mass loss of 29 400mm w.e. and an area shrinkage of
   20\% within 10 years. Surface mass balance variations were strongest
   from November to February and depend largely on the intensity of El Nino
   Southern Oscillation. With a repeat DEM in the near future the
   glaciological time series could be validated with the geodetic mass
   balance. We recommend continuing the monthly monitoring programme, but
   complementing it with an energy balance study using additional
   meteorological data to better explain the glacier-climate interactions.
   However, to track the glacier's mass variations, a monitoring network
   with lower measurement frequency and stake density would be sufficient.}},

Title = {{Confrontational assessment in the roving male promiscuity mating system
   of the Bornean orangutan}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In many solitary mammalian species, females live alone in relatively
   small home ranges whereas males roam widely and converge around, and
   compete for matings with fertile females. In primates, orangutans are
   the only diurnal semi solitary species showing this roving male
   promiscuity mating system. Here, we develop and test hypotheses about
   the nature of male-male competition in Bornean orangutans by examining
   its sexually selected long-distance calls to disentangle the mechanisms
   through which males compete over mating access. This study uses a novel
   approach to disentangle the mechanisms of male-male competition. We
   established an acoustic localization system (ALS) comprising 20
   recorders installed in a grid that allowed accurate localization in an
   area of 450 ha. With this procedure, we triangulated 1615 long calls
   over 109 days spread over 10 months to examine the males' ranging and
   calling decisions. A male's choice of area was determined mainly by
   local fruit availability. Once there, however, his calling behavior
   depended primarily on the number of sexually attractive females and the
   number of other flanged males present. Both these variables also
   predicted the proportion of calls to which individual males responded,
   and the proportion of males present that responded to long calls of
   other males. We conclude that intra-sexual competition among Bornean
   flanged males comprises a combination of contest and scramble
   competition best summarized as confrontational assessment.
   Significance statement
   Where males range widely in search of scattered fertile females and
   these females do not broadcast their reproductive state, males could
   pursue a variety of strategies. Flanged male Bornean orangutans emit
   long calls serving to attract females and repel male rivals. In order to
   disentangle whether the competitive tactics of flanged males correspond
   to scramble or contest competition in their long-distance communication
   system, we used an acoustic localization approach with a grid of
   recorders installed in the research are. We found that flanged males go
   to areas with much food and then engage in vocal, and subsequently,
   physical battles with rivals, probably because their relative strength
   fluctuates rapidly. We call this unusual form of contest competition
   confrontational assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation to local resource availability depends on responses in growth
   rate and nutrient acquisition. The growth rate hypothesis (GRH) suggests
   that growing fast should impair competitive abilities for phosphorus and
   nitrogen due to high demand for biosynthesis. However, in
   microorganisms, size influences both growth and uptake rates, which may
   mask trade-offs and instead generate a positive relationship between
   these traits (size hypothesis, SH). Here, we evolved a gradient of
   maximum growth rate (mu(max)) from a single bacterium ancestor to test
   the relationship among mu(max), competitive ability for nutrients and
   cell size, while controlling for evolutionary history. We found a strong
   positive correlation between mu(max) and competitive ability for
   phosphorus, associated with a trade-off between mu(max) and cell size:
   strains selected for high mu(max) were smaller and better competitors
   for phosphorus. Our results strongly support the SH, while the
   trade-offs expected under GRH were not apparent. Beyond plasticity,
   unicellular populations can respond rapidly to selection pressure
   through joint evolution of their size and maximum growth rate. Our study
   stresses that physiological links between these traits tightly shape the
   evolution of competitive strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The extent of inbreeding depression and the magnitude of
   heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFC) have been suggested to depend
   on the environmental context in which they are assayed, but little
   evidence is available for wild populations. We combine extensive
   molecular and capture-mark-recapture data from a blue tit (Cyanistes
   caeruleus) population to (1) analyze the relationship between
   heterozygosity and probability of interannual adult local recruitment
   and (2) test whether environmental stress imposed by physiologically
   suboptimal temperatures and rainfall influence the magnitude of HFC. To
   address these questions, we used two different arrays of microsatellite
   markers: 14 loci classified as neutral and 12 loci classified as
   putatively functional. We found significant relationships between
   heterozygosity and probability of interannual local recruitment that
   were most likely explained by variation in genomewide heterozygosity.
   The strength of the association between heterozygosity and probability
   of interannual local recruitment was positively associated with annual
   accumulated precipitation. Annual mean heterozygosity increased over
   time, which may have resulted from an overall positive selection on
   heterozygosity over the course of the study period. Finally, neutral and
   putatively functional loci showed similar trends, but the former had
   stronger effect sizes and seemed to better reflect genomewide
   heterozygosity. Overall, our results show that HFC can be context
   dependent, emphasizing the need to consider the role of environmental
   heterogeneity as a key factor when exploring the consequences of
   individual genetic diversity on fitness in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudoasterophyllites cretaceus from the Cenomanian of Bohemia was
   recently recognized as an angiosperm by association with stamens
   containing monosulcate pollen of the Tucanopollis type. New material
   indicates that the stamens were borne in short spikes, with each stamen
   subtended by a bract, whereas the carpels were solitary and contained a
   single pendent, orthotropous ovule. We have investigated the
   phylogenetic position of Pseudoasterophyllites by including it in a
   morphological analysis of extant angiosperms using backbone constraint
   trees that represent the current range of hypotheses on relationships of
   the five mesangiosperm Glades. With a backbone tree in which
   Chloranthaceae are linked with magnoliids and Ceratophyllum with
   eudicots, the most parsimonious position of Pseudoasterophyllites is
   sister to Chloranthaceae, but a sister-group relationship to
   Ceratophyllum is only one step less parsimonious. With a backbone tree
   in which Chloranthaceae and Ceratophyllum form a Glade,
   Pseudoasterophyllites is sister to Ceratophyllum, based on derived
   features shared with both Chloranthaceae and Ceratophyllum plus solitary
   female flowers (as in Ceratophyllum). Similar results are obtained when
   Pseudoasterophyllites is added to the analysis with other fossils
   inferred to be related to Chloranthaceae and/or Ceratophyllum. If the
   plants that produced Tucanopollis pollen in the Barremian-Aptian of
   Africa South America are related to Pseudoasterophyllites, these results
   suggest that Chloranthaceae and Ceratophyllum are relicts of one of the
   most important early radiations of angiosperms, which included not only
   colonizers of disturbed terrestrial habitats but also halophytes and
   aquatics.}},

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1514-1524}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Correlated data are ubiquitous in ecological and evolutionary
   research, and appropriate statistical analysis requires that these
   correlations are taken into account. For regressions with correlated,
   non-normal outcomes, twomain approaches are used: conditional and
   marginal modelling. The former leads to generalized linear mixed models
   (GLMMs), while the latter are estimated using generalized estimating
   equations (GEEs), or marginalized multilevel regression models.
   Differences, advantages and drawbacks of conditional and marginal models
   have been discussed extensively in the statistical and applied
   literature, and there is some agreement that the choice of the model
   must depend on the question under study. Yet, there still appears to be
   a lot of confusion and disagreement over when to choose which model.
   2. We start with a review of conditional and marginal models, and the
   differences in the interpretation of the resulting parameter estimates.
   We highlight that the two types of models propagate different linear
   relations between the covariates and the response. Moreover, while
   conditional models explicitly account for heterogeneity among clustered
   observations, marginal models yield averages over such heterogeneities
   and are therefore often interpreted as population-averaged models.
   3. We point out theoretically and with an example that when modelling
   non-normal outcomes no unambiguous definition of a marginal model
   generally exists. Instead, marginal model parameters are marginal only
   with respect to unaccounted differences among clusters and thus depend
   on the fixed effects in the model. Therefore, marginal model parameters
   should not be loosely interpreted as population-averaged parameters. In
   addition, we explain how marginal modelling is mathematically analogous
   to deliberately omitting covariates with explanatory power, and to
   deliberately introducing a Berkson measurement error into covariates. We
   also reiterate that marginal modelling is related to a well-known
   statistical phenomenon, the Simpson's paradox.
   4. In most cases, therefore, we regard the conditional model as the more
   powerful choice to explain how covariates are associated with a
   non-normal response. Still, marginal models can be useful, given that
   the scientific question explicitly requires such a model formulation.}},

Abstract = {{Exogenous and endogenous environmental factors can have simultaneous
   additive as well as interacting effects on life-history traits. Ignoring
   such interactions can lead to a biased understanding of variability in
   demographic rates and consequently population dynamics. These
   interactions have been the focus of decades-long debates on the
   mechanisms underlying small mammal population fluctuations. They have
   often been studied indirectly through seasonal effects, but studies
   considering them directly and more mechanistically are rare. We
   investigated the joint effects of exogenous (temperature, food
   availability) and endogenous (population density) factors on the
   demographic rates of a group-living diurnal rodent, the African striped
   mouse Rhabdomys pumilio using nine-year mark-recapture data from a
   population in the Succulent Karoo, South Africa. In general, higher
   temperatures and lower food availability were associated with higher
   survival, whereas high population densities were either beneficial or
   detrimental to survival depending on interacting food availability. High
   reproductive rates were related to lower temperatures, higher food
   availability and lower population density, and interactions among
   environmental factors mediated the strength of these relationships. Our
   study highlights the complex ways in which different environmental
   factors can interact to shape demographic rates and emphasizes the

Abstract = {{Invasive species are a serious threat to biodiversity worldwide and
   predicting whether an introduced species will first establish and then
   become invasive can be useful to preserve ecosystem services.
   Establishment is influenced by multiple factors, such as the
   interactions between the introduced individuals and the resident
   community, and demographic and environmental stochasticity. Field
   observations are often incomplete or biased. This, together with an
   imperfect knowledge of the ecological traits of the introduced species,
   makes the prediction of establishment challenging. Methods that consider
   the combined effects of these factors on our ability to predict the
   establishment of an introduced species are currently lacking. We develop
   an inference framework to assess the combined effects of demographic
   stochasticity and parameter uncertainty on our ability to predict the
   probability of establishment following the introduction of a small
   number of individuals. We find that even moderate levels of demographic
   stochasticity influence both the probability of establishment, and,
   crucially, our ability to correctly predict that probability. We also
   find that estimation of the demographic parameters of an introduced
   species is fundamental to obtain precise estimates of the interaction
   parameters. For typical values of demographic stochasticity, the drop in
   our ability to predict an establishment can be 30\% when having priors
   on the demographic parameters compared to having their accurate values.
   The results from our study illustrate how demographic stochasticity may
   bias the prediction of the probability of establishment. Our method can
   be applied to estimate probability of establishment of introduced
   species in field scenarios, where time series data and prior information
   on the demographic traits of the introduced species are available.}},

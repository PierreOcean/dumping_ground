Title = {{Interactive effects between plant functional types and soil factors on

Abstract = {{Plant communities are coupled with abiotic factors, as species diversity
   and community composition both respond to and influence climate and soil
   characteristics. Interactions between vegetation and abiotic factors
   depend on plant functional types (PFT) as different growth forms will
   have differential responses to and effects on site characteristics.
   However, despite the importance of different PFT for community assembly
   and ecosystem functioning, research has mainly focused on vascular
   plants. Here, we established a set of observational plots in two
   contrasting habitats in northeastern Siberia in order to assess the
   relationship between species diversity and community composition with
   soil variables, as well as the relationship between vegetation cover and
   species diversity for two PFT (nonvascular and vascular). We found that
   nonvascular species diversity decreased with soil acidity and moisture
   and, to a lesser extent, with soil temperature and active layer
   thickness. In contrast, no such correlation was found for vascular
   species diversity. Differences in community composition were found
   mainly along soil acidity and moisture gradients. However, the
   proportion of variation in composition explained by the measured soil
   variables was much lower for nonvascular than for vascular species when
   considering the PFT separately. We also found different relationships
   between vegetation cover and species diversity according the PFT and
   habitat. In support of niche differentiation theory, species diversity
   and community composition were related to edaphic factors. The distinct
   relationships found for nonvascular and vascular species suggest the
   importance of considering multiple PFT when assessing species diversity
   and composition and their interaction with edaphic factors. Synthesis:
   Identifying vegetation responses to edaphic factors is a first step
   toward a better understanding of vegetation-soil feedbacks under climate
   change. Our results suggest that incorporating differential responses of
   PFT is important for predicting vegetation shifts, primary productivity,
   and in turn, ecosystem functioning in a c hanging climate.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major potential consequences of climate change is damage to
   earth's ecosystems, damage which could manifest itself in the form of
   tipping risks. We establish an economic growth model of ecosystem
   tipping risks, set in the context of possible forest dieback. We
   consider different specifications of impacts arising from the forest
   dieback tipping point, specifications such as changes in the system
   dynamics of the forests, changes in the forest mass, and impacts on
   economic output. We also consider endogenous and exogenous tipping point
   probabilities. For each specification we compute the optimal policies
   for forest management and emission control. Our results show qualitative
   differences in patterns of post-tipping event, optimal forest harvest,
   and either precautionary or aggressive pre-tipping event harvest
   patterns, a feature consistent with the findings of the existing
   literature. Optimal control of deforestation and carbon dioxide emission
   reduction also exhibits varied patterns of post- and pre-tipping levels
   depending on the nature of the tipping risk. Still, today's optimal
   policy is one of more stringent emissions control in presence of a
   potential forest dieback tipping point.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Determinations of the lowest colon dose, D (min), below which there is a
   statistically significant excess relative risk of all solid cancer, when
   analyses are restricted to the range {[}0, D (min)], are of current
   interest in research related to radiation protection and risk
   assessment. In reviewing recent cancer mortality reports on the Life
   Span Study (LSS) of Japanese A-bomb survivors, reported D (min) values
   were found to vary between different reports. The report 12 (follow-up:
   1950-1990) found a D (min) of 50 mGy, but the most recent report 14
   (follow-up: 1950-2003) found a D (min) of 200 mGy. There were small
   dosimetry changes between report 12, which used DS86, and report 14,
   which used DS02, but these changes are unlikely to account for a
   difference in D (min) of a factor of 4. This short communication
   examines the reasons for this difference in D (min) by presenting
   further investigations into D (min) using different trial values for D
   (min) and various follow-up time spans, all with the same DS02
   dosimetry. Magnitudes of the low-dose risks in different dose ranges are
   also presented. It is shown here that the main influence on D (min)
   comes from the length of follow-up and a D (min) of 50 mGy may also be
   obtained with the most recent LSS mortality data and DS02, if a
   restricted follow-up is analyzed. A systematic trend was evident of
   lower D (min) values for earlier mortality follow-up periods, consistent
   with information from earlier LSS reports. Although it may seem
   surprising that the D (min) increases with longer follow-up and better
   statistics, this systematic trend appears to be a consequence of
   decreasing mortality risks with longer follow-up, even though the error
   bars on the risks are getting smaller with increasing follow-up. These
   systematic trends also persisted after accounting for differences
   between baseline cancer rates for two groups of survivors who were
   either proximal or distal to the A-bomb hypocenter. Similar systematic
   trends, although much less pronounced, were also found in the LSS cancer
   incidence data. Some evidence is provided here that results on low-dose
   radiation risks from earlier follow-up periods should not be ignored by
   radiation protection authorities, once the results from the new extended
   follow-ups are published. This is because of the possibility that the
   new data for extended follow-up beyond a certain calendar time, which
   pertain to very long times since exposure, may be contributing to an
   overall reduction in radiation related risks per unit dose compared to
   analogous risks determined from earlier follow-up periods, because of
   the risk effect modification of time since exposure.}},

Journal = {{TRANSNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Many multilateral environmental agreements have adopted differentiated
   rules for different countries, based on the recognition of the common
   but differentiated responsibilities' (CBDRs) of states. By establishing
   two rigid groups of countries with and without emissions reduction
   obligations, the intergovernmental climate regime represents the most
   extreme case of such differentiation. The regime has struggled to
   overcome this rigidity and the resulting political deadlock between
   developing and developed countries. Transnational climate governance
   (TCG) initiatives have emerged as an alternative to provide mitigation,
   adaptation or finance outside the multilateral process. By drawing on
   synergies between public and private actors, it is hoped that they
   overcome the paralysis of the intergovernmental process. Yet, they take
   place in the same world of unequal peers, with different levels of
   capacity and responsibility for climate change. This article
   investigates the extent to which such TCG initiatives reflect the CBDR
   principle. Do different types of initiative - involving different types
   of actor or with different climate-related goals - address
   differentiation in distinct ways? Does taking account of CBDRs affect
   the membership of transnational initiatives? This article explores these
   questions empirically by analyzing a sample of TCG initiatives in terms
   of how they include differential treatment of states and non-state
   members. It concludes that TCG initiatives address differentiation in a
   pragmatic way. Most frequently, they either offer participants
   flexibility in how to implement their commitments, or provide support to
   members from developing countries. Such support is, so far, still
   insufficient to address the limited involvement of developing country
   actors.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature is known to influence ecosystem processes through its direct
   effect on biological rates such as respiration and nutrient cycling.
   These changes can then indirectly affect ecologically processes by
   altering trophic dynamics, the persistence of a species in a given
   environment, and, consequently, its distribution. However, it is not
   known if this direct effect of temperature on biological rates is
   singularly the most important factor for the functioning of ecosystems,
   or if trophic structure and the adaptation of a species to the local
   environment also play an essential role. Understanding the relative
   importance of these factors is crucial for predicting the impact that
   climate change will have on species and ecosystems. To achieve a more
   complete understanding of the impact of changing temperatures, it is
   necessary to integrate perspectives from biogeography, such as the
   influences of species distribution and local adaptation, with ecosystem
   and community ecology. By using the microbial community inhabiting the
   water-filled leaves of Sarracenia purpurea, we tested the importance of
   temperature, trophic structure, and local adaptation on ecosystem
   functioning. We accomplished this by collecting communities along a
   natural temperature gradient and maintaining these communities in a
   common garden, factorial experiment. To test for the importance of local
   adaptation and temperature, the origin of each community was crossed
   with the temperature from each site. Additionally, to test the
   importance of top-down trophic regulation for ecosystem functioning, the
   presence of the mosquito larvae top predator was manipulated. We found
   that temperature has a greater effect on ecosystem functioning than
   origin, and that top-down trophic regulation increased with temperature.
   Our results emphasize the synergistic effects of temperature and biotic
   interactions when predicting the consequences of global warming on
   ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{For migratory species, the timing of arrival at breeding grounds is an
   important determinant of fitness. Too early arrival at the breeding
   ground is associated with various costs, and we focus on one
   understudied cost: that migrants can experience a higher risk of
   predation if arriving earlier than the bulk of the breeding population.
   We show, using both a semi-analytic and simulation model, that predation
   can select for later arrival. This is because of safety in numbers:
   predation risk becomes diluted if many other individuals, either con-or
   heterospecific, are already residing in the area. Predation risk
   dilution can also select for more synchronous arrival because deviating
   from the current population-wide norm to earlier or later dates leads to
   higher predation risk or to failures in territory acquisition,
   respectively. The fact that selection for high arrival synchrony can in
   some cases be more important than selection for a specific date (early
   or late) within the season is an example of an `evolutionary priority
   effect': whichever strategy - in this case a particular arrival time -
   becomes established in a population can remain stable over long periods
   of time; there are many possible equilibria (multiple stable states)
   which the population can remain at. Mixed arrival strategies are also
   possible under some circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that ecosystem functioning is positively influenced by
   biodiversity. Most biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments have
   measured biodiversity based on species richness or phylogenetic
   relationships. However, theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that
   ecosystem functioning should be more closely related to functional
   diversity than to species richness. We applied different metrics of
   biodiversity in an artificial biodiversity-ecosystem functioning
   experiment using 64 species of green microalgae in combinations of two
   to 16 species. We found that phylogenetic and functional diversity were
   positively correlated with biomass overyield, driven by their strong
   correlation with species richness. At low species richness, no
   significant correlation between overyield and functional and
   phylogenetic diversity was found. However, at high species richness (16
   species), we found a positive relationship of overyield with functional
   diversity and a negative relationship with phylogenetic diversity. We
   show that negative phylogenetic diversity-ecosystem functioning
   relationships can result from interspecific growth inhibition. The
   opposing performances of facilitation (functional diversity) and
   inhibition (phylogenetic diversity) we observed at the 16 species level
   suggest that phylogenetic diversity is not always a good proxy for
   functional diversity and that results from experiments with low species
   numbers may underestimate negative species interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Recombination is an important source of metabolic innovation, especially
   in prokaryotes, which have evolved the ability to survive on many
   different sources of chemical elements and energy. Metabolic systems
   have a well-understood genotype-phenotype relationship, which permits a
   quantitative and biochemically principled understanding of how
   recombination creates novel phenotypes. Here, we investigate the power
   of recombination to create genome-scale metabolic reaction networks that
   enable an organism to survive in new chemical environments. To this end,
   we use flux balance analysis, an experimentally validated computational
   method that can predict metabolic phenotypes from metabolic genotypes.
   We show that recombination is much more likely to create novel metabolic
   abilities than random changes in chemical reactions of a metabolic
   network. We also find that phenotypic innovation is more likely when
   recombination occurs between parents that are genetically closely
   related, phenotypically highly diverse, and viable on few rather than
   many carbon sources. Survival on a new carbon source preferentially
   involves reactions that are superessential, that is, essential in many
   metabolic networks. We validate our observations with data from 61
   reconstructed prokaryotic metabolic networks. Our systematic and
   quantitative analysis of metabolic systems helps understand how
   recombination creates innovation.}},

Title = {{Phylogenetic placement of Psilopeganum, a rare monotypic genus of
   Rutaceae (the citrus family) endemic to China}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{Psilopeganum (Rutaceae) is a rare monotypic genus endemic to the
   vicinity of the Yangtze River valley in Chongqing, Hubei, Sichuan and
   Guizhou provinces in China. It differs from most Rutaceae taxa by its
   herbaceous habit and has been treated as a member of the tribe Ruteae.
   Our study is the first attempt to place Psilopeganum in a phylogenetic
   context and our results show that the genus belongs to a clade with
   Boenninghausenia, Ruta and Thamnosma, which are part of Ruteae. Within
   this group, the position of Psilopeganum remains unclear because the
   Boenninghausenia-Thamnosma clade, Psilopeganum and Ruta form a
   trichotomy in most analyses. The ITS dataset placed Psilopeganum as
   sister to the Mediterranean and Canarian genus Ruta, which is
   corroborated by morphological similarities. Our studies support that
   Ruteae is paraphyletic with respect to Aurantioideae and that Dictamnus
   does not belong to Ruteae. The Indian, Sri Lankan, and Malagasy genus
   Chloroxylon is sister to the
   Boenninghausenia-Psilopeganum-Ruta-Thamnosma clade, despite its
   traditional placement in the subfamily Flindersioideae. The placement of
   Chloroxylon is consistent with an origin of the group of Chloroxylon,
   Boenninghausenia, Psilopeganum, Ruta and Thamnosma in southern Asia. The
   rapid uplifts of the Himalayas could account for one or two vicariance
   events splitting the lineages of the
   Boenninghausenia-Psilopeganum-Ruta-Thamnosma clade, and may explain the
   short branch length and low support for the relationships among
   Psilopeganum, Ruta, and the Boenninghausenia-Thamnosma clade.}},

Abstract = {{A flower from the early Cenomanian of northeastern Maryland, Cecilanthus
   polymerus gen. et sp. nov., is described using SEM and synchrotron X-ray
   microtomography. The flower has >20 strap-shaped tepals, ca. 50
   spatulate stamens with embedded adaxial pollen sacs and possibly
   H-valvate dehiscence, and ca. 100 more-or-less plicate carpels. Floral
   phyllotaxis is whorled, with >10 parts per whorl, but slightly
   irregular. Pollen and ovules are not preserved, but locule shape
   suggests that the carpels are uniovulate. Similar characters occur in
   extant Magnoliales and the basal ANITA grade, but never in combination.
   In an attempt to resolve these ambiguities, we performed morphological
   phylogenetic analyses, with the arrangement of extant taxa constrained
   to trees based primarily on molecular data. With anther dehiscence and
   ovule number treated as unknown, Cecilanthus has several
   most-parsimonious positions: nested in Nymphaeales, nested in
   Magnoliales, sister to Laurales, and sister to Chloranthaceae. However,
   scoring anther dehiscence as H-valvate and ovule number as = 1,
   increases support for a position in Magnoliales. Cecilanthus
   demonstrates that the early radiation of angiosperms produced floral
   morphotypes unlike those in any surviving taxa, and it illustrates the
   value of characters such as pollen morphology and seed anatomy for
   phylogenetic placement of floral mesofossils.}},

Abstract = {{A Fourier spectral analysis of daily discharge time series over the last
   century in 79 unregulated catchments in Sweden reveals a significant
   gradual steepening of the discharge power spectrum slope over time.
   Where historical meteorological observations are available (the 41
   southernmost catchments), the results of our analyses indicate that
   local land use changes within the catchments have affected discharge
   power spectra to a greater extent than have changes in precipitation
   patterns. 1-D distributed routing analysis based on current and
   historical maps and scenario modeling in the Tornestorp Catchment
   suggests that changes in stream network properties have led to increases
   in the hydraulic Peclet number (Pe) and subsequent decreases in the
   discharge power spectrum over short periods. The analysis displays
   analytically how a change in stream network properties can result in
   changes in the power spectra, where the relative importance of the
   geomorphological and hydrodynamic dispersion effects determines the
   shape of the streamflow response. The lowering of the discharge power
   spectrum over short periods observed for many Swedish catchments is
   likely caused by increasing Pe (a decrease in dispersion) over time,
   resulting in higher peak values, especially for rapid streamflow
   responses (i.e., over short periods), demonstrated empirically for the
   Tornestorp case study. The finding that the discharge power spectrum can
   change significantly over time highlights the need for hydrological
   models to account for the effect of the nonstationarity of parameters
   that result from temporal change caused by land use change and/or
   climate change that is due to anthropogenic or natural causes.}},

Journal = {{PHYTOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{50-59}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Several spermidine alkaloids are described in literature as constituents
   of the root bark of Capparis decidua. Since some of the proposed
   structures, however, are in conflict with the expected biosynthetic
   paths, an extract of the root bark of the plant was re-investigated.
   Four major spermidine alkaloids of the codonocarpine type were
   identified and their structures elucidated: of the four compounds,
   iso-codonocarpine was described previously for C. decidua and cadabicine
   was proposed as a possible constituent as well. Codonocarpine was found
   for the first time in an extract of C. decidua but was previously
   isolated from a closely related plant. Capparidisinine, finally, is an
   alkaloid with a structure that has never been described before. The
   structures of the four alkaloids are substantiated by NMR and MS data,
   and the four compounds are in logical agreement with biosynthetic
   considerations: they would arise from alpha,omega-bis-adducts of
   spermidine with coumaric and/or ferulic acids, followed by phenol
   oxidation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   have not been systematically investigated for mountain areas. This paper
   analyzes the status of knowledge from natural science disciplines and
   research needs relevant to the national and subnational climate
   adaptation policies of 1 US state (Washington) and 7 countries (Austria,
   Bhutan, Colombia, Germany, Nepal, Peru, and Switzerland), in particular
   the elements of those policies focused on mountain areas. In addition,
   we asked key individuals involved in drafting those policies to answer a
   short questionnaire. We found that research needs mainly concern impact
   and vulnerability assessments at regional and local levels, integrated
   assessments, and improved climate and socioeconomic data. These needs
   are often related to the challenges to data coverage and model
   performance in mountainous areas. In these areas, the base data are
   often riddled with gaps and uncertainties, making it particularly
   difficult to formulate adaptation strategies. In countries where data
   coverage is less of an issue, there is a tendency to explore
   quantitative forms of impact and vulnerability assessments. We highlight
   how the knowledge embedded in natural science disciplines is not always
   useful to address complex vulnerabilities in coupled human and natural
   systems and briefly refer to alternative pathways to adaptation in the
   form of no-regret, flexible, and adaptive management solutions. Finally,
   in recognition of the trans-and interdisciplinary nature of climate
   change adaptation, we raise the question of which knowledge production
   paradigms are best able to deliver sustainable adaptations to growing
   environmental stressors in mountain regions.}},

Abstract = {{Whole genome sequences, which can be provided even for non-model
   organisms owing to high-throughput sequencers, are valuable in enhancing
   the understanding of adaptive evolution. Metrosideros polymorpha, a tree
   species endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, occupies a wide range of
   ecological habitats and shows remarkable polymorphism in phenotypes
   among/within populations. The biological functions of genetic variations
   observed within this species could provide significant insights into the
   adaptive radiation found in a single species. Here de novo assembled
   genome sequences of M. polymorpha are presented to reveal basic genomic
   parameters about this species and to develop our knowledge of ecological
   divergences. The assembly yielded 304-Mbp genome sequences, half of
   which were covered by 19 scaffolds with > 5 Mbp, and contained 30 K
   protein-coding genes. Demographic history inferred from the genome-wide
   heterozygosity indicated that this species experienced a dramatic rise
   and fall in the effective population size, possibly owing to past
   geographic or climatic changes in the Hawaiian Islands. This M.
   polymorpha genome assembly represents a high-quality genome resource
   useful for future functional analyses of both intra- and interspecies
   genetic variations or comparative genomics.}},

Abstract = {{Female extra-pair reproduction in socially monogamous systems is
   predicted to cause cuckolded socially-paired males to conditionally
   reduce paternal care, causing selection against extra-pair reproduction
   and underlying polyandry. However, existing models and empirical studies
   have not explicitly considered that cuckolded males might be related to
   their socially-paired female and/or to her extra-pair mate, and
   therefore be related to extra-pair offspring that they did not sire but
   could rear. Selection against paternal care, and hence against
   extra-pair reproduction, might then be weakened. We derive metrics that
   quantify allele-sharing between within-pair and extra-pair offspring and
   their mother and her socially-paired male in terms of coefficients of
   kinship and inbreeding. We use song sparrow (Melospiza melodia)
   paternity and pedigree data to quantify these metrics, and thereby
   quantify the joint effects of extra-pair reproduction and inbreeding on
   a brood's total allelic value to its socially-paired parents. Cuckolded
   male song sparrows were almost always detectably related to extra-pair
   offspring they reared. Consequently, although brood allelic value
   decreased substantially following female extra-pair reproduction, this
   decrease was reduced by within-pair and extra-pair reproduction among
   relatives. Such complex variation in kinship within nuclear families
   should be incorporated into models considering coevolutionary dynamics
   of extra-pair reproduction, parental care, and inbreeding.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we examine the effect of sample size on spatial data
   quality in participatory mapping for assessing past land use. Using a
   map-based questionnaire, we capture changes in the extent and location
   of arable farmland 20 years ago. We then compare the results of the
   participatory mapping with reference data from the literature and
   accordingly calculate quality measures based on notions of correctness
   and completeness. In our data, correctness is high only for areas marked
   by many participants; the completeness metric increases as a function of
   the total area delineated by the participants. These data quality
   metrics then are analysed for subsamples, which are computed through
   leave-p-out jackknifing from our sample. This cross-validation addresses
   the question as to whether our data would be considered correct and
   complete having had included fewer participants. We present evidence
   that a small number of participants - in our case, less than 10 -
   already yield high-quality data. Further, we can demonstrate that
   aggregating the data from those participants with highest individual
   data quality values does not generate the best data quality as a group.
   This work provides a contribution to the use of participatory mapping
   for gathering correct and complete data.}},

Title = {{A Modified Reverse One-Hybrid Screen Identifies Transcriptional
   Activation Domains in PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 3}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{Transcriptional activation domains (TADs) are difficult to predict and
   identify, since they are not conserved and have little consensus. Here,
   we describe a yeast-based screening method that is able to identify
   individual amino acid residues involved in transcriptional activation in
   a high throughput manner. A plant transcriptional activator, PIF3
   (phytochrome interacting factor 3), was fused to the yeast
   GAL4-DNA-binding Domain (BD), driving expression of the URA3 (Orotidine
   5'-phosphate decarboxylase) reporter, and used for negative selection on
   5-fluroorotic acid (5FOA). Randomly mutagenized variants of PIF3 were
   then selected for a loss or reduction in transcriptional activation
   activity by survival on FOA. In the process, we developed a strategy to
   eliminate false positives from negative selection that can be used for
   both reverse-1- and 2-hybrid screens. With this method we were able to
   identify two distinct regions in PIF3 with transcriptional activation
   activity, both of which are functionally conserved in PIF1, PIF4, and
   PIF5. Both are collectively necessary for full PIF3 transcriptional
   activity, but neither is sufficient to induce transcription
   autonomously. We also found that the TAD appear to overlap physically
   with other PIF3 functions, such as phyB binding activity and consequent
   phosphorylation. Our protocol should provide a valuable tool for
   identifying, analyzing and characterizing novel TADs in eukaryotic
   transcription factors, and thus potentially contribute to the unraveling
   of the mechanism underlying transcriptional activation.}},

Abstract = {{Gene PmAF7DS confers resistance to wheat powdery mildew (isolate
   Bgt\#211 ); it was mapped to a 14.6-cM interval ( Xgwm350 a- Xbarc184 )
   on chromosome 7DS. The flanking markers could be applied in MAS
   breeding.
   Wheat powdery mildew (Pm) is caused by the biotrophic pathogen Blumeria
   graminis tritici (DC.) (Bgt). An ongoing threat of breakdown of
   race-specific resistance to Pm requires a continuous effort to discover
   new alleles in the wheat gene pool. Developing new cultivars with
   improved disease resistance is an economically and environmentally safe
   approach to reduce yield losses. To identify and characterize genes for
   resistance against Pm in bread wheat we used the (Arina x Forno) RILs
   population. Initially, the two parental lines were screened with a
   collection of 61 isolates of Bgt from Israel. Three Pm isolates Bgt\#210
   , Bgt\#211 and Bgt\#213 showed differential reactions in the parents:
   Arina was resistant (IT = 0), whereas Forno was moderately susceptible
   (IT = -3). Isolate Bgt\#211 was then used to inoculate the RIL
   population. The segregation pattern of plant reactions among the RILs
   indicates that a single dominant gene controls the conferred resistance.
   A genetic map of the region containing this gene was assembled with DNA
   markers and assigned to the 7D physical bin map. The gene, temporarily
   designated PmAF7DS, was located in the distal region of chromosome arm
   7DS. The RILs were also inoculated with Bgt\#210 and Bgt\#213. The plant
   reactions to these isolates showed high identity with the reaction to
   Bgt\#211, indicating the involvement of the same gene or closely linked,
   but distinct single genes. The genomic location of PmAF7DS, in light of
   other Pm genes on 7DS is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Initial plant diversity might control subsequent community assembly
   processes and plant productivity. To study these effects, we used a
   biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment) with subplots of different
   sown diversity that were never weeded and spontaneously colonized
   control plots of different size (3.5 x 3.5 m, 20 x 20 m) with and
   without mowing in an 8-year study. On non-sown bare plots without
   mowing, colonizer accumulation depended on plot size resulting in a loss
   of diversity in large, undisturbed (unmown) control plots after initial
   colonization. On sown plots that were mown, species richness converged
   to high levels due to the accumulation of internal colonists (species
   belonging to the experimental pool of sown species), while initially
   high species richness of external colonists (species not belonging to
   the experimental pool) and residents (species sown on the plot) declined
   over time. The convergence of total species richness at higher levels
   was paralleled by increased taxonomic (Simpson index, Q(simp)),
   phylogenetic (Q(phylo)) and trait (FDQ) diversity, whereby FDQ was
   greatest on plots with low resident species richness after several
   years. Rates of change in terms of species colonization and extinction
   decelerated over time irrespective of resident species richness, mowing
   or plot size. While the contribution of residents declined and that of
   colonists increased, community biomass production did not change over
   time. The biomasses of residents and colonists were greatest at higher
   levels of species richness, partial Q(phylo) and FDQ of the respective
   species group, but community biomass was consistently weakly related to
   total species richness and diversity indices. Our study shows that in
   contrast to the period of succession, ``mature{''} plant communities
   resulting from natural assembly processes, favouring the coexistence of
   multiple species and thus high biodiversity, do no longer show
   significant relationships between species richness and variables related
   to ecosystem functioning such as primary productivity. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Climate change is known to have a profound influence on plant
   reproduction, mainly because it affects plant/pollinator interactions,
   sometimes driving plants to extinction. Starting from the Neogene, the
   European climate was subjected to severe alterations. Nevertheless,
   several genera, including Berardia, survived these climatic changes.
   Despite the numerous studies performed about the relationship between
   climate change and plant reproductive biology, equivalent studies on
   ancient species are lacking, even though they may furnish crucial
   information on the strategies that allowed them to survive drastic
   climatic fluctuations. We investigated floral and reproductive features
   in Berardia subacaulis (Asteraceae), describing pollen vectors,
   capitulum and florets phenology, evaluating reproductive efficiency and
   defining the reproductive mode of the plant with bagging experiments and
   test of apomixis. B. subacaulis grows in habitats with low pollination
   services; it is self-compatible, but many typical features favouring
   cross-pollination are still present: florets are characterized by
   incomplete protandry, capitulum protogyny and high pollen-ovule ratio.
   The plant is not apomictic and self-fertilization is allowed within each
   capitulum. Similarly to other European Alpine endemics supposed to
   belong to the Mediterranean ancient tropical flora, the reproductive
   mode observed in the monospecific genus Berardia assured reproduction
   also under a pollinator decline. Differently from the other endemics, it
   took advantage of its spontaneous self-pollination and compatibility and
   its generalist pollination service, common both among high altitude
   plants and in the Asteraceae.}},

Abstract = {{Computed tomography represents the gold standard in forensic and
   palaeopathological diagnosis. However, the X-rays used may affect the
   DNA quality through fragmentation and loss of genetic information.
   Previous work showed that the effects of ionizing radiation on dry DNA
   are non-significant with P < 10(-8), which cannot be detected by means
   of polymerase chain reaction methods. In the present paper, complete
   analytical model that characterizes radiation effects on fragmented DNA
   in dry, wet, and frozen states is described. Simulation of radiation
   tracks in water phantom cells was performed using the Geant4-DNA
   toolkit. Cell hits by electrons with energies between 5 and 20 keV were
   simulated, and the formation of radiolytic products was assessed at a
   temperature of 298 K. The diffusion coefficient and the mean square
   displacement of reactive species were calculated by
   Stokes-Einstein-Smoluchowski relations at 273 K. Finally, DNA fragment
   damage was estimated using the density distribution of fragments
   calculated from atomic force microscopy images. The lowest probability
   of radiation-induced DNA damage was observed for dry state, with a range
   from 2.5 x 10(-9) to 7.8 x 10(-12) at 298 K, followed by that for frozen
   state, with a range from 0.9 to 4 x 10(-7) at 273 K. The highest
   probability of radiation-induced DNA damage was demonstrated for
   fragmented DNA in wet state with a range from 2 to 9 x 10(-7) at 298 K.
   These results significantly improve the interpretation of CT imaging in
   future studies in forensic and palaeopathological science.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{220-234}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The Uummannaq region is a mosaic of glacial landsystems, consistent with
   hypothesized landscape distribution resulting from variations in
   subglacial thermal regime. The region is dominated by selective linear
   erosion that has spatially and altitudinally partitioned the landscape.
   Low altitude areas are dominated by glacial scour and higher elevations
   are dominated by plateaux or mountain valley and cirque glaciers. The
   appearance and nature of each landscape type varies locally with
   altitude and latitude, as a function of bedrock geology and average
   glacial conditions. Selective linear erosion has been a primary control
   on landscape distribution throughout Uummannaq, leading to plateau
   formation and the growth of a coalescent fjord system in the Uummannaq
   region. This has allowed the development of the Uummannaq ice stream's
   (UIS) onset zone during glacial periods. Fjord development has been
   enhanced by a downstream change in geology to less-resistant
   lithologies, increasing erosional efficiency and allowing a single
   glacial channel to develop, encouraging glacier convergence and the
   initiation of ice streaming. The landscape has been affected by several
   periods of regional uplift from 33Ma to present, and has been subject to
   subsequent fluvial and glacial erosion. Uplift has removed surfaces from
   the impact of widespread warm-based glaciation, leaving them as relict
   landsurfaces. The result of this is a regional altitude-dependent
   continuum of glacial modification, with extreme differences in erosion
   between high and low elevation surfaces. This study indicates that
   processes of long-term uplift, glacial erosion/protection and spatial
   variability in erosion intensity have produced a highly partitioned
   landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Botanists and plant morphologists have long been fascinated by how
   certain species can exhibit such reduced morphologies that even their
   identification to genus- or family-level becomes difficult. Such was the
   case with Lysipomia mitsyae sp. nov., an exceptionally small plant
   discovered in the Peruvian Andes which bears lobelioid characteristics
   but differs in size by an order of magnitude from the current smallest
   members known from the entire Campanulaceae and lacks diagnostic
   characters allowing it to be reliably placed to genus-level. Molecular
   analyses of trnL-F, composed of a representative Lobelioideae sampling,
   place the samples within the genus Lysipomia, requiring that amendments
   be made to the description of the genus. Supplementary ITS analyses of a
   representative generic sampling indicate a close relationship to
   Lysipomia sphagnophila and L. multiflora. We here describe the world's
   smallest Campanulaceae, Lysipomia mitsyae sp. nov., and discuss its
   phylogenetic and systematic relationships to the other members of the
   genus. Its highly reduced morphology, which has given it status as the
   smallest Campanulaceae and, quite possibly, the world's smallest
   eudicot, is discussed in the light of current knowledge on the
   physiological and anatomical constraints on alpine plant growth and
   survival.}},

Abstract = {{Homomorphic self-incompatibility is a well-studied example of a
   physiological process that is thought to increase population diversity
   and reduce the expression of inbreeding depression. Whereas theoretical
   models predict the presence of a large number of S-haplotypes with equal
   frequencies at equilibrium, unequal allele frequencies have been
   repeatedly reported and attributed to sampling effects, population
   structure, demographic perturbation, sheltered deleterious mutations or
   selection pressure on linked genes. However, it is unclear to what
   extent unequal segregations are the results of gametophytic or sexual
   selection. Although these two forces are difficult to disentangle,
   testing S-alleles in the offspring of controlled crosses provides an
   opportunity to separate these two phenomena. In this work, segregation
   and transmission of S-alleles have been characterized in progenies of
   mixed donors and fully compatible pollinations under field conditions in
   Prunus avium. Seed set patterns and pollen performance have also been
   characterized. The results reveal paternal-specific distorted
   transmission of S-alleles in most of the crosses. Interestingly,
   S-allele segregation within any given paternal or maternal S-locus was
   random. Observations on pollen germination, pollen tube growth rate,
   pollen tube cohort size, seed set dynamics and transmission patterns
   strongly suggest post-pollination, prezygotic sexual selection, with
   male-male competition as the most likely mechanism. According to these
   results, post-pollination sexual selection takes precedence over
   frequency-dependent selection in explaining unequal S-haplotype
   frequencies.}},

   courses of understory NDVI to understory NDVI values measured in
   different types of forests distributed along a wide latitudinal gradient
   (65.12 degrees N-31.35 degrees N). Our results indicated that the
   retrieval method performs well particularly over open forests of
   different types. We also demonstrated the limitations of the method for
   closed canopies, where the understory signal retrieval is much
   attenuated.}},

Title = {{Radiation risk models for all solid cancers other than those types of

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{In the assessment of health risks after nuclear accidents, some health
   consequences require special attention. For example, in their 2013
   report on health risk assessment after the Fukushima nuclear accident,
   the World Health Organisation (WHO) panel of experts considered risks of
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer and leukaemia. For these specific cancer
   types, use was made of already published excess relative risk (ERR) and
   excess absolute risk (EAR) models for radiation-related cancer incidence
   fitted to the epidemiological data from the Japanese A-bomb Life Span
   Study (LSS). However, it was also considered important to assess all
   other types of solid cancer together and the WHO, in their
   above-mentioned report, stated ``No model to calculate the risk for all
   other solid cancer excluding breast and thyroid cancer risks is
   available from the LSS data{''}. Applying the LSS models for all solid
   cancers along with the models for the specific sites means that some
   cancers have an overlap in the risk evaluations. Thus, calculating the
   total solid cancer risk plus the breast cancer risk plus the thyroid
   cancer risk can overestimate the total risk by several per cent.
   Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to publish the required models
   for all other solid cancers, i.e. all solid cancers other than those
   types of cancer requiring special attention after a nuclear accident.
   The new models presented here have been fitted to the same LSS data set
   from which the risks provided by the WHO were derived. Although it is
   known already that the EAR and ERR effect modifications by sex are
   statistically significant for the outcome ``all solid cancer{''}, it is
   shown here that sex modification is not statistically significant for
   the outcome ``all solid cancer other than thyroid and breast cancer{''}.
   It is also shown here that the sex-averaged solid cancer risks with and
   without the sex modification are very similar once breast and thyroid
   cancers are factored out. Some other notable model differences between
   those already published for all solid cancers and those presented here
   for all other solid cancers are also given here. The models presented
   here can be used to improve on the methodology adopted by WHO after
   Fukushima and could contribute to emergency preparedness for future
   nuclear accidents.}},

Title = {{Root Exudates as Integral Part of Belowground Plant Defence}},
Booktitle = {{BELOWGROUND DEFENCE STRATEGIES IN PLANTS}},
Series = {{Signaling and Communication in Plants}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{45-67}},
Abstract = {{Root exudates comprise a heterogeneous group of compounds that display
   various effects on soilborne organisms, including stimulation,
   attraction, but also repellence and inhibition. Therefore, root-secreted
   chemicals can assist belowground plant defence through direct and/or
   indirect mechanisms. Direct defence strategies exploited by roots
   include the secretion of phytochemicals with antimicrobial, insecticide,
   or nematicide properties. In contrast, other root exudates recruit or
   influence beneficial organisms to serve as biological weapons against
   plant aggressors, a mechanism termed indirect plant defence. Since
   rhizosecretion fundamentally shapes the composition of soil-inhabiting
   organisms and contributes to plant survival, the quality and quantity of
   defence root exudates are tightly controlled. Various environmental and
   endogenous factors can stimulate the release of phytochemicals that
   exhibit precisely targeted bioactivities. On the molecular level,
   several primary active transport proteins have been demonstrated to
   affect the composition of defence root exudates in the rhizosphere. In
   this chapter, we will focus our attention on direct and indirect defence
   strategies mediated by root exudates. In addition, we will shed light on
   regulatory mechanisms of defence-related root exudation that prevent
   belowground disease and ensure optimal plant performance.}},

Abstract = {{A cold hanging glacier located on the south face of the Grandes Jorasses

   also confirmed that surface displacements experienced a power law
   acceleration along with superimposed log-periodic oscillations prior to
   the final rupture. This paper describes the methods used to achieve a

Title = {{Regional patterns and controlling factors in plant species composition
   and diversity in Canadian lowland coastal bogs and laggs}},
Journal = {{MIRES AND PEAT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Abstract = {{Inventories of natural assemblages of plant species are critical when
   planning ecological restoration of bogs. However, little is known about
   the regional variation in plant communities at the margins (laggs) of
   bogs, even though they are an integral element of raised bog ecosystems.
   Therefore, we investigated the regional patterns in the plant
   communities of bogs and laggs, and the factors that control them, for
   thirteen bogs in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Species richness was
   significantly higher in the bogs and laggs of the cooler, wetter Pacific
   Oceanic wetland region. Beta Diversity analyses showed that bogs in the
   Pacific Oceanic wetland region often shared species with their
   respective laggs, whereas half of the laggs in the warmer, drier Pacific
   Temperate wetland region had no species in common with the adjacent bogs
   and were thus more ecologically distinct from the bog. Primary climatic
   variables, such as mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature
   and latitude, as well as climate-influenced variables, such as pH, peat
   depth, and Na+ concentrations were the main correlates of plant species
   composition in the studied bogs. Site-specific factors, particularly
   depth to water table, and fraction of inorganic material in peat
   samples, were as strongly related to lagg plant communities as climate,
   while hydrochemistry appeared to have less influence.}},

Abstract = {{Local residents of the Lhasa River Region (LRR) on the Qinghai-Tibetan
   Plateau in western China have noticed that the surrounding mountains
   have appeared conspicuously green since the 1980s. To verify these
   claims, we investigated trends of grassland activities in the LRR from
   1982 to 2013 by using remotely sensed Normalised Difference Vegetation
   Index (NDVI) data, as a proxy for photosynthetic activity. Due to the
   limitation of available remote sensing data, we used long-term data with
   low resolution, GIMMS3 g NDVI, to explore the temporal changes between
   1982 and 2012; we used moderate resolution data, MODIS NDVI, to
   investigate the spatial variations of trends between 2001 and 2013. In
   addition, we examined the relationship between grassland change and
   climate change. The results revealed a significant upward trend in the
   annual mean NDVI of the LRR from 1982 to 2012, corroborating the
   observations of the local people. The increasing trend was more
   pronounced during the period of 1982-1999 than during the period of
   2000-2012. The seasonal NDVI also exhibited a significant upward trend
   in spring and summer from 1982 to 1999. From the higher resolution MODIS
   NDVI data analysis, during 2001-2013, the lower regression slope values
   were mainly distributed in the river valley (the area of lower
   elevation), whereas the higher values pixels were located in the
   northern LRR (the area of higher elevation). In addition, the annual
   NDVI correlated significantly with temperature and precipitation during
   the study period. Temperature is a more significant factor influencing
   grassland change than precipitation in spring and autumn. However, the
   precipitation with the time lag effect is more significantly correlated
   with NDVI during the growing season (from May to October). The results
   of this project will help to monitor regional vegetation changes,
   understand the impact of climate change, and better manage the
   economically, environmentally and culturally significant grasslands of
   the LRR.}},

Abstract = {{Phyllotaxis, i.e., the arrangement of leaves around the stem and
   leaf-like organs inside flowers is regular in most vascular plants.
   Thus, developmental models usually explain regular phyllotactic patterns
   such as Fibonacci spirals and decussate/whorled patterns that obey
   Hofmeister's rule: primordia form as far away as possible from
   previously initiated primordia. However, flowering plants showing at
   first Fibonacci spirals or whorled phyllotaxes may switch to other
   patterns that lack an obvious order and thus may be called irregular or
   even chaotic. Vegetative shoot tips of various Australian wattles
   (Acacia spp., Leguminosae in eudicots) and flower buds of ylang-ylang
   (Cananga odorata) and other Annonaceae (basal angiosperms) provide
   examples of irregular patterning. This pictorial report provides food
   for thought for scientists interested in phyllotaxis patterns beyond the
   usual spiral and whorled patterns. Emphasis is given on irregular
   phyllotaxes that occur in wild-type plants, mainly correlated with
   geometrical parameters such as leaf and stamen primordia that are very
   small as compared to the size of their apical meristems. They call for
   additional explanatory models, combining auxin-driven development with
   geometrical constraints and biophysical processes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we tackle a fundamental and long-time challenge in urban
   geography, to uncover a functionally differentiated global city network.
   To this day, the empirical investigation of a global multifunctional
   city network remains a challenge given the scarcity of appropriate
   relational and multifunctional data sources. To overcome this research
   gap, we present an interdisciplinary network modelling approach that
   integrates methods from geographic information science with social
   network analysis, including automated semantic analyses.We apply our
   modelling framework to a globally available, user-generated database
   (ie, Wikipedia), still underutilized in urban geography and planning
   research. The proposed visual analytical investigation of the
   multifunctional world city network also includes a systematic evaluation
   to assess the robustness of the proposed approach, and the adequacy of
   crowd-sourced databases for scientific uses. By example, we discuss
   economical and political relations of a latent multifunctional global
   city network which we uncovered with our data-driven approach. Our
   results not only empirically replicate previously well-established world
   city network theory, but also generate new research questions about
   multiple functions of cities, as hypothesized in world city network
   research. Furthermore, we showcase the potential of coupling text-based
   user-generated data analysis with geovisual analytics for scientific
   investigations in urban studies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Acclimation to light is a driver of tropical forest dynamics
   and key to understanding the coexistence of dipterocarps, and how their
   demographic rates and traits trade-off.
   Aims: We examined light niche divergence in six dipterocarp species and
   hypothesised that seedlings can be functionally grouped, and allocate
   resources to either growth or storage in response to light changes.
   Methods: A pot experiment was performed to measure size-specific growth
   rate, wood density and total non-structural carbohydrate (NSC)
   concentrations of dipterocarp seedlings exposed to a simulated gap
   opening.
   Results: Light-demanding species responded to a gap opening with
   increased growth and decreased wood density, whereas shade-tolerant
   species showed a greater relative increase in NSC concentration. Iditol
   -an alditol - was identified, and Dryobalanops lanceolata responded to a
   gap opening with a significantly smaller increase in alditol
   concentration compared to other species.
   Conclusions: We group light-demanding and shade-tolerant species based
   on their acclimation to light and show that a generalist species is
   unique based on its response of NSC concentration to a gap opening. Our
   findings emphasise that the ecology of these species needs to be further
   studied in the context of their physiology to support their effective
   use in large-scale forest restoration efforts.}},

   inherently geographical. The use of spatial information, accounting for
   neighborhood relationship and spatial smoothness of geographical
   objects, made its proofs in countless occasions and, especially when
   considering very high resolution images, methods ignoring spatial
   context do not perform well. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
   dual-layer conditional random field model that enforces spatial
   smoothness and consistency between the pixel and region-based maps. We
   formulate these intuitions as a standard energy minimization problem,
   and we show that finding a joint solution over both output spaces leads
   to strong improvements in the numerical and visual senses.}},

Abstract = {{Loss management is efficiency management if we increase the output
   (product, outcome, yield, effect, value) in relation to an input (or
   reference set) of an action. The phrasing ``we have to efficiently
   produce the right things{''} shows that efficiency is a means rather
   than an end. This special issue clarifies conceptual issues and
   misconceptions around losses and efficiency for the case of phosphorus,
   a non-renewable (i.e., finite) and essential mineral that is
   indispensable for food and life. The contributions focus on phosphorus
   mining, phosphorus fertilizer use, and the recycling of phosphorus from
   sewage and iron production. The current state and trends of losses and
   efficiencies in mining are presented and discussed, including low net
   use efficiency and total use efficiency. Papers on agriculture discuss
   the antagonistic relationships between yield (i.e., efficacy) and
   efficiency in fertilisation and the necessity to aspire to a calibrated
   nutrient balance, which also includes organic soil phosphorus pools.
   Papers on recycling sewage reveal that phosphorus recycling from sewage
   and iron/steel production is not only technologically possible but also
   may become economically feasible. A key message is that phosphorus
   management is a complex issue that includes misconceptions, fallacies,
   trade-offs and dilemmas. To overcome and properly cope with them,
   sustainable phosphorus management has to start from a comprehensive
   system model that includes both the flows and the actors. Contributions
   to material flow analysis show how this can become possible and how we
   may move from myths to data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Proteins containing a placenta-specific 8 domain (PLAC8) function as
   major organ size regulators in Solanum lycopersicum and Zea may, and
   putative metal ion transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa
   and Brassica juncea. However, it is unknown how PLAC8 domain-containing
   proteins fulfill such diverse roles. Here, we found that plant cadmium
   resistance 1 (PCR1) influences both zinc (Zn) accumulation and grain
   weight in rice. OsPCR1 knockout and knockdown lines produced lighter
   grains than the wild type, while OsPCR1 overexpression lines produced
   heavier grains. Furthermore, the grains of OsPCR1 knockdown lines
   exhibited substantially higher Zn and lower cadmium (Cd) concentrations
   than the control, as did yeast heterologously expressing OsPCR1. Through
   sequence analysis, we showed that the amino acid sequence of
   japonica-type PCR1 was distinct from that of indica-type and wild rice
   accessions. This difference was correlated with distinct Zn-related
   phenotypes. Japonica-type PCR1 had a shorter N-terminus than did PCR1 in
   the other rice types, and yeast heterologously expressing japonica-type
   PCR1 was more sensitive to Zn than was yeast expressing indica-type
   PCR1. Furthermore, japonica-type grains accumulated less Zn than did
   indica-type grains. Our study suggests that rice PCR1 maintains metal
   ion homeostasis and grain weight and might have been selected for during
   domestication.
   Proteins containing a placenta-specific 8 (PLAC8) domain regulate cell
   growth and cancer cell development in animals, fruit weight (FW2.2) in
   tomato, and cell number (ZmCNRs) in maize, and as putative metal ion
   transporters (PCRs, plant cadmium resistance) in Arabidopsis, rice, and
   Indian mustard. However, it has not been demonstrated how PLAC8
   domain-containing proteins fulfill such diverse functions. Here, we
   report that rice PCR1 regulates both the Zn contents of grains and grain
   weight. OsPCR1 knockout and knockdown lines produced lighter grains,
   while OsPCR1 overexpression lines produced heavier grains than the wild
   type. Furthermore, the Zn and Cd contents were altered in grains of the
   transgenic rice lines as well as in yeast cells heterologously
   expressing OsPCR1. Through PCR1 sequence analysis using different rice
   accessions collected from many countries, we found that the PCR1s in
   Japonica and Indica rice exhibited distinct amino acid sequences, and
   this difference was associated with Zn resistance and accumulation
   Japonica PCR1 enhanced Zn hypersensitivity in yeast, and Japonica rice
   contained less Zn in their grains than did Indica rice. Our functional
   study and genetic analysis suggests that rice PCR1 maintains metal ion
   homeostasis and grain weight and might have evolved during
   domestication. We believe that this discovery will give great interest
   to the readership of Plant Cell and Environment, as it provides clues as
   to how PLAC8 domain-containing proteins fulfill diverse functions.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing biotic introductions, there is a great need for
   predictive tools to anticipate which new trophic interactions will
   develop and which will not. Phylogenetic constraint of interactions in
   both native and novel food webs can make some novel interactions
   predictable. However, many food webs are sparsely sampled, or may
   include inaccurate interactions. In such cases, it is unclear whether
   modeling methods are still useful to anticipate novel interactions. We
   ran bootstrap simulations of host-use models on a Lepidoptera-plant data
   set to remove native trophic records or add erroneous records in order
   to observe the effect of missing or erroneous data on the prediction of
   interactions with novel plants. We found that the model was robust to a
   large amount of missing interaction records, but lost predictive power
   with the addition of relatively few erroneous interaction records. The

Abstract = {{Simultaneous hermaphroditism is predicted to be unstable at high mating
   rates given an associated increase in sperm competition. The existence
   of reciprocal egg trading, which requires both hermaphroditism and high
   mating rates to evolve, is consequently hard to explain. We show using
   mathematical models that the presence of a trading economy creates an
   additional fitness benefit to egg production, which selects for traders
   to bias their sex allocation toward the female function. This
   female-biased sex allocation prevents pure females from invading a
   trading population, thereby allowing simultaneous hermaphroditism to
   persist stably at much higher levels of sperm competition than would
   otherwise be expected. More generally, our model highlights that
   simultaneous hermaphroditism can persist stably when mating
   opportunities are abundant, as long as sperm competition remains low. It
   also predicts that reciprocity will select for heavier investment in the
   traded resource.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of retrieving soil moisture under
   crops using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. First, we simulated the
   time series of L-band SAR signals over agricultural fields using a
   discrete radiative transfer model (RTM). Full growth cycles of winter
   wheat, maize, and sugar beet fields sampled during the AgriSAR2006
   (Agricultural bio/geophysical retrievals from frequent repeat pass SAR
   and optical imaging) field campaign were considered. A generally good
   correspondence between the simulated crop backscattering coefficients
   and those measured by the airborne L-band E-SAR (Experimental-SAR)
   system was observed with an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of
   2.32 dB. The highest RMSE of 3.63 dB was obtained by the RTM simulations
   of HV polarized signals in the wheat field, whereas the smallest RMSE of
   1.63 dB is achieved in RTM simulations of HV backscattering coefficients
   in the field of sugar beet. All discrepancies were critically discussed
   and interpreted. Then, soil moisture was estimated using a nonlinear
   inversion technique, support vector regression (nu-SVR). The model was
   trained with the backscatter model simulations obtained by the RTM. For
   all fields considered, the RMSE of the predicted soil moisture was
   smaller than 5.5\% Vol. and the corresponding correlation coefficient
   (r) was equal to or higher than 0.71.}},

Abstract = {{Alnus x spaethii is a hybrid alder with the parent species A. japonica
   and A. subcordata. It is known for both its tolerance for urban climate
   conditions and enhanced air pollution concentrations and hence often
   figures on recommended tree guidance lists in towns. At the MeteoSwiss
   pollen station of Buchs (Switzerland), unusual early peaks of alder
   pollen already in December or January have been observed in the last 8
   years. These peaks occurred several days to weeks earlier than at any
   other Swiss pollen station. As pollen source, an alley of Alnus x
   spaethii trees, planted in 1995-2000, 800 m south of the pollen trap
   could be identified. Phenological observations during this period in
   Buchs confirmed these pollen observations and showed that the trees were
   fully flowering on December 30, 2009, December 28, 2010 and 2011 and
   December 24, 2012. Due to the presence of Alnus x spaethii a very early,
   longer and more intense alder pollen season was observed in Buchs. As
   recently shown, these alder pollen can be also of clinical relevance.
   Thus, newly introduced plant species seem to be able to become a
   relevant allergen within a short time.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the interaction between larvae of two anuran amphibian
   species (Rana temporaria and Bufo bufo) to test models of two-species
   competition. The study had a response surface experimental design with
   four replicates, each consisting of 24 density combinations. Larval
   performance-and, by assumption, change in population size-was defined by
   a linear combination of survival, growth, and development. We fit six
   competition models from the literature and discovered that density
   dependence was strongly non-linear, with the highest support for the
   Hassel-Comins model. Rana temporaria was competitively superior to B.
   bufo; the impacts of both species on growth and development were about
   five-to tenfold greater than those on survival. Isocline analysis
   predicted a stable configuration, which agrees with the observation that
   these two species are syntopic in nature. The results of this study
   confirm competition theory by identifying a model structure that agrees
   with data and making predictions that are broadly supportive of the

Title = {{Reconstruction of environmental changes during the late glacial and
   Holocene reflected in a soil-sedimentary sequence from the lower Selenga
   River valley, Lake Baikal region, Siberia, assessed by lipid molecular
   proxies}},
Journal = {{QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{Sediments of Lake Baikal and smaller lakes in its surroundings have been
   frequently used to trace paleoenvironmental changes. However, these
   sediments integrate environmental proxies over large areas and the
   processes leading to alteration of terrestrial signals are not fully
   understood. More specific information can be derived from terrestrial
   archives such as alternating soil-sediment sequences. Near the village
   of Burdukovo, southeast of Lake Baikal, such sequences are accessible
   along the similar to 5 m high right terrace of the Selenga River.
   However, terrestrial archives can be associated with degradation of
   organic matter. Therefore, lipid molecular proxies were applied in the
   current study to trace environmental and vegetation shifts as well as
   incorporation and degradation of organic matter. Alkane and fatty acid
   molecular proxies as part of the lipid fraction are well known for their
   diagnostic character to trace sources of organic matter and its
   degradation. Several parameters including the carbon preference indices
   of alkanes and fatty acids indicated a well preservation of the organic
   matter in the investigated sequence. Furthermore, the organic matter in
   the C horizons of the terrestrial upper part of the sediments was most
   likely overprinted by rooting of the plants growing on respective
   overlaying soils as reflected by the average chain length of fatty acids
   and alkanes and the relative composition of long-chain n-alkanes
   (C25-33). The 3.5 m thick sequence enabled tracing of vegetation shifts.
   The alkane composition argued for changes in the grass dominated
   vegetation cover within the different phases of the Holocene until
   today, whereas a birch and willow dominated deciduous forest vegetation
   as traced in other archives of the larger Baikal area could not be
   determined in the Burdukovo sequence by lipid molecular proxies. The
   scatter in the alkane and fatty acid composition revealed only minor
   vegetation shifts throughout the Holocene. Nevertheless, some changes in
   the lipid composition indicated a change in the plant community. As
   coniferous trees have often similar alkane patterns to grass vegetation,
   it cannot be excluded that conifers also contributed to a certain degree
   to the molecular record in the Burdukovo sequence. The general decrease
   in the carbon preference index of alkanes since approximately 4 ka BP
   until recent times further argues for an increasing admixture of
   coniferous lipids to the record. Lipid molecular proxies of sediment
   that formed 2.8-2.6 ka BP revealed the incorporation of deciduous
   tree-derived organic matter most likely originating from birch that grew
   elsewhere in the catchment of the Selenga River. The proxies enabled an
   assessment of site-specific vegetation shifts and degradation of organic
   matter in the soil-sediment sequence of the Burdukovo area, and thus
   provide more specific information related to a certain area than
   lacustrine sediments integrating over larger catchments. (C) 2015

Title = {{Folkbotanical classification: morphological, ecological and utilitarian
   characterization of plants in the Napf region, Switzerland}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Discussions surrounding ethnobiological classification have
   been broad and diverse. One of the recurring questions is whether
   classification is mainly based on the ``inherent structure of biological
   reality{''} or on cultural, especially utilitarian needs. So far,
   studies about ethnobotanical classification have mainly been done in
   indigenous societies. Comparable data from industrialized countries are
   scarce. In this paper, folkbotanical classification data from the Napf
   region in central Switzerland is analysed and cross-culturally compared.
   Methods: Structured and semi-structured interviews were conducted with
   60 adults and children chosen by random sampling. Descriptive
   statistics, t-tests and cultural domain analysis were used to analyze
   the data.
   Results: Close to 500 folk taxa have been documented during field work.
   As life-form taxa appeared tree, bush, grass, herb, flower, and
   mushroom. Intermediate taxa mentioned regularly were sub-categories of
   the life form tree and bush, i. e. conifer, deciduous tree, fruit tree,
   stone fruits, pomaceous fruits, and berry bush. The rank of the folk
   generic was by far the largest with 316 taxa (85.4\% monotypical). The
   specific rank contained 145 taxa, the varietal 14 taxa. The 475 generic,
   specific and varietal folk taxa could be assigned to 298 wild growing
   plant species, which make up 28.13\% of the local flora, and to 213
   cultivated plant species, subspecies and cultivars.
   Morphology, mainly life-form, fruits, leaves, and flowers, was the most
   important criterion for classifying plants. Other important criteria
   were their use (mainly edibility) and habitat (mainly meadow, forest and
   garden). The three criteria emerged spontaneously out of open
   questioning.
   Conclusion: The classification system of the Napf region is comparable
   to classification systems of indigenous societies, both in its shallow
   hierarchical structure and in the amount of recognized taxa.
   The classification of plants was mainly guided by morphology, habitat
   and use. The three aspects seem to be mutually linked for certain plant
   groups, which results in always the same groups, independent from the
   different sorting criteria. Sensory perception allows for a broader
   explanation of the known coincidence of morphology and use groups.}},

Abstract = {{Recent empirical studies have shown that genetic factors can influence
   the invasion success of alien species. Like species diversity, higher
   genetic diversity can increase plant performance or invasion success via
   selection effects or complementarity effects. The latter have also been
   referred to as nonadditive effects because in this case individual
   genotypes show a different performance in mixtures than in monocultures.
   Based on a manipulation experiment in the field, a recent study found
   that such non-additive effects of genotype mixing become stronger over
   time in an invasive plant, probably due to higher resource uptake or
   facilitation between genotypes. Other researchers criticized this
   interpretation because in their view complementarity or non-additive
   effects should lead to transgressive over-performance which could not
   occur based on selection effects alone, where simply differences of
   performance between genotypes would enhance the invasion ability of
   multiple-genotype patches. In a commentary paper we applied Monte Carlo
   permutation and Loreau and Hector's additive partitioning to two
   datasets and found that although transgressive over-performance cannot
   occur due to only selection effects and thus is the most stringent test
   for the existence of complementarity effects, complementarity effects
   also commonly occur without transgressive over-performance.}},

Abstract = {{Tapirs are the only group among the perissodactyls for which no recent
   description of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) exists. Historical
   depictions of the GIT of tapirs suggest a similarity to the GIT of
   equids, but do not resolve the question whether the isthmus at the
   caeco-colical junction, and at the transition from the proximal colon to
   the colon transversum-both evident in horses-occur in tapirs as well.
   Here, we describe the macroscopic anatomy of the GIT of a captive, adult
   lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris). While similar to equids in terms of
   the overall design and, in particular, the two mentioned isthmuses, the
   proximal colon of the tapir appeared less pronounced than in other
   perissodactyls, resulting in a GIT in which the caecum appeared as the
   most voluminous fermentation chamber. This finding is supported by the
   particular location of the ileo-caecal junction, which does not visibly
   separate the caecum from the colon, or the caecum head from the caecum
   body, but enters the caecum body in its upper third.}},

Abstract = {{Palynostratigraphy across the Permian-Triassic of the Salt Range and
   Surghar Range area remains poorly known because of the predominance of
   unsuitable facies and preservation (Nammal, Chhidru, Chitta-Landu and
   Narmia). Dolomite and limestone in the basal Mianwali Formation
   prevented the establishment of a palynostratigraphic scheme for the
   basal Early Triassic (Hermann et al. 2012). Based on the study of a new
   Permian-Triassic section in the Amb valley where siltstone layers are
   intercalated in the basal Mianwali Formation (Kathwai Member), we
   describe a new record of palynological assemblages from the uppermost
   Permian Chhidru Formation and the lowermost part of the Early Triassic
   Mianwali Formation. The latest Permian Chhidru 2 sporomorph association
   occurs in the uppermost part of the Chhidru Formation, the so-called
   `white sandstone unit'. It is marked by the dominance of bisaccate
   pollen grains (mainly Protohaploxypinus spp.) and cavate trilete spores
   (mainly Kraeuselisporites spp.). Here, the previously described
   lowermost Triassic palynozone PTr 1 is subdivided into two subzones. PTr
   1a assemblages are described from the Griesbachian Kathwai Member. They
   are characterized by continued high bisaccate pollen grain abundances
   and the presence of the lycopod genera Lundbladispora spp. and
   Densoisporites spp. In these assemblages, typical `Permian taxa' and
   typical `Triassic taxa' are mixed. The composition of the middle
   Dienerian PTr 1b assemblages corresponds to the previously described PTr
   1 assemblage from Nammal and Chitta-Landu. Lundbladispora spp. and
   Densoisporites spp. account for ca. 80\% of the total assemblage in PTr
   1b. Although the Griesbachian assemblages record a decrease in
   diversity, the middle Dienerian assemblages represent the poorest
   assemblages of the studied Permian-Triassic interval. Reduviasporonites
   occurs only sporadically throughout the Amb succession.}},

Title = {{Deriving movement properties and the effect of the environment from the
   Brownian bridge movement model in monkeys and birds}},
Journal = {{MOVEMENT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) provides a
   biologically sound approximation of the movement path of an animal based
   on discrete location data, and is a powerful method to quantify
   utilization distributions. Computing the utilization distribution based
   on the BBMM while calculating movement parameters directly from the
   location data, may result in inconsistent and misleading results. We
   show how the BBMM can be extended to also calculate derived movement
   parameters. Furthermore we demonstrate how to integrate environmental
   context into a BBMM-based analysis.
   Results: We develop a computational framework to analyze animal movement
   based on the BBMM. In particular, we demonstrate how a derived movement
   parameter (relative speed) and its spatial distribution can be
   calculated in the BBMM. We show how to integrate our framework with the
   conceptual framework of the movement ecology paradigm in two related but
   acutely different ways, focusing on the influence that the environment
   has on animal movement. First, we demonstrate an a posteriori approach,
   in which the spatial distribution of average relative movement speed as
   obtained from a ``contextually naive{''} model is related to the local
   vegetation structure within the monthly ranging area of a group of wild
   vervet monkeys. Without a model like the BBMM it would not be possible
   to estimate such a spatial distribution of a parameter in a sound way.
   Second, we introduce an a priori approach in which atmospheric
   information is used to calculate a crucial parameter of the BBMM to
   investigate flight properties of migrating bee-eaters. This analysis
   shows significant differences in the characteristics of flight modes,
   which would have not been detected without using the BBMM.
   Conclusions: Our algorithm is the first of its kind to allow BBMM-based
   computation of movement parameters beyond the utilization distribution,
   and we present two case studies that demonstrate two fundamentally
   different ways in which our algorithm can be applied to estimate the
   spatial distribution of average relative movement speed, while
   interpreting it in a biologically meaningful manner, across a wide range
   of environmental scenarios and ecological contexts. Therefore movement
   parameters derived from the BBMM can provide a powerful method for
   movement ecology research.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we report results from a qualitative user experiment
   (n=107) designed to contribute to understanding the impact of various
   levels of complexity (mainly based on levels of detail, i.e., LoD) in 3D
   city models, specifically on the participants' orientation and cognitive
   (mental) maps. The experiment consisted of a number of tasks motivated
   by spatial cognition theory where participants (among other things) were
   given orientation tasks, and in one case also produced sketches of a
   path they `travelled' in a virtual environment. The experiments were
   conducted in groups, where individuals provided responses on an answer
   sheet. The preliminary results based on descriptive statistics and
   qualitative sketch analyses suggest that very little information (i.e.,
   a low LoD model of a smaller area) might have a negative impact on the
   accuracy of cognitive maps constructed based on a virtual experience.
   Building an accurate cognitive map is an inherently desired effect of
   the visualizations in planning tasks, thus the findings are important
   for understanding how to develop better-suited 3D visualizations such as
   3D city models. In this study, we specifically discuss the suitability
   of different levels of visual complexity for development planning (urban
   planning), one of the domains where 3D city models are most relevant.}},

Abstract = {{In nest-building species predation of nest contents is a main cause of
   reproductive failure and parents have to trade off reproductive
   investment against antipredatory behaviours. While this trade-off is
   modified by lifespan (short-lived species prioritize current
   reproduction; long-lived species prioritize future reproduction), it may
   vary within a breeding season, but this idea has only been tested in
   short-lived species. Yet, life history theory does not make any
   prediction how long-lived species should trade off current against
   future reproductive investment within a season. Here, we investigated
   this trade-off through predator-exposure experiments in a long-lived
   bird species, the brown thornbill. We exposed breeding pairs that had no
   prior within-season reproductive success to the models of a nest
   predator and a predator of adults during their first or second breeding
   attempt. Overall, parents reduced their feeding rate in the presence of
   a predator, but parents feeding second broods were more risk sensitive
   and almost ceased feeding when exposed to both types of predators.
   However, during second breeding attempts, parents had larger clutches
   and a higher feeding rate in the absence of predators than during first
   breeding attempts and approached both types of predators closer when
   mobbing. Our results suggest that the trade-off between reproductive
   investment and risk-taking can change in a long-lived species within a
   breeding season depending on both prior nest predation and renesting
   opportunities. These patterns correspond to those in short-lived
   species, raising the question of whether a within-season shift in
   reproductive investment trade-offs is independent of lifespan.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral image classification has long been dominated by convex
   models, which provide accurate decision functions exploiting all the
   features in the input space. However, the need for high geometrical
   details, which are often satisfied by using spatial filters, and the
   need for compact models (i.e. relying on models issued form reduced
   input spaces) has pushed research to study alternatives such as sparsity
   inducing regularization, which promotes models using only a subset of
   the input features. Although successful in reducing the number of active
   inputs, these models can be biased and sometimes offer sparsity at the
   cost of reduced accuracy. In this paper, we study the possibility of
   using non-convex regularization, which limits the bias induced by the
   regularization. We present and compare four regularizers, and then apply
   them to hyperspectral classification with different cost functions.}},

Abstract = {{Compensatory health beliefs (CHBs) are beliefs that an unhealthy
   behavior can be compensated with a healthy behavior. In line with the
   CHBs model, the aim of this study was twofold. First, the study
   investigated the relationship between autonomous motivation and CHBs
   that physical inactivity can be compensated by taking the stairs instead
   of the elevator. Second, the study focused on the associations between
   CHBs and readiness to use the stairs more often and stair and elevator
   use. Thus, a cross-sectional online questionnaire was designed that was
   filled out by 135 participants. Path analysis showed that individuals
   with stronger autonomous motivation to use the stairs strongly agreed
   that sedentary behavior could be compensated by taking the stairs
   instead of the elevator. Moreover, CHBs were positively related to
   readiness to change behavior, but not to self-reported stair and
   elevator use. Even though future research is necessary to replicate
   these findings, autonomous motivation seems to have a positive impact on
   CHBs which, in turn, might boost an intended behavior change. Thus,
   promoting possible compensation of physical inactivity might foster the
   readiness to change the unhealthy behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Certified emission reductions (CERs) from Clean Development Mechanism
   (CDM) projects have traditionally served as an indirect link between cap
   and trade systems around the world. However, since 2010, import
   restrictions have increased. Reasons for import limitations include the
   supplementarity principle, genuine concerns about the environmental
   integrity of CERs and social benefits of CDM projects, pressure from
   domestic emissions mitigation industries, concerns about competition in
   the industries in which reductions take place, as well as the attempt to
   pressure advanced developing countries to accept national emissions
   commitments under a future international climate policy regime. It is
   shown that import limitations lead to a decrease in CER prices and a
   race to generate CERs as quickly as possible. Such effects are visible
   in the CDM market after the EU announced its import limitations. The
   exclusion of CERs from specific project types will distort the CDM
   supply curve and increase the CER price unless the marginal abatement
   costs of the excluded project type are above the CER world market price.
   Similarly, exclusion of CERs from specific host countries will increase
   the price. Substantial differences are found in CER access to national
   carbon markets around the world.Policy relevanceCDM regulators could try
   to improve access of CERs to cap and trade schemes through improvements
   to additionality testing, standardizing baseline and monitoring
   methodologies and stakeholder consultation. However, regulators should
   be aware that standardization is no panacea, and controversies may
   resurface if standardized additionality determination (e.g. through
   benchmarks or positive lists) are applied for a certain period and found
   to be problematic. However, domestic policy concerns such as an
   unwillingness to send money abroad to buy credits, an inability to
   control market prices, and competitiveness impacts cannot be resolved by
   CDM reforms. If, despite such reforms of the CDM, blatant protectionism
   continues, a challenge before the World Trade Organisation (WTO) could
   be launched to stop discrimination of service exports from specific
   countries.}},

Title = {{Impact of changing flood regime on a lakeshore plant community:
   Long-term observations and individual-based simulation}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{273}},
Pages = {{151-164}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Disturbance events shape plant communities depending on the disturbance
   regime as well as on the properties of the species constituting the
   community. We studied a lakeshore community at Lake Constance, a
   pre-alpine lake in Central Europe, where disturbance by flooding has a
   strong impact as the water level is almost not regulated by man. The
   lakeshore habitats are shaped by annual summer flooding during the
   vegetation period of plants, with seasonal course and magnitude of
   water-level fluctuations varying considerably between years. By a
   combination of field work and modelling we examined (1) whether flooding
   tolerance and interactions between individuals can explain zonation and
   species coexistence at lakeshore, (2) how strongly invasive species are
   affecting habitat specific species, and (3) whether changing flooding
   regimes due to potential climate changes will affect species
   composition.
   The study was based on a long-term monitoring record (23 years;
   1988-2005) of presence/absence of six species along two transects in a
   species-poor community at Lake Constance and on detailed records of
   annual flooding. We succeeded in parameterizing a spatially explicit
   individual-based life-cycle model of community dynamics on a
   pattern-oriented basis. This gave results on species demography,
   dispersal, and interactions. The parameterized model could be verified
   along additional data recorded in 2011.
   The results of model parameterization showed that the habitat
   specialists (characteristic species for the studied lakeshore community)
   will be able to coexist with stable zonation over the coming decades,
   mainly due to a contrast between flood tolerance and strength of
   competitive interactions forming a variant of the
   competition-colonization trade-off model of coexistence. As a
   consequence, long-term shortening of the average flooding period, as
   predicted for the future, should negatively affect flood-tolerant but
   weakly competing habitat specialists. Here, an avoiding strategy, a
   shift of flood-tolerant plant species to lower parts of the lakeshore
   beyond transect boundary and hence beyond present model range, is to be
   expected.
   The modelling results revealed that two native but invasive species will
   have an increasing impact on the community, and they are predicted to
   endanger habitat specialists on a long run. This was verified already by
   the re-examination in 2011. Following the parameter values, invasive
   species threatening the lakeshore community are both flood-tolerant and
   competitive. Their expected importance for the fate of the community
   even exceeds that of possible changes in flood duration.
   The study demonstrates that an individual-based model can be developed
   on the basis of nonstationary, temporally and spatially changing local
   abundance data. Such a model goes beyond conventional matrix modelling
   by the inclusion of nonlinear features as a consequence of individual
   interactions, and such features turn out to be decisive factor for
   dealing with species coexistence and displacement in a plant community.

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Ruta oreojasme is an endangered species endemic to
   Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain), where it occurs in small
   populations with disjunct distribution. Nothing is known about the
   genetic structure of these populations.
   Methods and Results: Using a microsatellite-enriched library method, 10
   microsatellite markers have been developed from R. oreojasme, all of
   which showed polymorphism. The transferability of the 10 markers was
   tested in two other Canarian endemic species, R. microcarpa and R.
   pinnata, as well as in the widespread species R. montana.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the value of these newly developed
   microsatellite markers to investigate the genetic structure in R.
   oreojasme and show their potential applicability for population genetic
   studies in other Ruta species.}},

   regarding their science-related information behavior and whether such
   segments are comparable or vary between two countries with similar
   information environments. Based on two surveys in Switzerland and
   Germany, we identify national audience segments that differ in their
   science-related information repertoires, and analyze their
   sociodemographic characteristics and science-related attitudes. In both
   countries, we find very comparable information user segments ranging
   from those who inform themselves frequently about science ({''}Active
   Seekers{''}/{''}Science Consumers{''}) to those who hardly get in
   contact with any information about science and research

Abstract = {{Grasses are essential plants for ecosystem functioning. Quantifying the
   selective pressures that act on natural variation in grass species is
   therefore essential regarding biodiversity maintenance. In this study,
   we investigate the selection pressures that act on two distinct
   populations of the grass model Brachypodium distachyon without prior
   knowledge about the traits under selection. We took advantage of
   whole-genome sequencing data produced for 44 natural accessions of
   B.distachyon and used complementary genome-wide selection scans (GWSS)
   methods to detect genomic regions under balancing and positive
   selection. We show that selection is shaping genetic diversity at
   multiple temporal and spatial scales in this species, and affects
   different genomic regions across the two populations. Gene ontology
   annotation of candidate genes reveals that pathogens may constitute
   important factors of positive and balancing selection in B.distachyon.
   We eventually cross-validated our results with quantitative trait locus
   data available for leaf-rust resistance in this species and demonstrate
   that, when paired with classical trait mapping, GWSS can help
   pinpointing candidate genes for further molecular validation. Thanks to
   a near base-perfect reference genome and the large collection of freely
   available natural accessions collected across its natural range,
   B.distachyon appears as a prime system for studies in ecology,
   population genomics and evolutionary biology.
   Significance Statement We used genome-wide scans of selection in the
   grass Brachypodiumdistachyon and show that biotic stress constitutes a
   major constraint in this system.}},

Abstract = {{Physical forces are involved in the regulation of plant development and
   morphogenesis by translating mechanical stress into the modification of
   physiological processes, which, in turn, can affect cellular growth.
   Pollen tubes respond rapidly to external stimuli and provide an ideal
   system to study the effect of mechanical cues at the single-cell level.
   Here, pollen tubes were exposed to mechanical stress while monitoring
   the reconfiguration of their growth and recording the generated forces
   in real-time.
   We combined a lab-on-a-chip device with a microelectromechanical systems
   (MEMS)-based capacitive force sensor to mimic and quantify the forces
   that are involved in pollen tube navigation upon confronting mechanical
   obstacles. Several stages of obstacle avoidance were identified,
   including force perception, growth adjustment and penetration.
   We have experimentally determined the perceptive force threshold, which
   is the force threshold at which the pollen tube reacts to an obstacle,
   for Lilium longiflorum and Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, the method
   we developed provides a way to calculate turgor pressure based on force
   and optical data.
   Pollen tubes sense physical barriers and actively adjust their growth
   behavior to overcome them. Furthermore, our system offers an ideal
   platform to investigate intracellular activity during force perception
   and growth adaption in tip growing cells.}},

Abstract = {{Arsenic (As) is a poisonous element that causes severe skin lesions and
   cancer in humans. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a major dietary source of As
   in humans who consume this cereal as a staple food. We hypothesized that
   increasing As vacuolar sequestration would inhibit its translocation
   into the grain and reduce the amount of As entering the food chain. We
   developed transgenic rice plants expressing two different vacuolar As
   sequestration genes, ScYCF1 and OsABCC1, under the control of the RCc3
   promoter in the root cortical and internode phloem cells, along with a
   bacterial gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase driven by the maize UBI
   promoter. The transgenic rice plants exhibited reduced root-to-shoot and
   internode-to-grain As translocation, resulting in a 70\% reduction in As
   accumulation in the brown rice without jeopardizing agronomic traits.
   This technology could be used to reduce As intake, particularly in
   populations of South East Asia suffering from As toxicity and thereby
   improve human health.}},

Abstract = {{Support for macroecological rules in insects is mixed, with potential
   confounding interrelations between patterns rarely studied. We here
   investigate global patterns in body and wing size, sexual size
   dimorphism and range size in common fruit flies (Diptera: Drosophilidae)
   and explore potential interrelations and the predictive power of
   Allen's, Bergmann's, Rensch's and Rapoport's rules. We found that thorax
   length (r(2)=0.05) and wing size (r(2)=0.09) increased with latitude,
   supporting Bergmann's rule. Contrary to patterns often found in
   endothermic vertebrates, relative wing size increased towards the poles
   (r(2)=0.12), a pattern against Allen's rule, which we attribute to
   selection for increased flight capacity in the cold. Sexual size
   dimorphism decreased with size, evincing Rensch's rule across the family
   (r(2)=0.14). Yet, this pattern was largely driven by the virilis-repleta
   radiation. Finally, range size did not correlate with latitude, although
   a positive relationship was present in a subset of the species
   investigated, providing no convincing evidence for Rapoport's rule. We
   further found little support for confounding interrelations between body
   size, wing loading and range size in this taxon. Nevertheless, we
   demonstrate that studying several traits simultaneously at minimum
   permits better interpretation in case of multiple, potentially
   conflicting trends or hypotheses concerning the macroecology of insects.}},

Abstract = {{Plants sense light and temperature changes to regulate flowering time.
   Here, we show that expression of the Arabidopsis florigen gene,
   FLOWERING LOCUS T (Fr, peaks in the morning during spring, a different
   pattern than we observe in the laboratory. Providing our laboratory
   growth conditions with a red/far-red light ratio similar to open-field
   conditions and daily temperature oscillation is sufficient to mimic the
   FT expression and flowering time in natural long days. Under the
   adjusted growth conditions, key light signalling components, such as
   phytochrome A and EARLY FLOWERING 3, play important roles in morning FT
   expression. These conditions stabilize CONSTANS protein, a major FT
   activator, in the morning, which is probably a critical mechanism for
   photoperiodic flowering in nature. Refining the parameters of our
   standard growth conditions to more precisely mimic plant responses in
   nature can provide a powerful method for improving our understanding of
   seasonal response.}},

Abstract = {{Language is inherently combinatorial, and parallels of this
   combinatorial capacity are found in nonhuman systems, with animals
   combining sounds and calls into larger meaningful structures. However,
   further analogue examples are central in unveiling the diversity,
   distribution, and evolutionary drivers of combinatoriality. Here, we
   provide evidence for internal ``meaning-refining{''} acoustic variation
   within a larger stereotyped signal in pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor).
   Using acoustic analyses, we demonstrate that males produce 2 long,
   raucous, ``cry-like{''} structures, both starting with a wind-up segment
   grading into repetitions of A/single-note or AB/double-note motifs.
   Behavioral observations indicated that, consistent with similarities in
   their larger stereotyped structure, both variants function overall in
   recruiting group members during locomotion, but the internal A or AB
   substructure specifies the ``precise{''} form of recruitment, from
   approaching the caller's announced location to following it over longer
   distances. Playing back cries from a stationary loudspeaker further
   supported that the 2 variants elicit different responses, with more
   individuals approaching the loudspeaker in response to single-note
   compared with double-note cries. Additionally, despite similarities in
   overall distance travelled, group movement was only directional for
   single-note, but undefined for double-note cries. We suggest that the
   overall structure of the 2 cry variants conveys the same general
   meaning, with embedded variation refining this meaning. These results
   further illustrate the variability of generative mechanisms outside of
   human language and lend support to the hypothesis that combinatorial
   structuring may have emerged in species with limited or fixed vocal
   repertoires in order to enhance communicative output.}},

Abstract = {{Local adaptation to rare habitats is difficult due to gene flow, but can
   occur if the habitat has higher productivity. Differences in offspring
   phenotypes have attracted little attention in this context. We model a
   scenario where the rarer habitat improves offspring's later competitive
   ability - a carryover effect that operates on top of local adaptation to
   one or the other habitat type. Assuming localised dispersal, so the
   offspring tend to settle in similar habitat to the natal type, the
   superior competitive ability of offspring remaining in the rarer habitat
   hampers immigration from the majority habitat. This initiates a positive
   feedback between local adaptation and trait divergence, which can
   thereafter be reinforced by coevolution with dispersal traits that match
   ecotype to habitat type. Rarity strengthens selection on dispersal
   traits and promotes linkage disequilibrium between locally adapted
   traits and ecotype-habitat matching dispersal. We propose that carryover
   effects may initiate isolation by ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal is a key ecological process that influences the dynamics of
   spatially and socially structured populations and consists of three
   stages emigration, transience, and settlement and each stage is
   influenced by different social, individual, and environmental factors.
   Despite our appreciation of the complexity of the process, we lack a
   firm empirical understanding of the mechanisms underlying the different
   stages. Here, using data from 65 GPS-collared dispersing female
   coalitions of the cooperatively breeding meerkat (S'uricata suricatta),
   we present a comprehensive analysis of the effects of population
   density, mate availability, dispersing coalition size, and individual
   factors on each of the three stages of dispersal in a wild population.
   We expected a positive effect of density on dispersal due to increased
   kin competition at high densities. We further anticipated positive
   effects of mate availability, coalition size, and body condition on
   dispersal success. We observed increasing daily emigration and
   settlement probabilities at high population densities. In addition, we
   found that emigration and settlement probabilities also increased at low
   densities and were lowest at medium densities. Daily emigration and
   settlement probabilities increased with increasing female coalition size
   and in the presence of unrelated males. Furthermore, the time
   individuals spent in the transient stage increased with population
   density, whereas coalition size and presence of unrelated males
   decreased dispersal distance. The observed nonlinear relationship
   between dispersal and population density is likely due to limited
   benefits of cooperation at low population densities and increased kin
   competition at high densities. Our study provides empirical validation
   for the theoretical predictions that population density is an important
   factor driving the evolution of delayed dispersal and philopatry in
   cooperative breeders.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, the view of circadian oscillators has expanded from
   transcriptional feedback to incorporate post-transcriptional,
   post-translational, metabolic processes and ionic signalling. In plants
   and animals, there are circadian oscillations in the concentration of
   cytosolic free Ca2+ ({[}Ca2+](cyt)), though their purpose has not been
   fully characterized. We investigated whether circadian oscillations of
   {[}Ca2+](cyt) regulate the circadian oscillator of Arabidopsis thaliana.
   We report that in Arabidopsis, {[}Ca2+](cyt) circadian oscillations can
   regulate circadian clock function through the Ca2+-dependent action of
   CALMODULIN-LIKE24 (CML24). Genetic analyses demonstrate a linkage
   between CML24 and the circadian oscillator, through pathways involving
   the circadian oscillator gene TIMING OF CAB2 EXPRESSION1 (TOC1).}},

Abstract = {{Forest ecosystems are an integral component of the global carbon cycle
   as they take up and release large amounts of C over short time periods
   (C flux) or accumulate it over longer time periods (C stock). However,
   there remains uncertainty about whether and in which direction C fluxes
   and in particular C stocks may differ between forests of high versus low
   species richness. Based on a comprehensive dataset derived from
   field-based measurements, we tested the effect of species richness (3-20
   tree species) and stand age (22-116 years) on six compartments of
   above-and below-ground C stocks and four components of C fluxes in
   subtropical forests in southeast China. Across forest stands, total C
   stock was 149 +/- 12 Mg ha(-1) with richness explaining 28.5\% and age
   explaining 29.4\% of variation in this measure. Species-rich stands had
   higher C stocks and fluxes than stands with low richness; and, in
   addition, old stands had higher C stocks than young ones. Overall, for
   each additional tree species, the total C stock increased by 6.4\%. Our
   results provide comprehensive evidence for diversity-mediated above-and
   below-ground C sequestration in species-rich subtropical forests in
   southeast China. Therefore, afforestation policies in this region and
   elsewhere should consider a change from the current focus on
   monocultures to multi-species plantations to increase C fixation and
   thus slow increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global warming.}},

Abstract = {{The study of the Leventina valley site of Airolo-Madrano ``In Grop{''}
   (Ticino, Switzerland; altitude 1156 m asl), inhabited during the Bronze
   and Iron Ages, is important in the current debate about mountain
   societies and economies in pre- and protohistoric times. The compilation
   of botanical data (seeds, pollen, charcoal) gathered during the
   excavations helps to define the type of occupation, the subsistence and
   the human impact on the upper Leventina valley between c. 1650 and 200
   cal. BCE. Subsistence and husbandry activities, including cultivation,
   gathering, collecting of bedding and forage, even grazing in the
   forests, seems to have evolved in the local landscape. Under growing
   anthropogenic or environmental pressure from the Late/Final Bronze Age
   onwards, the opening of the landscape was not associated with expanding
   settlements, but more probably with a shift in forest subsistence
   economy activities. Like at other mid-altitude mountain sites in
   Switzerland and in bordering countries (Austria, Italy), barley (Hordum
   vulgare) was the most common crop, followed by other cereals (Triticum
   dicoccon, Tr. spelta, cf. Tr. aestivum/turgidum, cf. Panicum miliaceum),
   pulses (Pisum sativum, cf. Vicia faba beginning in the Iron Age) and
   oil-producing plants (Linum usitatissimum). Clear indicators of contact
   with the subalpine range that dominates the region of Madrano have not
   been found. However, the results of landscape surveys in that area show
   a human presence earlier, contemporary and later than that of the
   mountain dwelling in the valley, and moreover suggest that the tree line
   was at an elevation of more than 2000 m asl in the Bronze Age. The
   presence of pollen and cereal fruit in the Late Bronze Age (Hordeum
   vulgare) and post-Medieval periods (remains of threshing of Triticum cf.
   dicoccon/monococcum) might imply cultivation in high altitudes, the
   upper elevation of which remains undetermined, in spite of the
   coincidence between palaeoclimatical proxies and ethnographic data. (C)

Abstract = {{At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Rhine glacier in the Swiss Alps
   covered an area of about 16 000 km(2). As part of an integrative study
   about the safety of repositories for radioactive waste under ice age
   conditions in Switzerland, we modeled the Rhine glacier using a
   thermodynamically coupled three-dimensional, transient Stokes flow and
   heat transport model down to a horizontal resolution of about 500 m. The
   accumulation and ablation gradients that roughly reproduced the
   geomorphic reconstructions of glacial extent and ice thickness suggested
   extremely cold (T-July similar to 0 degrees C at the glacier terminus)
   and dry (similar to 10\% to 20\% of today's precipitation) climatic
   conditions. Forcing the numerical simulations with warmer and wetter
   conditions that better matched LGM climate proxy records yielded a
   glacier on average 500 to 700m thicker than geomorphic reconstructions.
   Mass balance gradients also controlled ice velocities, fluxes, and
   sliding speeds. These gradients, however, had only a small effect on
   basal conditions. All simulations indicated that basal ice reached the
   pressure melting point over much of the Rhine and Linth piedmont lobes,
   and also in the glacial valleys that fed these lobes. Only the outer
   margin of the lobes, bedrock highs beneath the lobes, and Alpine valleys
   at high elevations in the accumulation zone remained cold based. The
   Rhine glacier was thus polythermal. Sliding speed estimated with a
   linear sliding rule ranged from 20 to 100ma(-1) in the lobes and 50 to
   250ma(-1) in Alpine valleys. Velocity ratios (sliding to surface speeds)
   were > 80\% in lobes and similar to 60\% in valleys. Basal shear stress
   was very low in the lobes (0.03-0.1MPa) and much higher in Alpine
   valleys (> 0.2MPa). In these valleys, viscous strain heating was a
   dominant source of heat, particularly when shear rates in the ice
   increased due to flow constrictions, confluences, or flow past large
   bedrock obstacles, contributing locally up to several watts per square
   meter but on average 0.03 to 0.2Wm(-2). Basal friction acted as a heat
   source at the bed of about 0.02Wm(-2), 4 to 6 times less than the
   geothermal heat flow which is locally high (up to 0.12Wm(-2)). In the
   lobes, despite low surface slopes and low basal shear stresses, sliding
   dictated main fluxes of ice, which closely followed bedrock topography:
   ice was channeled in between bedrock highs along troughs, some of which
   coincided with glacially eroded overdeepenings. These sliding conditions
   may have favored glacial erosion by abrasion and quarrying. Our results
   confirmed general earlier findings but provided more insights into the
   detailed flow and basal conditions of the Rhine glacier at the LGM. Our
   model results suggested that the trimline could have been buried by a
   significant thickness of cold ice. These findings have significant
   implications for interpreting trimlines in the Alps and for our
   understanding of ice-climate interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Projections pertaining to future land use and land use change may have
   diverse backgrounds. Often, both local and scientific knowledge
   encompass important pieces of information for such a projection.
   Acknowledging the diversity across the two types of knowledge, we
   investigated their differences and similarities in a twofold case study,
   conducting a participatory mapping (PM) exercise with local wine
   growers, as well as a Multi Criteria Evaluation (MCE) with non-local
   experts from science, government and industry. Hence, we not only
   utilised two different knowledge elicitation methods, but also two types
   of `Knowledges'.
   Within a region dominated by vineyards, and with expected land use
   change, we compared the two results quantitatively, in a participatory
   evaluation workshop, and with annotations gained through the
   participatory mapping exercise. Both methods have their merits, with the
   results from the participatory mapping perceived as being more
   plausible, and the MCE scoring higher in terms of spatial resolution.
   Whilst the participatory mapping yields more and better contextualised
   information, the results from the MCE can be better compared across
   study areas.}},

Title = {{Removal of pharmaceuticals in urban wastewater: High rate algae pond

   processes}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{19-29}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Microalgae biotechnology is a promising tool for many applications,
   including the elimination of nutrients and other contaminants from
   wastewater. In this work, we measured the removal efficiency of two
   wastewater treatment processes: an activated-sludge based conventional
   process and another based on microalgae biotechnology using high-rate
   algae ponds (HRAPs). The latter was tested using two different
   configurations. In the first one, HRAPs were placed after an UASB
   reactor and used as a tertiary treatment to remove nutrients. In the
   second, the UASB reactor was disconnected so the HRAPs were directly fed
   with pretreated wastewater. Additional treatment was performed using
   dissolved air flotation (DAF). The performances of both configurations
   (UASB-HRAP and HRAP-DAF) were compared to that of the conventional line
   including primary and secondary biological treatments and operating in
   parallel within the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Sixty-four
   out of 81 target PhACs were detected in the influent of the WWTP, at an
   average concentration of 223 mu g L-1, whereas 55 and 54 were measured
   in the conventional (14 mu g L-1) and non-conventional (17 mu g L-1)
   effluents. Average removal efficiencies were similar (94 vs. 92\%) for
   both treatment lines when comparing total PhACs concentrations. The
   compositional patterns of the resulting effluents, however, were not,
   suggesting the occurrence of differential removal mechanisms depending
   on the chemicals and wastewater treatments considered. Highly consumed
   compounds such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen were predominant in the
   non conventional effluent (>1 mu g L-1), denoting lower removal than in
   the conventional line. On the other hand, elimination of diclofenac and
   some specific antibiotics and diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) was
   between 15 and 50\% higher using HRAPs. Overall, the efficiency of the
   microalgae technology removing PhACs was found to be comparable to that
   used in conventional WWTP5. This, combined with a higher efficiency
   removing nutrients, shows the potential of HRAP technology for
   wastewater treatment as an alternative (or addition as tertiary
   treatment) to more conventional approaches based on activated sludge.

Title = {{Predicting habitat quality of protected dry grasslands using Landsat
   NDVI phenology}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{447-460}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Dry grasslands are species rich and ecologically valuable habitats that
   have experienced a massive decline in Switzerland during the last
   century due to agricultural intensification and land abandonment.
   Appropriate management is a key factor in maintaining habitat quality of
   the remaining most valuable sites and should thus be an essential part
   of monitoring studies. However, information on management is often
   missing and fine-scale patterns are difficult to assess, especially over
   large areas and for past decades.
   The aim of this study was to predict habitat quality of protected dry
   grasslands in Switzerland. Using a nationwide in-situ vegetation data
   set with plot-based species lists, we derived six habitat quality
   indicators (management tolerance, light availability, nutrient content,
   moisture content and species richness). We then tested how well
   satellite-based phenology metrics, in combination with environmental and
   climate data, can predict these dry grassland habitat quality
   indicators. We expected that the seasonal pattern of vegetation
   activity, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
   would represent local productivity and management patterns, two crucial
   indicators of dry grassland habitat quality. Linear regression analysis
   was conducted to assess the relative importance and ecological
   relationship of different NDVI metrics and other environmental and
   climate predictors for habitat quality. Variance partitioning was
   applied to assess model contributions of the three variable groups which
   represent different data sources for productivity and management.
   Accuracies for the habitat quality prediction models ranged between 34\%
   and 57\% and significant correlations with multiple NDVI metrics were
   found. Including NDVI phonology improved all models by 7-12\%. Single
   contributions of NDVI phenology were highest for management tolerance
   and nutrient content. However, we found high variation of contributions
   between management types. NDVI metrics were highly informative for the
   habitat qualities of abandoned sites, but grazing and mowing reduced or
   even cancelled their predictive power. Moreover, our results demonstrate
   the limitation of single-date NDVI values in predicting habitat quality
   of dry grasslands; in particular pastures and meadows. For monitoring
   applications of dry grasslands, we propose using a combination of NDVI
   metrics, as our results showed that they greatly improve prediction
   results of essential habitat qualities. The Landsat legacy dataset
   facilitates the assessment of habitat changes during past decades and
   can be complemented in the future with higher resolution data, such as
   Sentinel-2, to increase the temporal and spatial resolution so analyses
   are more appropriate for the typically limited size of dry grassland
   habitat sites in Switzerland.}},

Abstract = {{We present here a more complete cosmogenic chronology of Pleistocene
   glacial deposits for the Wind River Range, Wyoming, USA. Fifty-one new
   and thirty-nine re-calculated Be-10 and Al-26 exposure ages from Sinks
   and North Fork canyons, Stough Basin, Cirque of the Towers and the
   Temple Lake valley allow us to more tightly constrain the timing and
   sequence of glacial alloformations in the southern portion of the range.
   Moraines, diamicts and bedrock exposures here have previously been
   correlated with as many as five Pleistocene and four Holocene glacial
   events. Exposure ages from Pleistocene alloformations associated with
   trunk glaciers in Sinks Canyon and North Fork Canyon generally confirm
   earlier age estimates. Cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN, Be-10 and Al-26)
   ages from moraines and striated bedrock surfaces previously mapped as
   Pinedale correspond to MIS2, while boulder exposure ages from moraines
   mapped as Bull Lake correspond generally to MIS5-MIS6. Geomorphic data
   from a moraine previously mapped as Younger pre-Sacagawea Ridge appears
   to correspond most closely to the Sacagawea Ridge glacial episode
   (MIS-16), but the uncertainty of a single Be-10 exposure age suggests
   the unit could be as young as MIS-10 or as old as MIS-18. Boulders from
   a diamict on Table Mountain previously reported as Older pre-Sacagawea
   Ridge yield two Be-10 exposure ages that suggest the presence of Early
   Pleistocene glacial activity here possibly older than 1-2 Ma (>MIS-30).
   Bedrock exposure ages within Sinks Canyon suggest the Pinedale valley
   glacier had retreated from the floor of Sinks Canyon to above PopoAgie
   Falls by ca. 15.3 ka. Cirque glaciers in Stough Basin appear to have
   retreated behind their riegels by ca. 16 ka, which suggests the cirque
   glaciers were decoupling across their riegels from the valley glaciers
   below at this time, prior to their readvance to form Lateglacial
   moraines.
   New Be-10 boulder exposure ages from moraines previously correlated to
   the Temple Lake and Alice Lake allostratigraphic units in the cirques of
   Stough Basin and Cirque of the Towers show general equivalence to the
   stadial event just prior to the onset of the Bolling interstadial
   (17.5-14.7 ka) and to the Intra-Allerod Cold Period Younger Dryas
   stadial phase (13.9-11.7 ka), respectively. From this evidence, the
   Temple Lake Alloformation of the Wind River Mountains now should
   correspond to the INTIMATE GS-2.1a (Oldest Dryas) stadial event while
   the Alice Lake Alloformation should correspond to the INTIMATE GS-2
   stadial (IACP-Younger Dryas). Thus, we consider that evidence no longer
   exists for early-to mid-Holocene glacial events in the southern Wind
   River Range. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{189}},
Pages = {{898-909}},

Abstract = {{Approximately half of today's annual worldwide crop yields can be
   attributed to the application of mineral fertilizers. Globally, we rely
   and depend on additional yields as a cornerstone of present and future
   global food security. In areas with very low nutrient loads, subsidies
   for appropriate and responsible fertilizer use may help farmers to
   increase their yields and improve soil fertility. In many countries of
   the world, fertilizer subsidies are applied as direct payments; however,
   they have also become an environmental risk factor. We deliberate in
   what way(s) maximizing the farmer's economic yield conflicts with
   maximizing societal interests. We show (mathematically) that, from the
   perspective of a single farmer, under the assumption that crop yields
   increase monotonically with the application of fertilizers, any
   fertilizer subsidy provides an economic incentive to increase the
   application of fertilizer, independent of the amount that has already
   been applied. We suggest feebate systems (i.e., fee- and rebate-based
   mechanisms like penalty taxes and subsidies based on a specific
   reference point or borderline) as an economic strategy for regulating
   both over- and under-fertilization. This acknowledges the various roles
   that subsidies have played historically, ranging from agricultural
   systems that have generally over-fertilized, such as urban agriculture
   in China, Vietnam, or Indonesia, to countries where fertilizer subsidies
   are provided to compensate for significant land degradation. In order to
   connect feebates to fertilization based on a sustainable reference or
   borderline, we provide a conceptual, multilevel environmental and
   sustainability assessment that is linked to conventional and
   market-based economic means, such as farm-specific feebates or cap and

Abstract = {{This article describes and compares methods for simulating the component
   counts of random logarithmic combinatorial structures such as
   permutations and mappings. We exploit the Feller coupling for simulating
   permutations to provide a very fast method for simulating logarithmic
   assemblies more generally. For logarithmic multisets and selections,
   this approach is replaced by an acceptance rejection method based on a
   particular conditioning relationship that represents the distribution of
   the combinatorial structure as that of independent random variables
   conditioned on a weighted sum. We show how to improve its acceptance
   rate. We illustrate the method by estimating the probability that a
   random mapping has no repeated component sizes, and establish the
   asymptotic distribution of the difference between the number of
   components and the number of distinct component sizes for a very general
   class of logarithmic structures. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The pattern of the varying climatic conditions in southern Europe over
   the last million years is well known from isotope studies on deep-ocean
   sediment cores and the long pollen records that have been produced for
   lacustrine and marine sedimentary sequences from Greece, Italy and the
   Iberian margin. However, although relative glacial and interglacial
   intensities are well studied, there are still few proxies that permit
   quantitative terrestrial temperature and precipitation reconstruction.
   In this context, fauna-based climate reconstructions based on evidence
   preserved in archaeological or palaeontological sites are of great
   interest, even if they only document short windows of that climate
   variability, because (a) they provide a range of temperature and
   precipitation estimates that are understandable in comparison with
   present climate; (b) they may allow the testing of predicted temperature
   changes under scenarios of future climate change; and (c) quantitative
   temperature and precipitation estimates for past glacials and
   interglacials for specific regions/latitudes can help to understand
   their effects on flora, fauna and hominids, as they are directly
   associated with those cultural and/or biological events. Moreover such
   reconstructions can bring further arguments to the discussion about
   important climatic events like the Mid-Bruhnes Event, a climatic
   transition between moderate warmths and greater warmths during
   interglacials. In this paper we review a decade of amphibian- and
   reptile-based climate reconstructions carried out for the Iberian
   Peninsula using the Mutual Ecogeographic Range method in order to
   present a regional synthesis from MIS 22 to MIS 6, discuss the climate
   pattern in relation to the Mid-Bruhnes Event and the thermal amplitude
   suggested by these estimates and finally to identify the chronological
   gaps that have still to be investigated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Design flood estimates for a given return period are required in both
   gauged and ungauged catchments for hydraulic design and risk
   assessments. Contrary to classical design estimates, synthetic design
   hydrographs provide not only information on the peak magnitude of events
   but also on the corresponding hydrograph volumes together with the
   hydrograph shapes. In this study, we tested different regionalization
   approaches to transfer parameters of synthetic design hydrographs from
   gauged to ungauged catchments. These approaches include classical
   regionalization methods such as linear regression techniques, spatial
   methods, and methods based on the formation of homogeneous regions. In
   addition to these classical approaches, we tested nonlinear regression
   models not commonly used in hydrological regionalization studies, such
   as random forest, bagging, and boosting. We found that parameters
   related to the magnitude of the design event can be regionalized well
   using both linear and nonlinear regression techniques using catchment
   area, length of the main channel, maximum precipitation intensity, and
   relief energy as explanatory variables. The hydrograph shape, however,
   was found to be more difficult to regionalize due to its high
   variability within a catchment. Such variability might be better
   represented by looking at flood-type specific synthetic design
   hydrographs.}},

Title = {{Additions to the pteridoflora of Tabasco, Mexico: the importance of the
   humid montane forest}},
Journal = {{ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{7-18}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims: The ejido Villa de Guadalupe of the municipality of
   Huimanguillo, Tabasco, contains the only fragment of humid montane
   forest in the state, which has been little explored floristically. This
   study is an addition to those previously published, where reports of new
   records increase considerably the richness of fern species known so far
   for Tabasco state. The main objective is to update the knowledge of the
   pteridophyte flora of this state, emphasizing the importance of the
   humid montane forest.
   Methods: Epiphytic and terrestrial fern collections were made randomly
   on the north and northeast face of the Las Flores mountain (450-1000 m
   a.s.l.)in the municipality of Huimanguillo. Specimens were identified
   mainly by dichotomous keys and distributed to national and foreign
   herbaria.
   Key results: A total of 64 species of ferns and lycopods were recorded.
   The best represented families were Polypodiaceae, Dryopteridaceae and
   Hymenophyllaceae. We highlight the records of 30 species that had not
   previously been reported in the state of Tabasco. Even of the genera
   Cochlidium, Elaphoglossum, Hypolepis, Odontosoria, Parapolystichum,
   Polytaenium, Saccoloma and Sphaeropteris, this is the first report for
   the state.
   Conclusions: The new additions to the pteridophyte flora of Tabasco lead
   to a count of 169 species for the state, which updates the information
   known so far (137 species) and shows the need of continued regional
   floristic inventories. The present study represents one of the few
   published papers that document the richness of a specific taxonomic
   group in the humid montane forest of the state.}},

Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1168+}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It is unclear why sexually reproducing isogamous species frequently
   contain just two self-incompatible mating types. Deterministic theory
   suggests that since rare novel mating types experience a selective
   advantage (by virtue of their many potential partners), the number of
   mating types should consistently grow. However, in nature, species with
   thousands of mating types are exceedingly rare. Several competing
   theories for the predominance of species with two mating types exist,
   yet they lack an explanation for how many are possible and in which
   species to expect high numbers. Here, we present a theoretical null
   model that explains the distribution of mating type numbers using just
   three biological parameters: mutation rate, population size and the rate
   of sex. If the number of mating types results from a mutation-extinction
   balance, the rate of sexual reproduction plays a crucial role. If sex is
   facultative and rare (a very common combination in isogamous species),
   mating type diversity will remain low. In this rare sex regime, small
   fitness differences between the mating types lead to more frequent
   extinctions, further lowering mating type diversity. We also show that
   the empirical literature supports the role of drift and facultativeness
   of sex as a determinant of mating type dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The plant vacuole is a cellular compartment that is essential to plant
   development and growth. Often plant vacuoles accumulate specialized
   metabolites, also called secondary metabolites, which constitute
   functionally and chemically diverse compounds that exert in planta many
   essential functions and improve the plant's fitness. These metabolites
   provide, for example, chemical defense against herbivorous and pathogens
   or chemical attractants (color and fragrance) to attract pollinators.
   The chemical composition of the vacuole is dynamic, and is altered
   during development and as a response to environmental changes. To some
   extent these alterations rely on vacuolar transporters, which import and
   export compounds into and out of the vacuole, respectively. During the
   past decade, significant progress was made in the identification and
   functional characterization of the transporters implicated in many
   aspects of plant specialized metabolism. Still, deciphering the
   molecular players underlying such processes remains a challenge for the
   future. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the most
   recent achievements in this field.}},

   taxonomic varieties of C. caribaea. Sampling included nuclear ribosomal
   internal transcribed spacer sequences from 489 Robinieae accessions
   representing all varieties of C. caribaea and 38 of the 40 species of
   Coursetia, in addition to chloroplast trnD-trnT sequences from 186
   accessions. Separate and combined phylogenetic analyses resolved a Glade
   of conspecific accessions of the Bolivian C. caribaea var. astragalina
   as sister to the central Andean Coursetia grandiflora Glade. Also
   distantly related to Coursetia caribaea var. caribaea accessions were
   those of the coastal Oaxacan C. caribaea var. pacifica, which formed the
   sister Glade to accessions of the central Andean C. caribaea var.

   lineages, 11, 7.7, and 7.7 Ma, respectively, contrasted to the estimated
   mean ages of the corresponding crown clades of 0, 0, and 1.5 Ma. The
   contrasting stem and crown ages suggest that these taxa, appropriately
   ranked as species, Coursetia astragalina, Coursetia diversifolia, and
   Coursetia ochroleuca, each have persisted over evolutionary time frames
   as distinct geographically localized populations in seasonally dry
   tropical forests and woodlands.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput sequencing is a powerful tool, but suffers biases and
   errors that must be accounted for to prevent false biological
   conclusions. Such errors include batch effects; technical errors only
   present in subsets of data due to procedural changes within a study. If
   overlooked and multiple batches of data are combined, spurious
   biological signals can arise, particularly if batches of data are
   correlated with biological variables. Batch effects can be minimized
   through randomization of sample groups across batches. However, in
   long-term or multiyear studies where data are added incrementally, full
   randomization is impossible, and batch effects may be a common feature.
   Here, we present a case study where false signals of selection were
   detected due to a batch effect in a multiyear study of Alpine ibex
   (Capra ibex). The batch effect arose because sequencing read length
   changed over the course of the project and populations were added
   incrementally to the study, resulting in nonrandom distributions of
   populations across read lengths. The differences in read length caused
   small misalignments in a subset of the data, leading to false variant
   alleles and thus false SNPs. Pronounced allele frequency differences
   between populations arose at these SNPs because of the correlation
   between read length and population. This created highly statistically
   significant, but biologically spurious, signals of selection and false
   associations between allele frequencies and the environment. We
   highlight the risk of batch effects and discuss strategies to reduce the
   impacts of batch effects in multiyear high-throughput sequencing
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Biological systems consist of elements that interact within and across
   hierarchical levels. For example, interactions among genes determine
   traits of individuals, competitive and cooperative interactions among
   individuals influence population dynamics, and interactions among
   species affect the dynamics of communities and ecosystem processes. Such
   systems can be represented as hierarchical networks, but can have
   complex dynamics when interdependencies among levels of the hierarchy
   occur. We propose integrating ecological and evolutionary processes in
   hierarchical networks to explore interdependencies in biological
   systems. We connect gene networks underlying predator-prey trait
   distributions to food webs. Our approach addresses longstanding
   questions about how complex traits and intraspecific trait variation
   affect the interdependencies among biological levels and the stability
   of meta-ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization is increasingly recognized as a potent evolutionary force.
   Although additive genetic variation and novel combinations of parental
   genes theoretically increase the potential for hybrid species to adapt,
   few empirical studies have investigated the adaptive potential within a
   hybrid species. Here, we address whether genomic contingencies,
   adaptation to climate, or diet best explain divergence in beak
   morphology using genomically diverged island populations of the
   homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow Passer italiae from Crete, Corsica, and
   Sicily. Populations vary significantly in beak morphology both between
   and within islands of origin. Temperature seasonality best explains
   population divergence in beak size. Interestingly, beak shape along all
   significant dimensions of variation was best explained by annual
   precipitation, genomic composition, and their interaction, suggesting a
   role for contingencies. Moreover, beak shape similarity to a parent
   species correlates with proportion of the genome inherited from that
   species, consistent with the presence of contingencies. In conclusion,
   adaptation to local conditions and genomic contingencies arising from
   putatively independent hybridization events jointly explain beak
   morphology in the Italian sparrow. Hence, hybridization may induce
   contingencies and restrict evolution in certain directions dependent on
   the genetic background.}},

Abstract = {{Existing approaches to assess the economic impact of climate policies
   tend to overlook the financial sector and to focus only on direct
   effects of policies on the specific institutional sector they target,
   neglecting possible feedbacks between sectors, thus, underestimating the
   overall policy effect. To fill in this gap, we develop a methodology
   based on financial networks, which allows for analyzing the transmission
   throughout the economy of positive or negative shocks induced by the
   introduction of specific climate policies. We apply the methodology to
   empirical data of the Euro Area to identify the feedback loops between
   the financial sector and the real economy both through direct and
   indirect chains of financial exposures across multiple financial
   instruments. By focusing on climate policy-induced shocks that affect
   directly either the banking sector or non-financial firms, we analyze
   the reinforcing feedback loops that could amplify the effects of shocks
   on the financial sector and then cascade on the real economy. Our
   analysis helps to understand the conditions for virtuous or vicious
   cycles to arise in the climate-finance nexus and to provide a
   comprehensive assessment of the economic impact of climate policies.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and monitoring pressures on ecosystems and their
   consequences for ecosystem services (ES) is essential for management
   decisions and verification of progress towards national and
   international policies (e.g. Aichi Biodiversity Targets, Sustainable
   Development Goals). Remote sensing (RS) offers a unique capability to
   assess ES systematically and regularly across spatial and temporal
   scales. We aim to evaluate the benefits of RS to monitor spatio-temporal
   variations of ES by assessing several ES in Switzerland between 2004 and
   2014. We coupled mechanistic ES models and RS data to estimate time
   series of three regulating (i.e. carbon dioxide regulation (CO2R), soil
   erosion prevention (SEP), and air quality regulation (AQR)) and one
   cultural ES (recreational hiking (RH)). The resulting ES were used to
   assess spatial and temporal changes, trade-offs and synergies of ES
   potential supply and flow in Switzerland between 2004 and 2014.
   Resulting ES trends showed diverse spatial patterns across Switzerlind
   with largest changes in CO2R and AQR. ES interactions revealed a scale
   and elevation dependency. We identified weak to strong synergies between
   all ES combinations except for trade-offs between CO2R AQR and AQR RH at
   Swiss scale. Spatially, all ES interactions revealed a heterogeneous mix
   of synergies and trade-offs within Switzerland.
   Our results demonstrate the strength of RS for systematic and regular
   spatio-temporal ES monitoring and contribute insights to the large
   potential of RS, which will be extended with future Earth observation
   missions. Derived spatially explicit ES information will facilitate
   decision-making in landscape planning and conservation and will allow
   examining progress towards environmental policies.}},

Abstract = {{Light-absorbing impurities (LAI) can darken snow and ice surfaces,
   reduce snow/ice albedo and accelerate melt. Efforts to allocate the
   relative contribution of different LAI to snow/ice albedo reductions
   have been limited by uncertainties in the optical properties of LAI. We
   developed a new method to measure LAI spectral reflectance at the
   submicron scale by modifying a Hyperspectral Imaging Microscope
   Spectrometer (HIMS). We present the instrument's internal calibration,
   and the overall small influence of a particle's orientation on its
   measured reflectance spectrum. We validated this new method through the
   comparison with a field spectroradiometer by measuring different
   standard materials. Measurements with HIMS at the submicron scale and
   the bulk measurements of the same standard materials with the field
   spectroradiometer are in good agreement with an average deviation
   between the spectra of 3.2\% for the 400-1000 nm wavelength range. The
   new method was used (1) to identify BC (black carbon), mineral dust
   including hematite and the humic substances present in an environmental
   sample from Plaine Morte glacier and (2) to collect the individual
   reflectance spectra of each of these types of impurity. The results

Abstract = {{Subjective perception of air pollution is important and can have impacts
   on health in its own rights, can lead to protective behaviour, or it can
   be leveraged to engage citizens and stakeholders in support of cleaner
   air policies. The aim of the current analysis was to examine
   associations between level of concern over health effects of air
   pollution and personal and environmental factors. In seven European
   cities, 7622 adult participants were recruited to complete an online
   questionnaire on travel and physical activity behaviour, perceptions and
   attitudes on active mobility and the environment, and sociodemographics.
   Air pollution at the home address was determined using Europe-wide PM2.5
   and NO2 land use regression models. Mixed effects logistic regression
   was used to model concern over air pollution (worried versus not
   worried; city as random effect). Fifty-eight percent of participants
   were worried over health effects of air pollution with large differences
   across cities (Antwerp 78\%, Barcelona 81\%, London 64\%, Orebro 11\%,
   Rome 72\%, Vienna 43\%, Zurich 33\%). Linking mean modelled air
   pollution to mean level of concern per city gave a good correlation for
   NO2 (r(2) = 0.75), and a lower correlation for PM2.5 (r(2) = 0.49). In
   the regression model, sex, having children in the household, levels of
   physical activity, and NO2 at the home address were significantly linked
   to individual concern over health effects of air pollution. We found
   that NO2 but not PM2.5 at the home address was associated with concern
   over health effects of air pollution.}},

Title = {{Transient facilitation of resprouting shrubs in fire-prone habitats}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{475-483}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fires play a crucial role mediating species interactions in the
   Mediterranean Basin, with one prominent example being the nursing effect
   of post-fire resprouting shrubs on tree recruits, which then outcompete
   their benefactors throughout succession. Yet, the community structuring
   role of resprouting shrubs as potential facilitators of post-fire
   recruiting subshrub species, which are commonly outcompeted in late
   post-fire stages, has been overlooked. The aims of this work were to
   investigate (i) whether proximity to resprouting shrubs increased the
   demographic performance of a fire-adapted carnivorous subshrub and (ii)
   whether mature shrubs negatively affected the performance of established
   plants through interference with prey capture.
   To evaluate the facilitative effects of resprouting shrubs, we sowed
   seeds of Drosophyllum lusitanicum, a carnivorous, seeder pyrophyte, into
   two microhabitats in recently burned heathland patches defined by
   proximity to resprouting shrubs. We monitored key demographic rates of
   emerged seedlings for 2 years. To test for competitive effects of shrubs
   on plant performance at a later habitat regeneration stage, we placed
   greenhouse-reared, potted plants into distinct microhabitats in
   neighboring burned and unburned heathland patches and monitored prey
   capture. Both experiments were performed in the Aljibe Mountains at the
   Northern Strait of Gibraltar and were replicated in 2 years.
   Resprouting shrubs significantly improved survival, juvenile size and
   flowering probability compared with open microhabitats, and had no
   significantly negative effects on the growth of recruits. Prey capture
   was significantly lower in unburned heathland patches compared with
   burned ones, thus partly explaining the decrease in survival of
   Drosophyllum individuals in mature heathlands. However, microhabitat did
   not affect prey capture. Our findings suggest that not only periodic
   fires, removing biomass in mature stands, but also resprouting
   neighbors, increasing establishment success after fire, may be important
   for the viability of early successional pyrophytes.}},

Abstract = {{Recreation is a basic human need and therefore must be considered in
   spatial planning, which requires spatially explicit mapping of the
   recreation suitability of a landscape. The current methods for this type
   of mapping have limitations: On one hand, widely used expert-based
   models for large scale suitability assessments often suffer from
   discrepancies between the mapped values from expert assessment and
   actual user preferences. On the other hand, elicitation of personal
   preferences of potential users is complex and time-consuming, and their
   applicability to larger scales is limited.
   In this paper, we demonstrate the development of a spatially explicit
   model for the recreation suitability of the riverine zone that
   integrates the preferences of the users with an expert-based modeling
   process. First, we conducted an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with
   experts to generate four different model variants based on physical
   variables. These model variants differ in terms of the strength of the
   influence of the variables on the recreation suitability. Second, an
   online survey was used to gather data on user preferences for various
   river sections with regard to recreation. A comparison of the expert
   model results with the preferences of the potential users shows a clear
   correlation between one model variant and the users' preferences. This
   result suggests that it is possible to elaborate an expert model which
   corresponds to the preferences of users.
   We made the model results available for the planning and development of
   the riverine zone in the canton of Zurich. To this end, they were
   integrated in a decision support platform together with other
   planning-relevant information. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Unintended Side Effects of the Digital Transition: European Scientists'
   Messages from a Proposition-Based Expert Round Table}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We present the main messages of a European Expert Round Table (ERT) on
   the unintended side effects (unseens) of the digital transition.
   Seventeen experts provided 42 propositions from ten different
   perspectives as input for the ERT. A full-day ERT deliberated
   communalities and relationships among these unseens and provided
   suggestions on (i) what the major unseens are; (ii) how rebound effects
   of digital transitioning may become the subject of overarching research;
   and (iii) what unseens should become subjects of transdisciplinary
   theory and practice processes for developing socially robust
   orientations. With respect to the latter, the experts suggested that the
   ownership, economic value, use and access of data and, related to this,
   algorithmic decision-making call for transdisciplinary processes that
   may provide guidelines for key stakeholder groups on how the responsible
   use of digital data can be developed. A cluster-based content analysis
   of the propositions, the discussion and inputs of the ERT, and a
   theoretical analysis of major changes to levels of human systems and the
   human-environment relationship resulted in the following greater
   picture: The digital transition calls for redefining economy, labor,
   democracy, and humanity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based machines may
   take over major domains of human labor, reorganize supply chains, induce
   platform economics, and reshape the participation of economic actors in
   the value chain. (Digital) Knowledge and data supplement capital, labor,
   and natural resources as major economic variables. Digital data and
   technologies lead to a post-fuel industry (post-) capitalism.
   Traditional democratic processes can be (intentionally or
   unintentionally) altered by digital technologies. The unseens in this
   field call for special attention, research and management. Related to
   the conditions of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development (humanity),
   the ubiquitous, global, increasingly AI-shaped interlinkage of almost
   every human personal, social, and economic activity and the exposure to
   indirect, digital, artificial, fragmented, electronically mediated data
   affect behavioral, cognitive, psycho-neuro-endocrinological processes on
   the level of the individual and thus social relations (of groups and
   families) and culture, and thereby, the essential quality and character
   of the human being (i.e., humanity). The findings suggest a need for a
   new field of research, i.e., focusing on sustainable digital societies
   and environments, in which the identification, analysis, and management
   of vulnerabilities and unseens emerging in the sociotechnical digital
   transition play an important role.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclical parthenogenesis presents an interesting challenge for the study
   of sex allocation, as individuals' allocation decisions involve both the
   choice between sexual and asexual reproduction, and the choice between
   sons and daughters. Male production is therefore expected to depend on
   ecological and evolutionary drivers of overall investment in sex, and
   those influencing male reproductive value during sexual periods. We
   manipulated experimental populations, and made repeated observations of
   natural populations over their growing season, to disentangle effects of
   population density and the timing of sex from effects of adult sex ratio
   on sex allocation in cyclically parthenogenetic Daphnia magna. Male
   production increased with population density, the major ecological
   driver of sexual reproduction; however, this response was dampened when
   the population sex ratio was more male-biased. Thus, in line with sex
   ratio theory, we show that D.magna adjust offspring sex allocation in
   response to the current population sex ratio.}},

   conceptual framework and experimental implementation}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The widely observed positive relationship between plant diversity and
   ecosystem functioning is thought to be substantially driven by
   complementary resource use of plant species. Recent work suggests that
   biotic interactions among plants and between plants and soil organisms
   drive key aspects of resource use complementarity. Here, we provide a
   conceptual framework for integrating positive biotic interactions across
   guilds of organisms, more specifically between plants and mycorrhizal
   types, to explain resource use complementarity in plants and its
   consequences for plant competition. Our overarching hypothesis is that
   ecosystem functioning increases when more plant species associate with
   functionally dissimilar mycorrhizal fungi because differing mycorrhizal
   types will increase coverage of habitat space for and reduce competition
   among plants. We introduce a recently established field experiment
   (MyDiv) that uses different pools of tree species that associate with
   either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi to create orthogonal
   experimental gradients in tree species richness and mycorrhizal
   associations and present initial results. Finally, we discuss options
   for future mechanistic studies on resource use complementarity within
   MyDiv. We show how mycorrhizal types and biotic interactions in MyDiv
   can be used in the future to test novel questions regarding the
   mechanisms underlying biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships.}},

Title = {{Predicting Missing Values in Spatio-Temporal Remote Sensing Data}},

Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Continuous, consistent, and long time-series from remote sensing are
   essential to monitoring changes on Earth's surface. However, analyzing
   such data sets is often challenging due to missing values introduced by
   cloud cover, missing orbits, sensor geometry artifacts, and so on. We
   propose a new and accurate spatio-temporal prediction method to replace
   missing values in remote sensing data sets. The method exploits the
   spatial coherence and temporal seasonal regularity that are inherent in
   many data sets. The key parts of the method are: 1) the adaptively
   chosen spatio-temporal subsets around missing values; 2) the ranking of
   images within the subsets based on a scoring algorithm; 3) the
   estimation of empirical quantiles characterizing the missing values; and
   4) the prediction of missing values through quantile regression. One
   advantage of quantile regression is the robustness to outliers, which
   enables more accurate parameter retrieval in the analysis of remote
   sensing data sets. In addition, we provide bootstrap-based
   quantification of prediction uncertainties. The proposed prediction
   method was applied to a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data set
   from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and assessed with
   realistic test data sets featuring between 20\% and 50\% missing values.
   Validation against established methods showed that the proposed method
   has a good performance in terms of the root-mean-squared prediction
   error and significantly outperforms its competitors. This paper is
   accompanied by the open-source R package gapfill, which provides a
   flexible, fast, and ready-to-use implementation of the method.}},

Title = {{Habitat filtering determines the functional niche occupancy of plant

Abstract = {{How the patterns of niche occupancy vary from species-poor to
   species-rich communities is a fundamental question in ecology that has a
   central bearing on the processes that drive patterns of biodiversity. As
   species richness increases, habitat filtering should constrain the
   expansion of total niche volume, while limiting similarity should
   restrict the degree of niche overlap between species. Here, by
   explicitly incorporating intraspecific trait variability, we investigate
   the relationship between functional niche occupancy and species richness
   at the global scale. We assembled 21 datasets worldwide, spanning
   tropical to temperate biomes and consisting of 313 plant communities
   representing different growth forms. We quantified three key niche
   occupancy components (the total functional volume, the functional
   overlap between species and the average functional volume per species)
   for each community, related each component to species richness, and
   compared each component to the null expectations. As species richness
   increased, communities were more functionally diverse (an increase in
   total functional volume), and species overlapped more within the
   community (an increase in functional overlap) but did not more finely
   divide the functional space (no decline in average functional volume).
   Null model analyses provided evidence for habitat filtering (smaller
   total functional volume than expectation), but not for limiting
   similarity (larger functional overlap and larger average functional
   volume than expectation) as a process driving the pattern of functional
   niche occupancy.Synthesis. Habitat filtering is a widespread process
   driving the pattern of functional niche occupancy across plant
   communities and coexisting species tend to be more functionally similar
   rather than more functionally specialized. Our results indicate that
   including intraspecific trait variability will contribute to a better
   understanding of the processes driving patterns of functional niche
   occupancy.}},

Abstract = {{Plant functional traits may explain the positive relationship between
   species richness and ecosystem functioning, but species-level trait
   variation in response to growth conditions is often ignored in
   trait-based predictions of community performance. In a large grassland
   biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment), we measured traits on plants
   grown as solitary individuals, in monocultures or in mixtures. We
   calculated two measures of community-level trait composition, i.e.,
   community-weighted mean traits (CWM) and trait diversity (Rao's
   quadratic entropy; FD) based on different contexts in which traits were
   measured (trait origins). CWM and FD values of the different measurement
   origins were then compared regarding their power to predict community
   biomass production and biodiversity effects quantified with the additive
   partitioning method. Irrespective of trait origin, models combining CWM
   and FD values as predictors best explained community biomass and
   biodiversity effects. CWM values based on monoculture, mixture-mean or
   community-specific trait data were similarly powerful predictors, but
   predictions became worse when trait values originated from
   solitary-grown individuals. FD values based on monoculture traits were
   the best predictors of community biomass and net biodiversity effects,
   while FD values based on community-specific traits were the best
   predictors for complementarity and selection effects. Traits chosen as
   best CWM predictors were not strongly affected by trait origin but
   traits chosen as best FD predictors varied strongly dependent on trait
   origin and altered the predictability of community performance. We
   conclude that by adjusting their functional traits to species richness
   and even specific community compositions, plants can change
   community-level trait compositions, thereby also changing community
   biomass production and biodiversity effects. Incorporation of these
   plastic trait adjustments of plants in trait-based ecology can improve
   its predictive power in explaining biodiversity-ecosystem functioning
   relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Durable resistance against fungal pathogens is highly valuable for
   disease management in agriculture. For its sustainable use, and to avoid
   pathogen adaptation, it is important to understand the underlying
   molecular mechanisms. Many studies on durable disease resistance in
   plants have focused exclusively on the host plant, whereas possible
   reactions and adaptations of pathogens exposed to this type of
   resistance have not been well researched. The wheat Lr34 gene, encoding
   a putative ABC-transporter, provides broad-spectrum and durable
   resistance against multiple fungal pathogens in wheat and is functional
   as a transgene in all major cereals. Lr34-based resistance is partial,
   meaning pathogens can grow and reproduce to some degree on
   Lr34-containing plants. Therefore, Lr34-expressing plants are ideal for
   studying the response of pathogens to partial resistance. Here,
   transcriptomic responses of the two fungal pathogens Blumeria graminis
   f. sp. hordei (barley powdery mildew) and Puccinia triticina (wheat leaf
   rust) during growth on their respective host plants containing Lr34 were
   compared to their responses on control plants without Lr34. Two
   different time points after inoculation were chosen for analysis of
   powdery mildew on barley and one time point for wheat leaf rust.
   Transcriptome analyses revealed that there were no differences in the
   expression patterns of the two pathogens growing on susceptible versus
   partially resistant plants, even though pathogen growth was reduced in
   the presence of Lr34. This reflects the absence of observable reaction
   in the pathogen to the presence of the Lr34 resistance gene and,
   consequently, no major alteration of fungal pathogen metabolism.}},

Title = {{Experimentally simulating warmer and wetter climate additively improves
   rangeland quality on the Tibetan Plateau}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{1486-1497}},

Abstract = {{1. The vast expanses of rangeland on the Tibetan Plateau, which support
   the livelihood of c. 9.8 million local inhabitants, have experienced
   rapid climate warming over the past 50 years. At the same time,
   precipitation has increased in large parts of the Plateau but decreased
   in other parts, particularly in the northwest. These trends are
   predicted to continue into the future. However, their potential effects
   on rangeland quality remain unclear.
   2. We conducted a two-factor field experiment in which we manipulated
   temperature (control or warming by 1.5-1.8 degrees C) and precipitation
   (control or 50\% reduction or increase in rainfall) in an alpine
   grassland on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, starting in 2011. From
   2014 to 2016, we measured forage production and community composition,
   and in 2015 forage quality (crude protein, cell-soluble contents,
   hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and digestibility) was represented by
   seven abundant species.
   3. Overall, warming did not change total forage production at plant
   community level, but increased legume production and decreased
   non-legume forb production. Increased and reduced precipitation enhanced
   and decreased forage production by 18.2\% and 12.9\% respectively.
   Increased precipitation in particular increased grass and sedge
   production, but not legume production.
   4. Forage quality showed species-specific responses to the simulated
   climate changes. At community level, warming and reduced precipitation
   improved forage quality, which were mainly caused by a shift in
   community composition towards more legumes, rather than the direct
   effects of simulated climate changes. Meanwhile, increased precipitation
   did not reduce forage quality, despite the precipitation-induced
   increase in forage production.
   5. Integrating forage production and quality into nutrient production as
   a measure of rangeland quality, we found that warming and increased
   precipitation additively improved rangeland quality, while reduced
   precipitation decreased it.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Rangeland quality, an important ecosystem
   provisioning service, will benefit from a warmer climate on the Tibetan
   Plateau in the regions with a predicted increase in precipitation, but
   not in those regions where precipitation might be reduced in the future.
   We suggest management strategies, including reseeding native legumes,
   establishing sustainable pastures and assisting the exchange of
   harvested forage, to cope with the challenges posed by these different
   climate change scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Abiotic conditions have long been considered essential in structuring
   freshwater macroinvertebrate communities. Ecological drift, dispersal
   and biotic interactions also structure communities, and although these
   mechanisms are more difficult to detect, they may be of equal importance
   in natural communities. Here, we hypothesized that in 10 naturally
   replicated headwater streams in eastern Switzerland, locally dominant
   amphipod species would be associated with differences in environmental
   conditions. We conducted repeated surveys of amphipods and used a
   hierarchical joint species distribution model to assess the influence of
   different drivers on species co-occurrences. The species had unique
   environmental requirements, but a distinct spatial structure in their
   distributions was unrelated to habitat. Species co-occurred much less
   frequently than predicted by the model, which was surprising because
   laboratory and field evidence suggests they are capable of coexisting in
   equal densities. We suggest that niche preemption may limit their
   distribution and that a blocking effect related to the specific linear
   configuration of streams determines which species colonizes and
   dominates a given stream catchment, thus suggesting a new solution a
   long-standing conundrum in freshwater ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous species of marine megafauna are at risk of extinction and
   understanding their genetic population structure and demographic history
   is essential for their conservation. We used mitochondrial DNA and 18
   nuclear microsatellite loci, on the largest genetic dataset compiled to
   date on Australian humpback dolphins (eight sampling sites, 159
   samples), to assess their genetic diversity, gene flow and past
   demographic history along the east coast of Queensland, Australia.
   Levels of genetic diversity were low (mtDNA: h = 0-0.52, pi = 0-0.007;
   nDNA: Ho = 0.27-0.41; AR = 1.7-2.4). Both mitochondrial (Phi(ST) = 0.49,
   P = 0.001) and nuclear markers (F-ST = 0.14, P = 0.001) showed strong
   genetic structure among sampling sites. Four putative populations were
   identified, with little contemporary gene flow (m = 0.017 to 0.047)
   among populations. Genetic divergence follows an isolation-by-distance
   model (r = 0.38, P = 0.0001), with an apparent restriction in gene flow
   occurring at scales of 382,509 km. Estimates of contemporary effective
   population size were low (N-e = 11.5-31.2), with signatures of genetic
   bottlenecks for all putative populations about 50-150 generations ago.
   The current low levels of genetic diversity, gene flow, and effective
   population size in Australian humpback dolphins indicate the effects of
   historical population bottlenecks and/or founder events during the late
   Holocene period (similar to 1250-3750 years ago); probably associated
   with sea level fall and increased intensity of El Nino Southern
   Oscillation-climatic events. Our results raise important conservation
   concerns and emphasize the vulnerability of Australian humpback dolphins
   to stochastic demographic, genetic and environmental processes.
   Conservation strategies should focus on promoting connectivity among
   local populations and reducing direct causes of human related mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Plants are constantly challenged in their natural environment by a range
   of changing conditions. We investigated the acclimation processes and
   adaptive plant responses to various long-term mild changes and compared
   them directly within one experimental set-up. Arabidopsis thaliana
   plants were grown in hydroponic culture for 10 d under controlled
   abiotic stress (15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, salt and osmotic) and in
   nutrient deficiency (nitrate and phosphate). Plant growth was monitored
   and proteomic experiments were performed. Resource allocation between
   tissues altered during the plants' response. The growth patterns and
   induced changes of the proteomes indicated that the underlying
   mechanisms of the adaptation processes are highly specific to the
   respective environmental condition. Our results indicated differential
   regulation of response to salt and osmotic treatment, while the proteins
   in the changed temperature regime showed an inverse,
   temperature-sensitive control. There was a high correlation of protein
   level between the nutrient-deficient treatments, but the enriched
   pathways varied greatly. The proteomic analysis also revealed new
   insights into the regulation of proteins specific to the shoot and the
   root. Our investigation revealed unique strategies of plant acclimation
   to the different applied treatments on a physiological and proteome
   level, and these strategies are quite distinct in tissues below and
   above ground.}},

Abstract = {{One of the key environmental factors affecting plant reproductive
   systems is temperature. Characterising such effects is especially
   relevant for some commercially important genera such as Citrus. In this
   genus, failure of fertilisation results in parthenocarpic fruit
   development and seedlessness, which is a much-prized character. Here, we
   characterise the effects of temperature on flower and ovary development,
   and on pollen-pistil interactions in Comune' clementine (Citrus
   clementina Hort. ex Tan.). We examine flower bud development, invitro
   pollen germination and pollen-pistil interaction at different
   temperatures (15, 20, 25 or 30 degrees C). These temperatures span the
   range from cold' to hot' weather during the flowering season in many
   citrus-growing regions. Temperature had a strong effect on flower and
   ovary development, pollen germination, and pollen tube growth kinetics.
   In particular, parthenocarpic fruit development (indicated by juice
   vesicle growth) was initiated early if flowers were exposed to warmer
   temperatures during anthesis. Exposure to different temperatures during
   flower bud development also alters expression of the
   self-incompatibility reaction. This affects the point in the pistil at
   which pollen tube growth is arrested and confirms the role of sub- and
   supra-optimal temperatures in determining the numbers of pollen tubes
   reaching the ovary.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Theory and experiments strongly support the importance of
   interactive effects of multiple factors shaping biodiversity, although
   their importance rarely has been investigated at biogeographically
   relevant scales. In particular, the importance of higher order
   interactions among environmental factors at such scales is largely
   unknown. We investigated higher order interactions of environmental
   factors to explain diversity patterns in a metacommunity of aquatic
   invertebrates at a biogeographically relevant scale and discuss the
   findings in an environmental management context.
   Location: All major drainage basins in Switzerland (Rhine, Rhone, Ticino
   and Inn; 41,285km(2)).
   Methods: Riverine -diversity patterns at two taxonomic levels (family
   richness of all benthic macroinvertebrates and species richness of
   Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) were examined at 518 sites
   across the basins. We applied a novel machine learning technique to
   detect key three-way interactions of explanatory variables by comparing
   the relative importance of 1,140 three-way combinations for family
   richness and 680 three-way combinations for species richness.
   Results: Relatively few but important three-way interactions were
   meaningful for predicting biodiversity patterns among the numerous
   possible combinations. Specifically, we found that interactions among
   elevational gradient, prevalence of forest coverage in the upstream
   basin and biogeoclimatic regional classification were distinctly
   important.
   Main conclusion: Our results indicated that a high prevalence of
   terrestrial forest generally sustains riverine benthic macroinvertebrate
   diversity, but this relationship varies considerably with biogeoclimatic
   and elevational conditions likely due to community composition of
   forests and macroinvertebrates changing along climatic and geographical
   gradients. An adequate management of riverine ecosystems at relevant
   biogeographical scales requires the identification of such interactions
   and a context-dependent implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity enhances ecosystem functions such as biomass production and
   nutrient cycling. Although the majority of the terrestrial biodiversity
   is hidden in soils, very little is known about the importance of the
   diversity of microbial communities for soil functioning. Here, we tested
   effects of biodiversity on the functioning of methanotrophs, a
   specialized group of soil bacteria that plays a key role in mediating
   greenhouse gas emissions from soils. Using pure strains of
   methanotrophic bacteria, we assembled artificial communities of
   different diversity levels, with which we inoculated sterile soil
   microcosms. To assess the functioning of these communities, we measured
   methane oxidation by gas chromatography throughout the experiment and
   determined changes in community composition and community size at
   several time points by quantitative PCR and sequencing. We demonstrate
   that microbial diversity had a positive overyielding effect on methane
   oxidation, in particular at the beginning of the experiment. This higher
   assimilation of CH4 at high diversity translated into increased growth
   and significantly larger communities towards the end of the study. The
   overyielding of mixtures with respect to CH4 consumption and community
   size were positively correlated. The temporal CH4 consumption profiles
   of strain monocultures differed, raising the possibility that temporal
   complementarity of component strains drove the observed community-level
   strain richness effects; however, the community niche metric we derived
   from the temporal activity profiles did not explain the observed strain
   richness effect. The strain richness effect also was unrelated to both
   the phylogenetic and functional trait diversity of mixed communities.
   Overall, our results suggest that positive
   biodiversity-ecosystem-function relationships show similar patterns
   across different scales and may be widespread in nature. Additionally,
   biodiversity is probably also important in natural methanotrophic
   communities for the ecosystem function methane oxidation. Therefore,
   maintaining soil conditions that support a high diversity of
   methanotrophs may help to reduce the emission of the greenhouse gas
   methane.}},

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{20-29}},

Abstract = {{The ecological niche of a species determines whether a species can
   persist and reproduce in a patch or not. The niche of a species is often
   described using habitat suitability models and indices. Accordingly, one
   may expect tight links between demography, phenotypes of individuals,
   population size, and habitat suitability. However, such links are not
   always found. Here, we study the relationship between a habitat
   suitability index that is commonly used for conservation assessments and
   metrics describing the performance at the level of populations and
   individuals. Using data from a metapopulation of a pond-breeding
   amphibian, the Great Crested Newt (Triturus cristatus), we show that
   habitat suitability predicts population size but not body condition.
   Ponds with higher suitability had a higher population size of newts,
   whereas population size correlated negatively with body condition of
   individuals. Our results are in line with previous studies showing no
   straightforward relationship between habitat suitability and body
   condition (a measure of individual performance) and the performance of
   populations. We suggest that a population size-dependent reduction of
   body condition may be a regulatory mechanism in newt populations. (C)

Abstract = {{Polyploidization has played an important role in the speciation and
   diversification of plant species. However, genetic analyses of
   polyploids are challenging because the vast majority of the model
   species are diploids. The allotetraploid Arabidopsis kamchatica, which
   originated through the hybridization of the diploid Arabidopsis halleri
   and Arabidopsis lyrata, is an emerging model system for studying various
   aspects of polyploidy. However, a transgenic method that allows the
   insertion of a gene of interest into A. kamchatica is still lacking. In
   this study, we investigated the early development of pistils in A.
   kamchatica and confirmed the formation of open pistils in young flower
   buds (stages 8-9), which is important for allowing Agrobacterium to
   access female reproductive tissues. We established a simple
   Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip transformation method to transform a
   gene of interest into A. kamchatica by dipping A. kamchatica
   inflorescences bearing many young flower buds into a 5\% sucrose
   solution containing 0.05\% Silwet L-77 and Agrobacterium harboring the
   gene of interest. We showed that a screenable marker comprising
   fluorescence-accumulating seed technology with green fluorescent protein
   was useful for screening the transgenic seeds of two accessions of A.
   kamchatica subsp. kamchatica and an accession of A. kamchatica subsp.
   kawasakiana.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, the genomic revolution has offered the possibility
   to generate tremendous amounts of data that contain valuable information
   on the genetic basis of phenotypic traits, such as those linked to human
   diseases or those that allow for species to adapt to a changing
   environment. Most ecologically relevant traits are controlled by a large
   number of genes with small individual effects on trait variation, but
   that are connected with one another through complex developmental,
   metabolic and biochemical networks. As a result, it has recently been
   suggested that most adaptation events in natural populations are reached
   via correlated changes at multiple genes at a time, for which the name
   polygenic adaptation has been coined. The current challenge is to
   develop methods to extract the relevant information from genomic data to
   detect the signature of polygenic evolutionary change. The symposium
   entitled ``Detecting the Genomic Signal of Polygenic Adaptation and the
   Role of Epistasis in Evolution{''} held in 2017 at the University of
   Zurich aimed at reviewing our current state of knowledge. In this
   review, we use the talks of the invited speakers to summarize some of
   the most recent developments in this field.}},

Title = {{MIXED MATING IN HOMOSTYLOUS SPECIES: GENETIC AND EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE
   FROM AN ALPINE PLANT WITH VARIABLE HERKOGAMY, PRIMULA HALLERI}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{179}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{87-99}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Premise of research. Self-compatibility is a requirement for
   reproductive assurance via selfing and may therefore be beneficial in
   environments with infrequent or unpredictable pollinator service.
   However, self-compatible plants may spatially separate anthers from
   stigmatic surface within flowers (herkogamy), potentially preventing
   autonomous self-pollination while promoting outcrossing. We investigated
   the effects of herkogamy on patterns of mating in a self-compatible,
   homostylous alpine herb, Primula halleri, which evolved from obligately
   outcrossing, heterostylous ancestors. Primula halleri displays
   diminishing herkogamy during anthesis, affecting its capacity for
   self-pollination. Specifically, we tested whether higher herkogamy at
   the end of anthesis (terminal herkogamy) promotes higher outcrossing
   rates at the cost of lower seed set, while lower terminal herkogamy
   ensures seed set via self-pollination at the cost of inbreeding.
   Methodology. We estimated family-and population-level genetic
   outcrossing rates in four populations using microsatellites and derived
   an estimate for inbreeding depression. We tested effects of different
   levels of terminal herkogamy on means and variances of outcrossing
   rates. We also assessed whether seed set was resource or pollen limited.
   We interpreted results in light of previously published data on seed set
   with and without pollinator-exclusion treatment.
   Pivotal results. Population-level outcrossing rates ranged between 0.5
   and 0.8. Outcrossing rates of plants with higher terminal herkogamy had
   similar means but lower variances than those of plants with lower
   terminal herkogamy. This result demonstrates that separation between
   sexual organs larger than 1 mm in mature flowers favors outbreeding,
   while below this threshold, delayed selfing ensures reproduction.
   Conclusions. Contrary to long-held notions about the association of
   homostyly and selfing, we provide new genetic evidence that the
   homostylous P. halleri adopts a mixed mating system due to variable
   herkogamy. Moreover, our results support a trade-off between seed number
   and seed quality effected through variation in herkogamy, illustrating
   that herkogamy affects multiple aspects of reproductive fitness
   simultaneously.}},

Title = {{Shifting relative importance of climatic constraints on land surface
   phenology}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Land surface phenology (LSP), the study of seasonal dynamics of
   vegetated land surfaces from remote sensing, is a key indicator of
   global change, that both responds to and influences weather and climate.
   The effects of climatic changes on LSP depend on the relative importance
   of climatic constraints in specific regions-which are not well
   understood at global scale. Understanding the climatic constraints that
   underlie LSP is crucial for explaining climate change effects on global
   vegetation phenology.
   We used a combination of modelled and remotely-sensed vegetation
   activity records to quantify the interplay of three climatic constraints
   on land surface phenology (namely minimum temperature, moisture
   availability, and photoperiod), as well as the dynamic nature of these
   constraints. Our study examined trends and the relative importance of
   the three constrains at the start and the end of the growing season over
   eight global environmental zones, for the past three decades.
   Our analysis revealed widespread shifts in the relative importance of
   climatic constraints in the temperate and boreal biomes during the
   1982-2011 period. These changes in the relative importance of the three
   climatic constraints, which ranged up to 8\% since 1982 levels, varied
   with latitude and between start and end of the growing season. We found
   a reduced influence of minimum temperature on start and end of season in
   all environmental zones considered, with a biome-dependent effect on
   moisture and photoperiod constraints. For the end of season, we report
   that the influence of moisture has on average increased for both the
   temperate and boreal biomes over 8.99 million km(2). A shifting relative
   importance of climatic constraints on LSP has implications both for
   understanding changes and for improving how they may be modelled at
   large scales.}},

Abstract = {{The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has repeatedly been found to
   influence mate choice of vertebrates, with MHC-dissimilar mates
   typically being preferred over MHC-similar mates. We used horses (Equus
   caballus) to test whether MHC matching also affects male investment into
   ejaculates after short exposure to a female. Semen characteristics
   varied much among stallions. Controlling for this variance with a
   full-factorial within-subject experimental design, we found that a short
   exposure to an MHC-dissimilar mare enhanced male plasma testosterone and
   led to ejaculates with elevated sperm numbers as compared to exposure to
   an MHC-similar mare. Sperm velocity seemed not affected by the
   treatment. Overall genetic similarity between stallions and mares
   (determined from polymorphic microsatellites on 20 different
   chromosomes) played no significant role here. The MHC type of the teaser
   mare also affected characteristics of cold-stored sperm after 24 and 48
   hr. As expected from ejaculate economics, sperm viability was elevated
   after exposure to an MHC-dissimilar mare. However, oxidative stress and
   the percentage of sperm with a high DNA fragmentation were mostly
   increased after exposure to an MHC-dissimilar mare, depending also on
   whether the teaser mare was in oestrous or not. We conclude that males
   can quickly adjust ejaculate quality relative to a female's MHC, and
   that this male reaction to the social environment can also affect
   important characteristics of cold-stored semen.}},

Abstract = {{Biochemical and electrophysiological studies on plant vacuolar
   transporters became feasible in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when
   methods to isolate large quantities of intact vacuoles and purified
   vacuolar membrane vesicles were established. However, with the exception
   of the H+-ATPase and H+-PPase, which could be followed due to their
   hydrolytic activities, attempts to purify tonoplast transporters were
   for a long time not successful. Heterologous complementation, T-DNA
   insertion mutants, and later proteomic studies allowed the next steps,
   starting from the 1990s. Nowadays, our knowledge about vacuolar
   transporters has increased greatly. Nevertheless, there are several
   transporters of central importance that have still to be identified at
   the molecular level or have even not been characterized biochemically.
   Furthermore, our knowledge about regulation of the vacuolar transporters
   is very limited, and much work is needed to get a holistic view about
   the interplay of the vacuolar transportome. The huge amount of
   information generated during the last 35 years cannot be summarized in
   such a review. Therefore, I decided to concentrate on some aspects where
   we were involved during my research on vacuolar transporters, for some
   our laboratories contributed more, while others contributed less.}},

Abstract = {{Leaf litter decomposition is a major ecosystem process that can link
   aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems by flows of nutrients. Biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning research hypothesizes that the global loss of
   species leads to impaired decomposition rates and thus to slower
   recycling of nutrients. Especially in aquatic systems, an understanding
   of diversity effects on litter decomposition is still incomplete.
   Here we conducted an experiment to test two main factors associated with
   global species loss that might influence leaf litter decomposition.
   First, we tested whether mixing different leaf species alters litter
   decomposition rates compared to decomposition of these species in
   monoculture. Second, we tested the effect of the size structure of a
   lotic decomposer community on decomposition rates.
   Overall, leaf litter identity strongly affected decomposition rates, and
   the observed decomposition rates matched measures of metabolic activity
   and microbial abundances. While we found some evidence of a positive
   leaf litter diversity effect on decomposition, this effect was not
   coherent across all litter combinations and the effect was generally
   additive and not synergistic.
   Microbial communities, with a reduced functional and trophic complexity,
   showed a small but significant overall reduction in decomposition rates
   compared to communities with the naturally complete functional and
   trophic complexity, highlighting the importance of a complete microbial
   community on ecosystem functioning.
   Our results suggest that top-down diversity effects of the decomposer
   community on litter decomposition in aquatic systems are of comparable
   importance as bottom-up diversity effects of primary producers.}},

Abstract = {{Lateral roots are determinants of plant root system architecture.
   Besides providing anchorage, they are a plant's means to explore the
   soil environment for water and nutrients. Lateral roots form
   post-embryonically and initiate deep within the root. On its way to the
   surface, the newly formed organ needs to grow through three overlying
   cell layers; the endodermis, cortex and epidermis. A picture is emerging
   that a tight integration of chemical and mechanical signalling between
   the lateral root and the surrounding tissue is essential for proper
   organogenesis. Here we review the latest progress made towards our
   understanding of the fascinating biology underlying lateral root
   emergence in Arabidopsis.}},

Abstract = {{With ongoing global change, life is continuously forced to move to novel
   areas, which leads to dynamically changing species ranges. As dispersal
   is central to range dynamics, factors promoting fast and distant
   dispersal are key to understanding and predicting species ranges. During
   range expansions, genetic variation is depleted at the expanding front.
   Such conditions should reduce evolutionary potential, while increasing
   kin competition. Organisms able to recognise relatives may be able to
   assess increased levels of relatedness at expanding range margins and to
   increase their dispersal in a plastic manner. Using individual-based
   simulations and experimental range expansions of a spider mite, we
   demonstrate that plastic responses to kin structure can be at least as
   important as evolution in driving range expansion speed. Because
   recognition of kin or kind is increasingly documented across the tree of
   life, we anticipate it to be a highly important but neglected driver of
   range expansions.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{7-13}},

Abstract = {{In fire-prone ecosystems, many plant species have specialized mechanisms
   of seed dormancy that ensure a successful recruitment after fire. A
   well-documented mechanism is the germination stimulated by fire-related
   cues, such as heat shock and smoke. However, less is known about the
   role of inhibitory germination signals (e.g. allelopathy) in regulating
   post-fire recruitment. Plant leachates derived from the unburned
   vegetation can enforce dormancy by means of allelopathic compounds,
   acting as a signal of unfavourable (highly competitive) niche for
   germination in pyrophyte species. Here, we assessed the separate effects
   of heat shock and plant leachates on seed germination of Drosophyllum
   lusitanicum, an endangered carnivorous plant endemic to Mediterranean
   fire-prone heathlands. We performed a germination experiment in which
   seeds were subjected to three treatments: (1) 5 min at 100 degrees C,
   (2) watering with plant leachate, and (3) control. Germination rate and
   seed viability was determined after 63 days. Heat shock stimulated seed
   germination in D. lusitanicum while plant leachates had inhibitory
   germination effects without reducing seed viability. Thus, both positive
   and negative signals could be involved in its successful post-fire
   recruitment. Fire would break seed dormancy and stimulate seed
   germination of D. lusitanicum through high temperatures, but also by
   eliminating allelochemical compounds from the soil. These results help
   to understand the population dynamics patterns found for D. lusitanicum
   in natural populations, and highlight the role of fire in the ecology
   and conservation of this endangered species. Seed dormancy imposed by
   plant-derived leachates as an adaptive mechanism should be considered
   more in fire ecology theory.}},

Abstract = {{The most obvious event of leaf senescence is the loss of chlorophyll.
   Chlorophyll degradation proceeds in a well- characterized pathway that,
   although being common to higher plants, yields a species- specific set
   of chlorophyll catabolites, termed phyllobilins. Analysis of chlorophyll
   degradation and phyllobilin accumulation by high- performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) is a valuable tool to investigate senescence
   processes in plants. In this chapter, methods for the extraction,
   separation, and quantification of chlorophyll and its degradation
   products are described. Because of their different physicochemical
   properties, chlorin- type pigments (chlorophylls and magnesium- free
   pheo- pigments) and phyllobilins (linear tetrapyrroles) are analyzed
   separately. Specific spectral properties and polarity differences allow
   the identification of the different classes of known chlorins and
   phyllobilins. The methods provided facilitate the analysis of
   chlorophyll degradation and the identification of chlorophyll
   catabolites in a wide range of plant species, in different tissues, and
   under a variety of physiological conditions that involve loss of
   chlorophyll.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging spectroscopy based methods offer unique capabilities for
   retrieving narrow-band vegetation indices which can be empirically
   related to functional traits of plants. However, in areas with complex
   topography, illumination effects affect the retrieval of such indices
   from high spatial resolution airborne or satellite data. Irradiance
   components at the pixel level are determined by atmospheric composition,
   as well as instantaneous illumination-surface-sensor geometries. An
   accurate pixel-wise description of direct and diffuse irradiance
   components is necessary to perform atmospheric corrections, finally
   resulting in improved surface reflectances and hence products. We assess
   three atmospheric correction strategies, differing in their approaches
   to simulate instantaneous as well as pixel-wise abundances of diffuse
   and direct irradiance. We use physically-based approaches in combination
   with either digital elevation models (DEM), fine resolution digital
   object models (DOM), or 3D modelling output from the Discrete
   Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. The such obtained
   top-of-canopy reflectances at the Laegern test-site in Switzerland, are
   used to assess retrieval improvement for a set of indices (Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index
   (PRI), as well as chlorophyll and carotenoid indices). We demonstrate
   that both, the DOM and the DART based approach, improve the retrievals
   for flat cast-shadows by <= 71\% compared to using a DEM. In dense
   forest areas, improvements are less significant. Remaining key issues
   are related to overestimating surface reflectance under extreme
   illumination conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Predator-prey theory predicts that in the presence of multiple types of
   predators using a common prey, predator facilitation may result as a
   consequence of contrasting prey defense mechanisms, where reducing the
   risk from one predator increases the risk from the other. While predator
   facilitation is well established in natural predator-prey systems,
   little attention has been paid to situations where human hunters compete
   with natural predators for the same prey. Here, we investigate
   hunting-mediated predator facilitation in a hunter-predator-prey system.
   We found that hunter avoidance by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) exposed
   them to increase predation risk by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). Lynx
   responded by increasing their activity and predation on deer, providing
   evidence that superadditive hunting mortality may be occurring through
   predator facilitation. Our results reveal a new pathway through which
   human hunters, in their role as top predators, may affect species
   interactions at lower trophic levels and thus drive ecosystem processes.}},

Abstract = {{The ubiquity of information and communication technologies (ICT) results
   in substantial amounts of energy consumption and thus, CO2-emissions.
   Since software induces the energy consumption of hardware, some reliable
   procedures and tests for measuring software are necessary. We present
   such a method and prove our measurement concept by applying it to two
   software product groups: word processors and content management systems.
   Even though the two groups are very different in terms of their
   requirements, we were successful in the creation of a measurement
   environment that supports the production of reliable, verifiable
   results, allowing the comparison of the energy consumption induced by
   software systems with similar functionality. The method shows viable
   results for desktop and client-server systems, paving the way for
   further setups like e.g. mobile and embedded devices.}},

Abstract = {{How can urban nature contribute to the reduction of chronic stress? We
   twice measured the concentration of the stress hormone cortisol in the
   hair of 85 volunteer gardeners (six months apart), relating cortisol
   level change to (self-reported) characteristics of their recreational
   activities. Both time spent in nature and physical activity led to
   decreases in cortisol, while time spent being idle led to an increase.
   At high levels of present stressors, however, the relationship for time
   spent in nature and for idleness was reversed. Time spent with social
   interaction had no effect on cortisol levels. Our results indicate that
   physical activity is an effective means of mitigating the negative
   effects of chronic stress. The results regarding the time spent in
   nature and time spent being idle are less conclusive, suggesting the
   need for more research. We conclude that if chronic stress cannot be
   abolished by eradicating its sources, public health may take to measures
   to reduce itproviding urban nature being one effective possibility.}},

Abstract = {{The provision of living space as well as financial transfers are
   important elements of functional solidarity between parents and adult
   children in contemporary European societies. However, prior research has
   revealed substantial discrepancies not only within but also between
   countries. Against this background, this paper investigates the
   relevance of money and space transfers and the connections between the
   two forms of support simultaneously using the Survey of Health, Ageing
   and Retirement in Europe. The empirical results indicate that the needs
   of adult children as well as the opportunities of their parents are
   important determinants of support. Furthermore, parents in southern
   European countries with low levels of public family expenditures
   predominantly support their adult children by providing living space,
   whereas parents in northern European countries with more generous
   welfare states give direct financial support. Differences in
   country-specific transfer patterns can theoretically and empirically be
   traced back to welfare state support in general and national housing
   regimes and markets in particular.}},

   a plethora of resistance genes that can be exploited to make wheat more

   from classical breeding to genomics-assisted breeding, which makes use
   of the enormous advancements in DNA sequencing and high-throughput
   molecular marker technologies for wheat improvement. These genomic
   advancements have the potential to transform wheat breeding in the near
   future and to significantly increase the speed and precision at which
   new cultivars can be bred. This review highlights the genomic
   improvements that have been made in wheat and its pathogens over the

Abstract = {{QuestionsThe exceptional occurrence of tall rain forest patches on foggy
   coastal mountaintops, surrounded by extensive xerophytic shrublands,
   suggests an important role of plant-plant interactions in the origin and
   persistence of these patches in semi-arid Chile. We asked whether
   facilitation by shrubs can explain the growth and survival of rain
   forest tree species, and whether shrub effects depend on the identity of
   the shrub species itself, the drought tolerance of the tree species and
   the position of shrubs in regard to wind direction.
   LocationOpen area-shrubland-forest matrix, Fray Jorge Forest National
   Park, Chile.
   MethodsWe recorded survival after 12years of a similar to 3600 tree
   saplings plantation (originally similar to 30-cm tall individuals) of
   Aextoxicon punctatum, Myrceugenia correifolia and Drimys winteri placed
   outside forests, beneath the shrub Baccharis vernalis, and in open
   (shrub-free) areas. We assessed the effects of neighbouring shrubs and
   soil humidity on survival and growth along a gradient related to the
   direction of fog movement.
   ResultsB. vernalis had a clear facilitative effect on tree establishment
   and survival since, after similar to 12years, saplings only survived
   beneath the shrub canopy. Long-term survival strongly depended on tree
   species identity, drought tolerance and position along the soil moisture
   gradient, with higher survival of A. punctatum (>35\%) and M.
   correifolia (>14\%) at sites on wind- and fog-exposed shrubland areas.
   Sites occupied by the shrub Aristeguietia salvia were unsuitable for
   trees, presumably due to drier conditions than under B. vernalis.
   ConclusionsInteractions between shrubs and fog-dependent tree species in
   dry areas revealed a strong, long-lasting facilitation effect on planted
   tree's survival and growth. Shrubs acted as benefactors, providing sites
   suitable for tree growth. Sapling mortality in the shrubland interior
   was caused by lower soil moisture, the consequence of lower fog loads in
   the air and thus insufficient facilitation. While B. vernalis was a key
   ecosystem engineer (nurse) and intercepted fog water that dripped to
   trees planted underneath, drier sites with A. salvia were unsuitable for
   trees. Consequently, nurse effects related to water input are strongly
   site and species specific, with facilitation by shrubs providing a
   plausible explanation for the initiation of forest patches in this
   semi-arid landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is often seen as a remote, complex or `unobtrusive' topic
   by the general public - a topic about which many people acquire
   information mainly from media reporting. However, media landscapes are
   changing rapidly, particularly with the growth of the internet and
   social media. A number of new media organisations are challenging
   traditional media and have gained significant audiences for their
   environment content. We analyse the coverage by three of these -
   Huffington Post, Vice and BuzzFeed - of the COP21 summit in Paris at the
   end of 2015, and compare it with that of traditional media. We show that
   while the general spectrum of themes is similar across media outlets,
   there are differences in the volume of the coverage and in the emphasis
   that is laid on different themes by some, but not all, of the new
   players compared to traditional media.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Narcissus papyraceus is a style dimorphic species with two floral forms,
   with anthers at similar height and stigmas above (long-styled L) and
   below (short-styled S) the anther level. The species is
   self-incompatible, but intra- and inter-morph compatible. Populations
   are either dimorphic (including both morphs) in the region of the Strait
   of Gibraltar, or L-monomorphic (with only L plants) in the inland of the
   Iberian Peninsula. This variation correlates with the most common floral
   visitors, being primarily long-tongued and short-tongued pollinators,
   respectively, a rare condition in Mediterranean plants. The maintenance
   of S-flowers relies on long-tongued insects, as only those deliver
   pollen to short-styled stigmas. Narcissus flowers present a long and
   narrow tube, at the bottom of which nectar accumulates, and a floral
   corona, which has been proposed as an important trait for the attraction
   of pollinators. Here we tested the importance of the corona on
   pollination of L and S flowers. We described UV reflectance patterns of
   the corona and tepals, and characterised VOCs in intact flowers and
   flowers with trimmed coronas. We also conducted a field experiment in
   the dimorphic and monomorphic region to estimate the importance of
   corona removal on seed production in stands with solitary plants and in
   groups to control for compatible pollen limitation. Reflectance was
   higher in the tepals than the corona, although both traits presented a
   reflectance peak around 450nm wavelength. L- and S-flowers produced
   similar volatiles, regardless of the manipulation of the corona. Across
   dimorphic and monomorphic regions, S-flowers with the corona removed
   suffered a reduction in seed production of ca. 50\%, while seed
   production remained similar in L flowers both with the corona intact and
   removed. Plants in solitary stands suffered a strong reduction in seed
   production, which was more pronounced in the monomorphic region. Our
   results suggest that the corona in Narcissus is more important for the
   pollination of S-flowers, which generally have lower seed production
   compared to L-flowers. Taken together, these results suggest that the
   floral corona indirectly plays an important role for maintenance of the
   polymorphism.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{107-118}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Defective hybrid seed development in angiosperms
   might mediate the rapid establishment of intrinsic post-zygotic
   isolation between closely related species. Extensive crosses within and
   among three lineages of wild tomatoes (Solanum section Lycopersicon)
   were performed to address the incidence, developmental timing and
   histological manifestations of hybrid seed failure. These lineages
   encompass different, yet fairly recent, divergence times and both
   allopatric and partially sympatric pairs.
   Methods Mature seeds were scored visually 2 months after hand
   pollinations, and viable-looking seeds were assessed for germination
   success. Using histological sections from early-developing seeds from a
   sub-set of crosses, the growth of three major seed compartments
   (endosperm, embryo and seed coat) was measured at critical developmental
   stages up to 21 d after pollination, with a focus on the timing and
   histological manifestations of endosperm misdevelopment in abortive
   hybrid seeds.
   Key Results For two of three interspecific combinations including the
   most closely related pair that was also studied histologically, almost
   all mature seeds appeared ` flat' and proved inviable; histological
   analyses revealed impaired endosperm proliferation at early globular
   embryo stages, concomitant with embryo arrest and seed abortion in both
   cross directions. The third interspecific combination yielded a mixture
   of flat, inviable and plump, viable seeds; many of the latter germinated
   and exhibited near-normal juvenile phenotypes or, in some instances,
   hybrid necrosis and impaired growth.
   Conclusions The overall results suggest that near-complete hybrid seed
   failure can evolve fairly rapidly and without apparent divergence in
   reproductive phenology/biology. While the evidence accrued here is
   largely circumstantial, early-acting disruptions of normal endosperm
   development are most probably the common cause of seed failure
   regardless of the type of endosperm (nuclear or cellular).}},

Title = {{Using Multitemporal Sentinel-1 C-band Backscatter to Monitor Phenology
   and Classify Deciduous and Coniferous Forests in Northern Switzerland}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Efficient methods to monitor forested areas help us to better understand
   their processes. To date, only a few studies have assessed the usability
   of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar ( SAR) datasets in this
   context. Here we present an analysis of an unprecedented set of C- band
   observations of mixed temperate forests. We demonstrate the potential of
   using multitemporal C- band VV and VH polarisation data for monitoring
   phenology and classifying forests in northern Switzerland. Each SAR
   acquisition was first radiometrically terrain corrected using digital
   elevation model- based image simulations of the local illuminated area.
   The flattened backscatter values and the local area values were input to
   a temporal compositing process integrating backscatter values from
   ascending and descending tracks. The process used local resolution
   weighting of each input, producing composite backscatter values that
   strongly mitigated terrain- induced distortions. Several descriptors
   were calculated to show the seasonal variation of European beech ( Fagus
   sylvatica), oak ( Quercus robur, Quercus petraea) and Norway spruce (
   Picea abies) in C- band data. Using their distinct seasonal signatures,
   the timing of leaf emergence and leaf fall of the deciduous species were
   estimated and compared to available ground observations. Furthermore,
   classifications for the forest types ` deciduous' and ` coniferous' and
   the investigated species were implemented using random forest
   classifiers. The deciduous species backscatter was about 1 dB higher
   than spruce throughout the year in both polarisations. The forest types
   showed opposing seasonal backscatter behaviours. At VH, deciduous
   species showed higher backscatter in winter than in summer, whereas
   spruce showed higher backscatter in summer than in winter. In VV, this
   pattern was similar for spruce, while no distinct seasonal behaviour was
   apparent for the deciduous species. The time differences between the
   estimations and the ground observations of the phenological events were
   approximately within the error margin ( similar to 12 days) of the
   temporal resolution. The classification performances were promising,
   with higher accuracies achieved for the forest types ( OA of 86\% and k
   = 0.73) than for individual species ( OA of 72\% and k = 0.58). These
   results show that multitemporal C- band backscatter data have
   significant potential to supplement optical remote sensing data for
   ecological studies and mapping of mixed temperate forests.}},

Abstract = {{Humans require multiple services from ecosystems, but it is largely
   unknown whether trade-offs between ecosystem functions prevent the
   realisation of high ecosystem multifunctionality across spatial scales.
   Here, we combined a comprehensive dataset (28 ecosystem functions
   measured on 209 forest plots) with a forest inventory dataset (105,316
   plots) to extrapolate and map relationships between various ecosystem
   multifunctionality measures across Europe. These multifunctionality
   measures reflected different management objectives, related to timber
   production, climate regulation and biodiversity conservation/recreation.
   We found that trade-offs among them were rare across Europe, at both
   local and continental scales. This suggests a high potential for
   win-win' forest management strategies, where overall multifunctionality
   is maximised. However, across sites, multifunctionality was on average
   45.8-49.8\% below maximum levels and not necessarily highest in
   protected areas. Therefore, using one of the most comprehensive
   assessments so far, our study suggests a high but largely unrealised
   potential for management to promote multifunctional forests.}},

Abstract = {{How do people perceive landscapes? What elements of the landscape do
   they identify as characteristic of a landscape? And how can we arrive at
   descriptions, and ultimately representations that better reflect
   people's notions of landscapes? In this study, we collected landscape
   descriptions from five landscape types at 10 study sites in Switzerland.
   For each site, we collected data from three sources: free lists with
   participants, hiking blogs, and Flickr tags. Free lists were obtained
   through on-site interviews with visitors, hiking blogs were gathered by
   focused crawling of web content, and Flickr tags were selected based on
   spatial footprints obtained from the hiking blogs. We quantitatively
   compared landscape descriptions between data sources and landscape types
   using cosine similarity. We found that descriptions from the same data
   source were significantly more similar, irrespective of landscape type.
   Descriptions from the same landscape type were more similar, but only
   within the same data source. Through a qualitative analysis of different
   aspects of landscape in our content, we found that each data source
   offered a different distribution of landscape aspects. For example,
   while Flickr tags contained high proportions of toponyms, they contained
   little content relating to sense of place. In contrast, hiking blogs
   contained more information about sense of place. Our approach combining
   these varied textual sources thus offers a more holistic view on
   landscapes. This study constitutes a step toward extracting semantically
   rich descriptions of landscapes from a variety of sources and using this
   information to distinguish different landscapes, with potential
   applications for landscape monitoring and management.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable progress has been made in ecological and evolutionary
   genetics with studies demonstrating how genes underlying plant and
   microbial traits can influence adaptation and even `extend' to influence
   community structure and ecosystem level processes. Progress in this area
   is limited to model systems with deep genetic and genomic resources that
   often have negligible ecological impact or interest. Thus, important
   linkages between genetic adaptations and their consequences at
   organismal and ecological scales are often lacking. Here we introduce
   the Sphagnome Project, which incorporates genomics into a long-running
   history of Sphagnum research that has documented unparalleled
   contributions to peatland ecology, carbon sequestration,
   biogeochemistry, microbiome research, niche construction, and ecosystem
   engineering. The Sphagnome Project encompasses a genus-level sequencing
   effort that represents a new type of model system driven not only by
   genetic tractability, but by ecologically relevant questions and
   hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{Global environmental change and biodiversity loss are closely linked
   through different feedback mechanisms. The University of Zurich Research
   Priority Programme on `Global Change and Biodiversity' approach is to
   work with interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity to integrate
   mechanisms of interactions, feedback and scale and improve our
   understanding of the feedbacks between global change and biodiversity
   effects. Such work across research disciplines is not without its
   challenges. Here we share some of the questions that arose from our
   research approach over the last five years and how we addressed these
   challenges. First, our transdisciplinary approach allows combining
   different disciplines into a more holistic perspective towards
   integrative research, but demands collaborative work to establish common
   terminology, concepts, and metrics. Second, the research theme's common
   perspective (biodiversity is desirable, global change is not) may also
   induce a confirmation bias from preconceived ideas. Third, new
   challenges emerge from scaling mechanisms and feedbacks at different
   spatial and temporal scales. Fourth, we investigate how to relate
   biodiversity, global change, ecosystem services and functions using
   interdisciplinary approaches. Fifth, we identify gaps between existing
   experiments and data requirements, and propose the definition of new
   experimental setups by linking processes and performing experiments at
   typical experimental scales as well as at larger scales. We conclude by
   emphasising the necessity to integrate theory, experiments, modelling
   and simulation, high performance computing and big data to understand
   feedbacks between biodiversity loss and processes of global change.}},

Title = {{Ontology and integrative research on Global Environmental Change:
   towards a critical GEC science}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{131-137}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses `integration' at the level of ontology to reflect
   on the conception and conduct of integrative research in Global
   Environmental Change (GEC) science. First, it outlines how the Earth
   system has become the dominant conceptual framework within which to
   approach GEC, marginalizing other ways of understanding the world. The
   paper argues that in order to grasp GEC and develop more effective
   responses to it, it is necessary to move beyond the singular ontology
   offered by the Earth system and engage with plural ontologies. Second,
   the paper highlights that scientific knowledge is inherently situated
   within networks of social and institutional power and oriented towards
   various social ends, and that as a consequences GEC science needs to
   reflect more deeply on the politics of its own knowledge production and
   its relationship to the policy sphere. In conclusion the paper calls for
   a more critical GEC science that builds these reflections into its
   scientific practices, and provides some leading questions that
   integrative research initiatives can use to guide self-reflexive
   research practices.}},

Title = {{Toward a methodical framework for comprehensively assessing forest

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{10652-10674}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) research has extended its scope
   from communities that are short-lived or reshape their structure
   annually to structurally complex forest ecosystems. The establishment of
   tree diversity experiments poses specific methodological challenges for
   assessing the multiple functions provided by forest ecosystems. In
   particular, methodological inconsistencies and nonstandardized protocols
   impede the analysis of multifunctionality within, and comparability
   across the increasing number of tree diversity experiments. By providing
   an overview on key methods currently applied in one of the largest
   forest biodiversity experiments, we show how methods differing in scale
   and simplicity can be combined to retrieve consistent data allowing
   novel insights into forest ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, we
   discuss and develop recommendations for the integration and
   transferability of diverse methodical approaches to present and future
   forest biodiversity experiments. We identified four principles that
   should guide basic decisions concerning method selection for tree
   diversity experiments and forest BEF research: (1) method selection
   should be directed toward maximizing data density to increase the number
   of measured variables in each plot. (2) Methods should cover all
   relevant scales of the experiment to consider scale dependencies of
   biodiversity effects. (3) The same variable should be evaluated with the
   same method across space and time for adequate larger-scale and
   longer-time data analysis and to reduce errors due to changing
   measurement protocols. (4) Standardized, practical and rapid methods for
   assessing biodiversity and ecosystem functions should be promoted to
   increase comparability among forest BEF experiments. We demonstrate that
   currently available methods provide us with a sophisticated toolbox to
   improve a synergistic understanding of forest multifunctionality.
   However, these methods require further adjustment to the specific
   requirements of structurally complex and long-lived forest ecosystems.
   By applying methods connecting relevant scales, trophic levels, and
   above- and belowground ecosystem compartments, knowledge gain from large
   tree diversity experiments can be optimized.}},

Title = {{What's (Not) on the Map: Landscape Features from Participatory Sketch
   Mapping Differ from Local Categories Used in Language}},
Journal = {{LAND}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Participatory mapping of local land use as the basis for planning and
   decision-making has become widespread around the globe. However, still
   relatively little is known about the conceptual underpinnings of
   geographic information produced through participatory mapping in given
   cultural and linguistic settings. In this paper, we therefore address
   the seemingly simple question of what is (not) represented on maps
   through an exploratory case study comparing land use categories
   participants represented on sketch maps with categories elicited through
   more language-focused ethnographic fieldwork. To explore landscape
   categorization, we conducted sketch mapping with 29 participants and
   in-depth ethnographic fieldwork with 19 participants from the Takana
   indigenous people in the Bolivian Amazon. Sketch mapping resulted in 74
   different feature types, while we elicited 156 landscape categories used
   in language, of which only 23 overlapped with feature types from the

Abstract = {{The French heartworm Angiostongylus vasorum is found in European red fox
   (Vulpes vulpes) and dog populations, where it appears to be spreading
   geographically. Once introduced into new areas, it establishes in local
   fox populations, typically to over 50\% prevalence in a few years. High
   susceptibility and constant excretion of first stage larvae (L1) by the
   definitive hosts are prerequisites for sustaining high parasite biomass
   in a particular habitat. The present study explores the hypothesis that
   repeated ingestion of gastropods in nature will result in accumulation
   of adult worms and elevated excretion of L1 in feces. Experimentally
   infected foxes were subsequently inoculated via stomach tube once (9
   weeks post initial inoculation) or twice (9 and 13 weeks post
   inoculation (wpi)) with 100 third stage A. vasorum larvae (L3)
   previously isolated from aquatic snails infected with L1 from a
   naturally infected dog. Despite large variation in fecal larval
   excretion for the individual animals within the groups, excretion of L1
   was significantly higher in foxes twice inoculated as compared to foxes
   inoculated only once. With an outlier in the once inoculated group
   removed, excretion became significantly higher in the three times
   inoculated group. Establishment of adult worms varied and only a trend
   to higher worm burdens was found in the group of foxes inoculated three
   times. However, this became significant with the same single outlier
   removed. Overall, it appears that protective immunity to A. vasorum does
   not appear to occur in V. vulpes with animals exhibiting high infection
   intensities without obvious clinical signs. The increasing larval
   excretion in foxes being repeatedly exposed to A. vasorum L3 support the
   hypothesis that foxes under natural conditions may repeatedly ingest
   infected gastropods and remain a source of environmental contamination
   for several months, potentially contributing to the establishment of
   endemic foci through increasing L1 excretion. (C) 2017 Published by

Abstract = {{Fusarium head blight, caused by fungi from the genus Fusarium, is one of
   the most harmful cereal diseases, resulting not only in severe yield
   losses but also in mycotoxin contaminated and health-threatening grains.
   Fusarium head blight is caused by a diverse set of species that have
   different host ranges, mycotoxin profiles and responses to agricultural
   practices. Thus, understanding the composition of Fusarium communities
   in the field is crucial for estimating their impact and also for the
   development of effective control measures. Up to now, most molecular
   tools that monitor Fusarium communities on plants are limited to certain
   species and do not distinguish other plant associated fungi. To close
   these gaps, we developed a sequencing-based community profiling
   methodology for crop-associated fungi with a focus on the genus
   Fusarium. By analyzing a 1600 bp long amplicon spanning the highly
   variable segments ITS and D1-D3 of the ribosomal operon by PacBio SMRT
   sequencing, we were able to robustly quantify Fusarium down to species
   level through clustering against reference sequences. The newly
   developed methodology was successfully validated in mock communities and
   provided similar results as the culture-based assessment of Fusarium
   communities by seed health tests in grain samples from different crop
   species. Finally, we exemplified the newly developed methodology in a
   field experiment with a wheatmaize crop sequence under different cover
   crop and tillage regimes. We analyzed wheat straw residues, cover crop
   shoots and maize grains and we could reveal that the cover crop hairy
   vetch (Vicia villosa) acts as a potent alternative host for Fusarium
   (OTU F.ave/tri) showing an eightfold higher relative abundance compared
   with other cover crop treatments. Moreover, as the newly developed
   methodology also allows to trace other crop-associated fungi, we found
   that vetch and green fallow hosted further fungal plant pathogens
   including Zymoseptoria tritici. Thus, besides their beneficial traits,
   cover crops can also entail phytopathological risks by acting as
   alternative hosts for Fusarium and other noxious plant pathogens. The
   newly developed sequencing based methodology is a powerful diagnostic
   tool to trace Fusarium in combination with other fungi associated to
   different crop species.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection imposed by mating preferences is often implicated in
   the evolution of both sexual dimorphism and divergence between species
   in signalling traits. Epicuticular compounds (ECs) are important
   signalling traits in insects and show extensive variability among and
   within taxa. Here, we investigate whether variation in the multivariate
   EC profiles of two sex role-reversed beetle species, Megabruchidius
   dorsalis and Megabruchidius tonkineus, predicts mate attractiveness and
   mating success in males and females. The two species had highly distinct
   EC profiles and both showed significant sexual dimorphism in ECs. Age
   and mating status in both species were also distinguishable by EC
   profile. Males and females of both species showed significant
   association between their EC profile and attractiveness, measured both
   as latency to mating and as success in mate-choice trials. Remarkably,
   the major multivariate vector describing attractiveness was correlated
   in both species, both sexes, and in both choice and no-choice
   experiments such that increased attractiveness was in all cases
   associated with a similar multivariate modification of EC composition.
   Furthermore, in both sexes this vector of attractiveness was associated
   with more male-like EC profiles, as well as those characterizing younger
   and nonvirgin individuals, which might reflect a general preference for
   individuals of high condition in both sexes. Despite significant sexual
   selection on EC composition, however, we found no support for the
   proposition that sexual selection is responsible for divergence in ECs
   between these species.}},

Abstract = {{Plant diversity influences many ecosystem functions including root
   decomposition. However, due to the presence of multiple pathways via
   which plant diversity may affect root decomposition, our mechanistic
   understanding of their relationships is limited. In a grassland
   biodiversity experiment, we simultaneously assessed the effects of three
   pathways-root litter quality, soil biota, and soil abiotic conditions-on
   the relationships between plant diversity (in terms of species richness
   and the presence/absence of grasses and legumes) and root decomposition
   using structural equation modeling. Our final structural equation model
   explained 70\% of the variation in root mass loss. However, different
   measures of plant diversity included in our model operated via different
   pathways to alter root mass loss. Plant species richness had a negative
   effect on root mass loss. This was partially due to increased Oribatida
   abundance, but was weakened by enhanced root potassium (K) concentration
   in more diverse mixtures. Equally, grass presence negatively affected
   root mass loss. This effect of grasses was mostly mediated via increased
   root lignin concentration and supported via increased Oribatida
   abundance and decreased root K concentration. In contrast, legume
   presence showed a net positive effect on root mass loss via decreased
   root lignin concentration and increased root magnesium concentration,
   both of which led to enhanced root mass loss. Overall, the different
   measures of plant diversity had contrasting effects on root
   decomposition. Furthermore, we found that root chemistry and soil biota
   but not root morphology or soil abiotic conditions mediated these
   effects of plant diversity on root decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Mounting theoretical evidence suggests that demographic stochasticity,
   environmental heterogeneity and biased movement of organisms
   individually affect the dynamics of biological invasions and range
   expansions. Studies of species spread in heterogeneous landscapes have
   traditionally characterized invasion velocities as functions of the mean
   resource density throughout the landscape, thus neglecting higher-order
   moments of the spatial resource distribution. Here, we show
   theoretically that different spatial arrangements of resources lead to
   different spread velocities even if the mean resource density throughout
   the landscape is kept constant. Specifically, we find that increasing
   the resource autocorrelation length causes a reduction in the speed of
   species spread. The model shows that demographic stochasticity plays a
   key role in the slowdown, which is strengthened when individuals can
   actively move towards resources. We then experimentally corroborated the
   theoretically predicted reduction in propagation speed in microcosm
   experiments with the protist Euglena gracilis by comparing spread in
   landscapes with different resource autocorrelation lengths. Our work
   identifies the resource autocorrelation length as a key modulator and a
   simple measure of landscape susceptibility to biological invasions,
   which needs to be considered for predicting invasion dynamics within
   naturally heterogeneous environmental corridors.}},

Title = {{Fusion of Multi-Source Satellite Data and DEMs to Create a New Glacier
   Inventory for Novaya Zemlya}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring glacier changes in remote Arctic regions are strongly
   facilitated by satellite data. This is especially true for the Russian
   Arctic where recently increased optical and SAR satellite imagery
   (Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel 1/2) and digital elevation models (TanDEM-X,
   ArcticDEM) are becoming available. These datasets offer new
   possibilities to create high-quality glacier inventories. Here, we
   present a new glacier inventory derived from a fusion of multi-source
   satellite data for Novaya Zemlya in the Russian Arctic. We mainly used
   Landsat 8 OLI data to automatically map glaciers with the band ratio
   method. Missing debris-covered glacier parts and misclassified lakes
   were manually corrected. Whereas perennial snow fields were a major
   obstacle in glacier identification, seasonal snow was identified and
   removed using Landsat 5 TM scenes from the year 1998. Drainage basins
   were derived semi-automatically using the ArcticDEM (gap-filled by the
   ASTER GDEM V2) and manually corrected using fringes from ALOS PALSAR.
   The new glacier inventory gives a glacierized area of 22,379 +/- 246.2
   km(2) with 1474 glacier entities >0.05 km(2). The region is dominated by
   large glaciers, as 909 glaciers <0.5 km(2) (62\% by number) cover only
   156 +/- 1.7 km(2) or 0.7\% of the area, whereas 49 glaciers >100 km(2)
   (3.3\% by number) cover 18,724 +/- 205.9 km(2) or 84\%. In total, 41
   glaciers are marine terminating covering an area of 16,063.7 +/- 118.8
   km(2). The mean elevation is 596 m for all glaciers in the study region
   (528 m in the northern part, 641 in the southern part). South-east
   (north-west) facing glaciers cover >35\% (20\%) of the area. For the
   smaller glaciers in the southern part we calculated an area loss of
   3.4\% (-52.5 +/- 3.1 km(2)) from 2001 to 2016.}},

Abstract = {{Massive outmigration from the Hill Region of Nepal has various
   implications for the older people left behind. This article assesses
   their situation and the challenges they face. To capture older people's
   experiences and views on the effects of outmigration on their living
   conditions, I applied a livelihoods perspective. This study, based on
   in-depth qualitative interviews and group discussions carried out in 3
   mountain villages, found that outmigration has had a profound effect on
   local economic and social conditions. Economic effects have included
   reduction and in some cases abandonment of agricultural land due to lack
   of labor. Socially, the elderly have experienced disrespect and neglect
   from the young, and they lament the demise of traditional Nepalese norms
   and values in society and in the family. Outmigration in combination
   with shifting demographics has created entirely new life situations for
   the elderly and has made their lives more difficult. This article
   contributes to an underresearched topic relevant to the mountain regions
   of the global South and draws attention to a social group that has
   frequently been overlooked in both development and migration research.}},

Title = {{Efficient preparation of Arabidopsis pollen tubes for ultrastructural
   analysis using chemical and cryo-fixation}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: The pollen tube (PT) serves as a model system for
   investigating plant cell growth and morphogenesis. Ultrastructural
   studies are indispensable to complement data from physiological and
   genetic analyses, yet an effective method is lacking for PTs of the
   model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
   Methods: Here, we present reliable approaches for ultrastructural
   studies of Arabidopsis PTs, as well as an efficient technique for
   immunogold detection of cell wall epitopes. Using different fixation and
   embedding strategies, we show the amount of PT ultrastructural details
   that can be obtained by the different methods.
   Results: Dozens of cross-sections can be obtained simultaneously by the
   approach, which facilitates and shortens the time for evaluation. In
   addition to in vitro-grown PTs, our study follows the route of PTs from
   germination, growth along the pistil, to the penetration of the dense
   stylar tissue, which requires considerable mechanical forces. To this
   end, PTs have different strategies from growing between cells but also
   between the protoplast and the cell wall and even within each other,
   where they share a partly common cell wall. The separation of PT cell
   walls in an outer and an inner layer reported for many plant species is
   less clear in Arabidopsis PTs, where these cell wall substructures are
   connected by a distinct transition zone.
   Conclusions: The major advancement of this method is the effective
   production of a large number of longitudinal and cross-sections that
   permits obtaining a detailed and representative picture of pollen tube
   structures in an unprecedented way. This is particularly important when
   comparing PTs of wild type and mutants to identify even subtle
   alterations in cytoarchitecture. Arabidopsis is an excellent plant for
   genetic manipulation, yet the PTs, several-times smaller compared to
   tobacco or lily, represent a technical challenge. This study reveals a
   method to overcome this problem and make Arabidopsis PTs more amenable
   to a combination of genetic and ultrastructural analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Based on morphological characters the monogeneric family Eupomatiaceae
   has been traditionally included in Magnoliales, closely related to
   Magnoliaceae, Himantandraceae or Annonaceae. This is well supported by
   molecular phylogenetic studies, and Eupomatiaceae appear strongly
   supported as sister to Annonaceae. Some specific characters of
   reproductive organs of Eupomatia have been regarded as autapomorphies of
   Eupomatiaceae. In earlier studies of Eupomatia fruits, the endocarp has
   been described as undifferentiated. Current research revealed the
   following notable characters of Eupomatiaceae: a difference in fruit
   wall structure of peripheral and inner fruiting carpels by congenital
   fusion of the peripheral carpels with the receptacle (epicarp) from
   early differentiation of mesocarp, and late growth of endocarp cells in
   a radial direction resulting in a parenchymatous palisade endocarp
   shortly before fruit maturation. This study also demonstrates that
   pericarp development and structure in mature fruits of Eupomatia differ
   conspicuously from other families of Magnoliales and are more similar to
   those of some Laurales. This is in addition to the cup-shaped receptacle
   and inferior ovary (fruit) found in several Laurales, but not other
   Magnoliales, which could be the result of convergence. The unexpected
   presence of a palisade endocarp could be a symplesiomorphy of the sister
   orders Magnoliales and Laurales or a synapomorphy of some Magnoliales
   and some Laurales.}},

Title = {{Wild dwarf mongooses produce general alert and predator-specific alarm
   calls}},

Abstract = {{Dwarf mongooses, the smallest species in the mongoose family, produce a
   number of diverse alarm-call types, with several being general and 2
   indicating predator type. Furthermore, the specificity of their
   alarm-call types appears higher for aerial than terrestrial threats and,
   unlike other mongoose species, they seem to use the same alarm-call type
   for both physically present terrestrial predators and secondary cues of
   their presence. Many species produce alarm calls in response to predator
   threats. Whilst these can be general alert calls, some are
   urgency-based, indicating perceived threat level, some are
   predator-specific, indicating the predator type present, and some encode
   information about both urgency level and predator type.
   Predator-specific calls given to a narrow range of stimuli and which
   elicit a specific, adaptive, response from the receiver are termed
   functionally referential. Differing escape strategies, habitat
   structural complexity and sociality may favor the evolution of
   functionally referential calls. A study of one captive group of dwarf
   mongooses (Helogale parvula) suggested their alarm calls could transmit
   information about species, distance, and elevation of predators. Using
   recordings of natural predator encounters, predator presentations and
   audio playbacks, we investigated the alarm-call system in 7 wild dwarf
   mongoose groups. We recorded 11 different alarm-call types given to 9
   stimulus categories. Of the 5 commonly emitted alarm-call types, 3
   appeared to be non-specific and 2 predator-specific, given to aerial and
   terrestrial predators respectively. The remaining 6 call types were
   rarely produced. Furthermore, aerial alarms were given to a narrower
   range of stimuli than their terrestrial alarm calls, which were given to
   both visible terrestrial predators and secondary cues of predators.
   Unlike other mongoose species, dwarf mongoose seem to use the same
   alarm-call type for both physically present terrestrial predators and
   secondary cues of their presence. We argue that detailed knowledge of
   species' alarm-call systems under natural conditions can shed light on
   the evolutionary emergence of different types of alarm calls.}},

Title = {{Experience buffers extrinsic mortality in a group-living bird species}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},

Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Extrinsic mortality has a strong impact on the evolution of
   life-histories, prey morphology and behavioural adaptations, but for
   many animals the causes of mortality are poorly understood. Predation is
   an important driver of extrinsic mortality and mobile animals form
   groups in response to increased predation risk. Furthermore, in many
   species juveniles suffer higher mortality than older individuals, which
   may reflect a lower phenotypic quality, lower competitiveness, or a lack
   of antipredator or foraging skills. Here we assessed the causes of
   mortality for 371 radio tagged Siberian jays. This sedentary bird
   species lives in family groups that contain a breeding pair as well as
   related and unrelated non-breeders. Ninety-five percent of death were
   due to predation (n = 59 out of 62 individuals) and most individuals
   were killed by Accipiter hawks. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards
   models showed that non-breeders had a lower survival than breeders, but
   only in territories in managed forest with little visual cover.
   Examining breeders, only sex influenced survival with males having a
   lower survival than females. For non-breeders, juveniles had lower
   survival than older non-breeders, and those on managed territories had
   lower survival than those on unmanaged territories. Additionally, a low
   feather quality reduced the survival probability of non-breeders only.
   Thus, living on managed territories and having a low feature quality
   affected only non-breeders, particularly juveniles. These findings add
   to previous research demonstrating that juvenile Siberian jays acquire
   critical antipredator skills from experienced group members. Thus,
   experience can buffer extrinsic mortality, highlighting that group
   living not only provides safety in numbers, but also provide social
   opportunities to learn critical life-skills.}},

Title = {{Giant tortoise habitats under increasing drought conditions on Aldabra
   Atoll-Ecological indicators to monitor rainfall anomalies and related
   vegetation activity}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{354-362}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Aldabra Atoll has the largest population of giant tortoises
   (Aldabrachelys gigantea) in the world. As such an important biological
   resource, it is necessary to understand how the effects of climate
   change will impact this keystone species; in particular the frequency of
   drought, which is likely to affect tortoise habitat. To assess whether
   drought frequency has changed over the last 50 years on Aldabra, we
   calculated the standardized precipitation index (SPI) to identify
   drought periods using monthly rainfall data collected during 1969-2013.
   We found that drought frequency has increased to more than six drought
   months per year today compared with about two months per year in the
   1970s (t = 2.884, p = 0.006). We used MODIS normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation activity, to determine
   how vegetation has responded to the changing drought frequency between
   2000 and 2013. We found that Aldabra's vegetation is highly responsive
   to changes in rainfall: anomalies in long-term mean monthly NDVI across
   Aldabra were found to decrease below the mean during most drought
   periods and increase above the mean during most non-drought periods. To
   investigate the response of tortoise habitat to rainfall, we extracted
   mean NDVI anomalies for three key habitat types. Open mixed scrub and
   grasslands, the preferred habitat of tortoises, showed the greatest
   decrease in vegetation activity during drought periods, and the greatest
   increase in average greenness during non-drought periods. Recent
   analysis has shown vegetation changes on Aldabra in recent decades. If
   these changes are caused by decreased precipitation, then the increased
   frequency of drought could impact the tortoise population, in both the
   short and long term, by limiting the quality and quantity of forage
   and/or shade availability within favoured habitats, and by changing the
   habitat composition across the atoll.}},

Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Inbreeding depression refers to the reduction of fitness that results
   from matings between relatives. Evidence for reduced fitness in inbred
   individuals is widespread, but the strength of inbreeding depression
   varies widely both within and among taxa. Environmental conditions can
   mediate this variation in the strength of inbreeding depression, with
   environmental stress exacerbating the negative consequences of
   inbreeding. Parents can modify the environment experienced by offspring,
   and have thus the potential to mitigate the negative consequences of
   inbreeding. While such parental effects have recently been demonstrated
   during the postnatal period, the role of prenatal parental effects in
   influencing the expression of inbreeding depression remains unexplored.
   To address this gap, we performed matings between full-sibs or unrelated
   individuals in replicated lines of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)
   experimentally selected for high and low maternal egg provisioning. We
   show that in the low maternal investment lines hatching success was
   strongly reduced when parents were related. In the high maternal
   investment lines, however, this negative effect of inbreeding on
   hatching success was absent, demonstrating that prenatal maternal
   provisioning can alleviate the negative fitness consequences of
   inbreeding.}},

Title = {{Patient-centered boundary mechanisms to foster intercultural
   partnerships in health care: a case study in Guatemala}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Up to one half of the population in Africa, Asia and Latin
   America has little access to high-quality biomedical services and relies
   on traditional health systems. Medical pluralism is thus in many
   developing countries the rule rather than the exception, which is why
   the World Health Organization is calling for intercultural partnerships
   to improve health care in these regions. They are, however, challenging
   due to disparate knowledge systems and lack of trust that hamper
   understanding and collaboration. We developed a collaborative,
   patient-centered boundary mechanism to overcome these challenges and to
   foster intercultural partnerships in health care. To assess its impact
   on the quality of intercultural patient care in a medically pluralistic
   developing country, we conducted and evaluated a case study.
   Methods: The case study took place in Guatemala, since previous efforts
   to initiate intercultural medical partnerships in this country were
   hampered by intense historical and societal conflicts. It was designed
   by a team from ETH Zurich's Transdisciplinarity Lab, the National Cancer
   Institute of Guatemala, two traditional Councils of Elders and 25 Mayan
   healers from the Kaqchikel and Q'eqchi' linguistic groups. It was
   implemented from January 2014 to July 2015. Scientists and traditional
   political authorities collaborated to facilitate workshops, comparative
   diagnoses and patient referrals, which were conducted jointly by
   biomedical and traditional practitioners. The traditional medical
   practices were thoroughly documented, as were the health-seeking
   pathways of patients, and the overall impact was evaluated.
   Results: The boundary mechanism was successful in discerning barriers of
   access for indigenous patients in the biomedical health system, and in
   building trust between doctors and healers. Learning outcomes included a
   reduction of stereotypical attitudes towards traditional healers,
   improved biomedical procedures due to enhanced self-reflection of
   doctors, and improved traditional health care due to refined diagnoses
   and adapted treatment strategies. In individual cases, the beneficial
   effects of traditional treatments were remarkable, and the doctors
   continued to collaborate with healers after the study was completed.
   Comparison of the two linguistic groups illustrated that the outcomes
   are highly context-dependent.
   Conclusions: If well adapted to local context, patient-centered boundary
   mechanisms can enable intercultural partnerships by creating access,
   building trust and fostering mutual learning, even in circumstances as
   complex as those in Guatemala. Creating multilateral patient-centered
   boundary mechanisms is thus a promising approach to improve health care
   in medically pluralistic developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{In view of the clinical importance of hypofractionated radiotherapy,
   track models which are based on multi-hit events are currently
   reinvestigated. These models are often criticized, because it is
   believed that the probability of multi-track hits is negligible. In this
   work, the probabilities for one- and multi-track events are determined
   for different biological targets. The obtained probabilities can be used
   with nano-dosimetric cluster size distributions to obtain the parameters
   of track models. We quantitatively determined the probabilities for one-
   and multi-track events for 100, 500 and 1000 keV electrons,
   respectively. It is assumed that the single tracks are statistically
   independent and follow a Poisson distribution. Three different
   biological targets were investigated: (1) a DNA strand (2 nm scale); (2)
   two adjacent chromatin fibers (60 nm); and (3) fiber loops (300 nm). It
   was shown that the probabilities for one- and multi-track events are
   increasing with energy, size of the sensitive target structure, and
   dose. For a 2 x 2 x 2 nm(3) target, one-track events are around 10,000
   times more frequent than multi-track events. If the size of the
   sensitive structure is increased to 100-300 nm, the probabilities for
   one- and multi-track events are of the same order of magnitude. It was
   shown that target theories can play a role for describing
   radiation-induced cell death if the targets are of the size of two
   adjacent chromatin fibers or fiber loops. The obtained probabilities can
   be used together with the nano-dosimetric cluster size distributions to
   determine model parameters for target theories.}},

Abstract = {{The first satellite-derived inventory of glaciers and rock glaciers in
   Chile, created from Landsat TM/ETM+ images spanning between 2000 and
   2003 using a semi-automated procedure, is presented in a single
   standardized format. Large glacierized areas in the Altiplano, Palena
   Province and the periphery of the Patagonian icefields are inventoried.
   The Chilean glacierized area is 23 708 +/- 1185 km(2), including similar
   to 3200 km(2) of both debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers. Glacier
   distribution varies as a result of climatic gradients with latitude and
   elevation, with 0.8\% occurring in the Desert Andes (17 degrees 30'-32
   degrees S); 3.6\% in the Central Andes (32-36 degrees S), 6.2\% in the
   Lakes District and Palena Province (36-46 degrees S), and 89.3\% in
   Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego (46-56 degrees S). Glacier outlines,
   across all glacierized regions and size classes, updated to 2015 using
   Landsat 8 images for 98 complexes indicate a decline in areal extent
   affecting mostly clean-ice glaciers (-92.3 +/- 4.6 km(2)), whereas
   debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers in the Desert and Central
   Andes appear nearly unchanged in their extent. Glacier attributes
   estimated from this new inventory provide valuable insights into spatial
   patterns of glacier shrinkage for assessing future glacier changes in
   response to climate change.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Understanding species coexistence and regulation of biodiversity are
   major research challenges, yet there is no consensus on the effects of
   diversity on diversity, including their mediation through plant-plant
   interactions.
   2. We examined how the diversity of recipient communities impacted on
   the establishment of colonising species. We ran a greenhouse-based
   community experiment, creating artificial arable crop communities with
   varying levels of barley genotype and weed species diversity, analysed
   with structural equation modelling of responses across trophic levels.
   3. Colonising arable weed species establishment was significantly
   reduced when the recipient communities' weed species richness, but not
   barley genotype richness, increased. Recipient plant communities with
   higher species richness occupied more total niche space and showed
   stronger competition with colonising species. In contrast, recipient
   plant communities with higher genotype richness, even though they had
   slightly greater niche space occupancy, had no significant effects on
   the colonisation of additional species.
   4. Responses were species specific: colonising common weed species
   establishment was less affected by the recipient plant communities than
   that of colonising rare weed species. Strong responses of colonising
   rare species were related to the abiotic rather than the biotic
   environment created by the recipient communities. The stronger response
   of colonising rare species suggests greater niche overlap with and
   competitive inferiority to the recipient plant community, whereas the
   relative independence of colonising common species indicates less niche
   overlap and/or competitive equality or superiority.
   5. We observed a negative species diversity effect on colonising
   species, with the effect size increasing with increasing rarity of the
   colonising species. This differential responsiveness of colonising rare
   and common arable weed species to the presence of and diversity in the
   recipient arable plant communities may be crucial in understanding
   rarity and may result from differential evolutionary pathways in
   response to interactions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Question: In plant communities, the presence of a species has
   consequences for other species, with some being competitively excluded
   while others benefit from the close vicinity of neighbours. Even though
   such specificity in plant interactions is common and known, there is no
   empirical assessment of the mechanisms that would help us understand its
   importance for plant diversity. Here we asked whether analysing spatial
   associations between plant traits known to affect the environment (i.e.
   effect traits) and those known to respond to the environment (i.e.
   response traits) might explain plant-plant interactions and their role
   in community assembly.
   Location: Sierra Nevada Mountains, Spain.
   Methods: In a field study, we addressed the specificity of plant-plant
   interactions by quantifying effect traits of three co-occurring
   cushion-forming species and response traits of their associated plant
   assemblages. Traits were measured at the individual level and then
   aggregated to trait metrics (mean, range, dispersion) at the plot level.
   Finally, plot-level metrics of effect traits were related to response
   traits and the species composition of plant communities.
   Results: Each cushion-forming species had a distinctive combination of
   effect traits and harboured a unique plant community with an exclusive
   composition of response traits. With multivariate statistics we showed
   that differences in effect traits (branch density and canopy height)
   among and within cushion species significantly explained response traits
   (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content) of associated species and
   the local-scale species composition.
   Conclusions: Using effect and response traits measured at the individual
   level, we provide a mechanistic understanding of the species specificity
   of plant interactions and demonstrate how important such specificity is
   for species diversity in an ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{In a context of scientific and public debates on permafrost degradation
   under global climate change, this article provides an integrated review
   and analysis of environmental and socio-economic trends in a subarctic
   region. It focuses on Sakha (Yakut) animal husbandry as an example of
   indigenous land use. Within Sakha-Yakutia's boreal forests, animal
   husbandry takes place in thermokarst depressions containing grassland
   areas (alaas) that formed in the early Holocene in a complex interplay
   of local geological conditions, climate changes, and permafrost
   dynamics. The current scale and speed of environmental change, along
   with shifting socio-economic processes, increasingly challenges Sakha's
   adaptive capacity in use of alaas areas. The paper synthesizes
   information on the evolution of permafrost landscapes and on the local
   inhabitants' and scientific knowledge. It also probes land-use prospects
   for the near future. The imminence of challenges for alaas ecosystems
   requires a holistic understanding between researchers and stakeholder
   communities, which in turn depends on a comprehensive assessment of the
   dynamic interaction of physical and social drivers of change. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{People in unfamiliar environments often need navigation guidance to
   reach a destination. Research has found that compared to outdoors,
   people tend to lose orientation much more easily within complex
   buildings, such as university buildings and hospitals. This paper
   proposes a category-based method to generate landmark-based route
   instructions to support people's wayfinding activities in unfamiliar
   indoor environments. Compared to other methods relying on detailed
   instance-level data about the visual, semantic, and structural
   characteristics of individual spatial objects, the proposed method
   relies on commonly available data about categories of spatial objects,
   which exist in most indoor spatial databases. With this, instructions
   like Turn right after the second door, and use the elevator to go to the
   second floor can be generated for indoor navigation. A case study with a
   university campus shows that the method is feasible in generating
   landmark-based route instructions for indoor navigation. More
   importantly, compared to metric-based instructions (i.e., the benchmark
   for indoor navigation), the generated landmark-based instructions can
   help users to unambiguously identify the correct decision point where a
   change of direction is needed, as well as offer information for the
   users to confirm that they are on the right way to the destination.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-soil interactions are recognized to play a crucial role in the
   ecosystem response to climate change. We developed a facility to
   disentangle the complex interactions behind the plant-soil C feedback
   mechanisms. The MICE (Multi-Isotope labelling in a Controlled
   Environment') facility consists of two climate chambers with independent
   control of the atmospheric conditions (light, CO2, temperature,
   humidity) and the soil environment (temperature, moisture). Each chamber
   holds 15 plant-soil systems with hermetical separation of the shared
   above ground (shoots) from the individual belowground compartments
   (roots, rhizosphere, soil). Stable isotopes (e.g. C-13, N-15, H-2, O-18)
   can be added to either compartment and traced within the whole system.
   The soil CO2 efflux rate is monitored, and plant material, leached soil
   water and gas samples are taken frequently. The facility is a powerful
   tool to improve our mechanistic understanding of plant-soil interactions
   that drive the C cycle feedback to climate change.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3745-3750}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Models suggest that the mechanism of competition can influence the
   growth advantage associated with being large (in absolute body size or
   relative to other individuals in the population). Large size is
   advantageous under interference, but disadvantageous under exploitative
   competition. We addressed this prediction in a laboratory experiment on
   Rana temporaria tadpoles competing for limited food. There were 166
   target individuals spanning a 10-fold range in body mass reared for
   3days with three other individuals that were either the same size, half
   as large, or twice as large as the target. Relative growth rate
   (proportion per day) declined with size, and absolute growth rate (mass
   per day) reached a peak at intermediate size and declined thereafter.
   Tadpoles grew slowly if they were large relative to their competitors,
   although relative body size was less important than absolute size. As a
   result, size variation declined in groups that were initially composed
   of individuals of variable size. Thus, bigger was not better under
   exploitative competition. Our results help connect individual-level
   behavior with individual growth and the size distribution of the

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{239-249}},

Abstract = {{Many bacteria communicate with each other through signalling molecules,
   a process known as cell-to-cell communication. During this process, it
   is important for the signalling molecules to: (1) reach the target
   cells; and (2) to be received by the cognate receptor. Barriers such as
   the presence of extracellular matrix may prevent signals from reaching
   their targets; however, the influence of the extracellular matrix on
   cell-to-cell communication has scarcely been studied. Here, we
   demonstrate that the overproduction of an extracellular matrix,
   alginate, in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa mucoid variant, alters
   cell-to-cell communication by interfering with the response to quinolone
   signals while having no effect on N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones. The
   inhibition of quinolone signalling by alginate is limited to the
   alginate overproducer and has no effect on neighbour cells that do not
   produce alginate. Our study indicates that alginate overproduction
   affects the cell-to-cell communication of the mucoid variant, which may
   results in different downstream behaviours when it emerges in the
   presence of the wild-type (WT).}},

Title = {{Development and evaluation of a specialized task taxonomy for spatial
   planning - A map literacy experiment with topographic maps}},
Journal = {{ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{16-26}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Topographic maps are among the most commonly used map types, however,
   their complex and information-rich designs depicting natural, human-made
   and cultural features make them difficult to read. Regardless of their
   complexity, spatial planners make extensive use of topographic maps in
   their work. On the other hand, various studies suggest that map literacy
   among the development planning professionals in South Africa is not very
   high. The widespread use of topographic maps combined with the low
   levels of map literacy presents challenges for effective development
   planning. In this paper we address some of these challenges by
   developing a specialized task taxonomy based on systematically assessed
   map literacy levels; and conducting an empirical experiment with
   topographic maps to evaluate our task taxonomy. In such empirical
   studies if non-realistic tasks are used, the results of map literacy
   tests may be skewed. Furthermore, experience and familiarity with the
   studied map type play a role in map literacy. There is thus a need to
   develop map literacy tests aimed at planners specifically. We developed
   a taxonomy of realistic map reading tasks typically executed during the
   planning process. The taxonomy defines six levels tasks of increasing
   difficulty and complexity, ranging from recognising symbols to
   extracting knowledge. We hypothesized that competence in the first four
   levels indicates functional map literacy. In this paper, we present
   results from an empirical experiment with 49 map literate participants
   solving a subset of tasks from the first four levels of the taxonomy
   with a topographic map. Our findings suggest that the proposed taxonomy
   is a good reference for evaluating topographic map literacy.
   Participants solved the tasks on all four levels as expected and we
   therefore conclude that the experiment based on the first four levels of
   the taxonomy successfully determined the functional map literacy of the
   participants. We plan to continue the study for the remaining levels,
   repeat the experiments with a group of map illiterate participants to
   confirm that the taxonomy can also be used to determine map illiteracy.

Title = {{Size-Mediated Interaction between a Cushion Species and Other Non-
   cushion Species at High Elevations of the Hengduan Mountains, SW China}},

Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Arenaria polytrichoides (Caryophyllaceae) is a common cushion plant
   occurring at high elevations in the Himalaya- Hengduan Mountains, SW
   China. It frequently has other non-cushion species growing within its
   canopy, forming a contrast with the surrounding areas because it creates
   patches of higher diversity and greater biomass. In this study, we
   examined the relationship between the cushions and associated noncushion
   species along a gradient of cushion size. A total of 200 A.
   polytrichoides individuals were selected to fit four size classes. Field
   measurements were carried out to assess canopy structure, functional
   traits relevant to growth and reproduction, and soil quality below
   cushions along the size gradient. Furthermore, the size effect of
   cushions on the richness and abundance of species and biomass production
   was also examined. All the morphological variables examined exhibited a
   positive correlation with cushion size, as did the nutrients under
   cushions. Large and compact cushions were associated with higher soil
   nutrient contents compared with small and loose cushions. As a result of
   these biogenic environmental changes, there was a stronger facilitation
   effect performed by large cushions. Data pertaining to functional traits
   revealed that large cushions benefit from the enhanced resources within
   their compact structure and exhibit greater fitness and a higher
   reproductive output than small cushions. Our data indicated that
   interactions occur between cushion species and other plants depending on
   the size of the cushions, probably because of the greater heterogeneity
   of conditions beneath larger cushions. These findings provide a clear
   demonstration of the generally overlooked importance of the traits of
   nurse plants, such as size and age, in terms of their facilitative
   effects.}},

Title = {{H3K23me1 is an evolutionarily conserved histone modification associated

Journal = {{PLANT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{293-303}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Amino-terminal tails of histones are targets for diverse
   post-translational modifications whose combinatorial action may
   constitute a code that will be read and interpreted by cellular proteins
   to define particular transcriptional states. Here, we describe
   monomethylation of histone H3 lysine 23 (H3K23me1) as a histone
   modification not previously described in plants. H3K23me1 is an
   evolutionarily conserved mark in diverse species of flowering plants.
   Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing in
   Arabidopsis thaliana showed that H3K23me1 was highly enriched in
   pericentromeric regions and depleted from chromosome arms. In
   transposable elements it co-localized with CG, CHG and CHH DNA
   methylation as well as with the heterochromatic histone mark H3K9me2.
   Transposable elements are often rich in H3K23me1 but different families
   vary in their enrichment: LTR-Gypsy elements are most enriched and
   RC/Helitron elements are least enriched. The histone methyltransferase
   KRYPTONITE and normal DNA methylation were required for normal levels of
   H3K23me1 on transposable elements. Immunostaining experiments confirmed
   the pericentromeric localization and also showed mild enrichment in less
   condensed regions. Accordingly, gene bodies of protein-coding genes had
   intermediate H3K23me1 levels, which coexisted with CG DNA methylation.
   Enrichment of H3K23me1 along gene bodies did not correlate with
   transcription levels. Together, this work establishes H3K23me1 as a so
   far undescribed component of the plant histone code.}},

Abstract = {{Archaeobotanical analyses of charred seeds, fruit and wood charcoal from
   the residential part of the ez-Zantur area at Petra, Jordan, provide new
   data on the agricultural economy and use of the landscape in this famous
   merchant Nabataean city from the middle of the 2nd century bc to the
   beginning of the 5th century ad. The study is based on analyses of 7,640
   whole and fragmented seeds, pips and fruit stones and 624 charcoal
   fragments sampled from household deposits. The results show that the
   food supply was based on common Mediterranean cultivated taxa such as
   cereals (Hordeum vulgare, Triticum aestivum/durum), pulses (Lens
   culinaris) and fruit (Olea europaea, Ficus carica, Vitis vinifera),
   which were probably cultivated both in the city and its hinterland. The
   by-products from the processing of cereals and fruit trees played a
   significant role in fuel supply, supplementing woody wild plants
   obtained from rocky slopes and the desert valley. The variety of fuel
   resources shows a major capacity to manage complex supply networks and
   perhaps the rarity of natural woodland cover. The existence of orchards
   within the city centre and notably olive groves is indicated in the
   Early Nabataean period (mid 2nd century to mid 1st century bc) but they
   expanded during the Classical Nabataean period (mid 1st century bc to
   1st century ad), probably reflecting specialised fruit growing. Unusual
   plant remains such as Prunus armeniaca (apricot), P. persica (peach) and
   Juglans regia (walnut) are considered to be social indicators of
   prosperity. These archaeobotanical results fit with others from this
   region and match with the urbanization and social dynamics of the city
   of Petra.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Non-native species often acquire novel interspecific interactions, which
   are central to several hypotheses of invasion success, including biotic
   resistance and invasional meltdown. However, the outcome of these
   interactions is not often linked with the demographic evidence based on
   the full life cycle of the species. The Philippine Ground Orchid
   (Spathoglottis plicata) has invaded Puerto Rico and has acquired both
   negative and positive interspecific interactions involving the native
   weevil Stethobaris polita and the invasive red fire ant Solenopsis
   invicta, respectively. We studied a population in the Rio Abajo Forest,
   and asked how these interactions affect population demography by using a
   combination of field, experimental and modelling approaches.
   Stage-structured matrix population models based on four years of field
   observations showed that the population of S. plicata is growing at a
   rate (lambda) of 1.05 under natural conditions. When we modified
   fecundity values based on experimental exclusion of weevils and ants,
   the control treatment showed a similar lambda. Excluding weevils
   increased lambda to 1.20, whereas the exclusion of ants decreased lambda
   to 1.03. When we incorporate demographic and environmental stochasticity
   in our models, exclusion of invasive red fire ants significantly reduces
   the orchid abundance over time. Although weevils offer some biotic
   resistance to S. plicata, these effects do not prevent orchid population
   growth and expansion. On the other hand, invasive red fire ants have a
   positive effect on the invasive orchid's lambda, partially supporting
   the invasional meltdown hypothesis. This study presents a method that
   allows one to combine opposing mechanisms of species interactions within
   the same quantitative framework, and the results highlight the
   importance of considering acquired plant-animal interactions and
   stochastic processes when evaluating the population growth rates and
   dynamics of invasive plants.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{In the Paris Agreement, it is stated that country's vulnerability to
   climate change is a key factor to decide where and how to allocate
   adaptation funds. However, the distribution of available funds continues
   to be a controversial point of discussion. To inform this discussion, we
   look at how policy makers could be differentiating regions for financing
   countries adaptation needs. We synthesize the results of global
   vulnerability assessments and conclude that in spite of some agreement
   between global vulnerability distribution and current funding allocation
   based on income groups, climate vulnerability remains a nuanced and
   problematic concept. In a search for increased transparency to inform
   adaptation financing, we analyze the new risk approach brought forward
   in recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. A
   main advantage of this new formulation is a clearer distinction between
   physical hazards and vulnerability, where vulnerability is solely driven
   by societal factors. Notwithstanding, the risk approach comes with some
   shortfalls, not least in terms of scale mismatches. This confirms that
   more efforts could be devoted in exploring appropriate scales (from both
   climatological and societal perspectives) and methodologies for
   embedding the vulnerability approach in a risk framework. However, a
   prevalent disconnect between science and policy on issues of adaptation
   financing has so far impeded the shift from earlier formulation of
   vulnerability to a risk concept in the policy arena. The IPCC has a
   pivotal role to play in filling this gap by leading a country-level
   assessment that can serve as a basis for prioritizing adaptation
   financing. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between taxa are essential drivers of ecological community
   structure and dynamics, but they are not taken into account by
   traditional indices of beta diversity. In this study, we propose a novel
   family of indices that quantify community similarity in the context of
   taxa interaction networks. Using publicly available datasets, we
   assessed the performance of two specific indices that are Taxa
   INteraction-Adjusted (TINA, based on taxa co-occurrence networks), and
   Phylogenetic INteraction-Adjusted (PINA, based on phylogenetic
   similarities). TINA and PINA outperformed traditional indices when
   partitioning human-associated microbial communities according to
   habitat, even for extremely downsampled datasets, and when organising
   ocean micro-eukaryotic plankton diversity according to geographical and
   physicochemical gradients. We argue that interaction-adjusted indices
   capture novel aspects of diversity outside the scope of traditional
   approaches, highlighting the biological significance of ecological
   association networks in the interpretation of community similarity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{53}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Reviewing the current state of knowledge about sequential extraction
   applied for soil vanadium (V) fractionation, we identified an urgent
   requirement of an sequential extraction (SE) specified for V. Namely,
   almost all previous SE extracted only 8.4\%-48\% of total V in soils
   (excluding residue). Thus, we proposed an eight-step SE for V
   fractionation in soils according to the knowledge gained from literature
   and our own dissolution experiments with model minerals. After
   extracting the mobilisable and adsorbed V with de-ionised water and 5
   mmol/L phosphate, 1 mol/L pyrophosphate was applied to gather organic
   matter bound V which minimised the artefact dissolving Al and Fe (hydr)
   oxides occurred when using HNO3-H2O2 for extraction. Extraction with 0.4
   mol/L NH2OH center dot HCl was highly selective toward manganese oxides.
   Fractionation of different crystalline Al and Fe (hydr) oxides
   associated V with 1 mol/L HCl, 0.2 mol/L oxalate buffer and 4 mol/LHCl
   at 95 degrees C especially improved the extractability ofV incorporated
   with crystalline phase associated V. The suitability of our new SE
   scheme was confirmed by its higher selectivity against the target phases
   and higher extraction efficiencies (55\%-77\% of total V) with
   modelminerals and 6 soils of different properties than previous SE. (C)

Abstract = {{Plant height is an important trait for plant reproductive success. Plant
   height is often under pollinator-mediated selection, and has been shown
   to be correlated with various other traits. However, few studies have
   examined the evolutionary trajectory of plant height under selection and
   the pleiotropic effects of plant height evolution. We conducted a
   bi-directional artificial selection experiment on plant height with fast
   cycling Brassica rapa plants to estimate its heritability and genetic
   correlations, and to reveal evolutionary responses to artificial
   selection on height and various correlated traits. With the divergent
   lines obtained through artificial selection, we subsequently conducted
   pollinator-choice assays and investigated resource limitation of fruit
   production. We found that plant height variation is strongly genetically
   controlled (with a realized heritability of 41-59\%). Thus, plant height
   can evolve rapidly under phenotypic selection. In addition, we found
   remarkable pleiotropic effects in phenology, morphology, floral scent,
   color, nectar and leaf glucosinolates. Most traits were increased in
   tall-line plants, but flower size, UV reflection and glucosinolates were
   decreased, indicating potential trade-offs. Pollinators preferred plants
   of the tall selection lines over the short selection lines in both
   greenhouse experiments with bumblebees and field experiment with natural
   pollinators. We did not detect any differences in resource limitation
   between plants of the different selection lines. Overall, our study
   predicts that increased height should evolve under positive
   pollinator-mediated directional selection with potential trade-offs in
   floral signals and herbivore defense.}},

Title = {{Invasive plants threaten the least mobile butterflies in Switzerland}},
Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aim Biological invasions are today the second-largest global threat for
   biodiversity. Once introduced, exotic plant species can modify ecosystem
   composition, structure and dynamics, eventually driving native species
   to local extinction. Among the groups of organisms, most likely to be
   directly affected by exotic invasive plants are herbivorous insects,
   such as butterflies, which strongly depend on plants throughout their
   life cycle. However, it remains unclear whether invasive plants have a
   negative or a positive effect on butterfly diversity at a landscape
   scale.
   Location Switzerland.
   Methods Using an extensive inventory (393 sites across Switzerland) of
   both butterfly and invasive plants, we explore the impact of 31 invasive
   black listed plant species on local butterfly richness. We further
   identify each butterfly species' response to invasive plants (i.e.
   positive, neutral or negative) and analyse the functional and
   phylogenetic characteristics of these different groups of species.
   Results Our results indicate that butterfly richness negatively
   correlates with an increase in invasive plant richness. When studying
   the individual response of each butterfly species to the number of
   invasive plants, we found that no single butterfly is profiting from
   invasive plant species, while 28 butterfly species (24\%) suffer from
   the presence of invasive plants. We further show that the species
   negatively affected are on average less mobile than the unaffected
   species and that they are phylogenetically clustered.
   Main conclusions Our results present evidences of the influence of
   invasive species on other trophic levels and interaction networks. We
   further highlight that a lack of management efforts for mitigating
   invasive plant impacts threatens specific sections of the functional and
   phylogenetic diversity of butterflies.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial heterogeneity of snow and firn properties on glaciers introduces
   uncertainty in interpretation of point and profile observations and
   complicates modelling of meltwater percolation and runoff. Here we
   present a study of the temporal and spatial dynamics of firn density and
   stratigraphy at the plot-scale (approximate to 10 m x 10 m x 10 m)
   repeated annually during 2012-14 at the Lomonosovfonna ice-field,
   Svalbard. Results from cores, video inspections in boreholes and radar
   grid surveys are compared. Ice layers 0.1-50 cm thick comprised
   approximate to 8\% of the borehole length. Most of them are 1-3 cm thick
   and could not be traced between boreholes separated by 3 m. Large
   lateral variability of firn structure affects representativeness of
   observations in single holes and calls for repeated studies in multiple
   points to derive a representative stratigraphy signal. Radar reflections
   are poorly correlated with ice layers in individual boreholes. However,
   the match between the high amplitude peaks in the grid-averaged radar
   signal and horizons of preferential ice layer formation revealed by
   averaging the video surveys over multiple boreholes is higher. These
   horizons are interpreted as buried firn layers previously exposed to
   melt-freeze or wind-driven densification and several of them are
   consistently recovered throughout three field campaigns.}},

Abstract = {{Surge-type glaciers have been observed in several mountain ranges of the
   world. Though Karakoram and Pamir are the hot spots for the occurrence
   of surge-type glaciers in High Mountain Asia, few surge-type glaciers
   also exist in Tien Shan. These have not been studied or reported in
   detail in the recent literature. We have identified 39 surge-type
   glaciers and five tributary surges in Tien Shan either from available
   literature or by visual interpretation using available images from the
   period 1960 until 2014. Out of the 39 glaciers, 9 are confirmed as
   surge-type, 13 are very probably surge-type, and the remaining are
   possibly of surge-type. Most of the surge-type glaciers are located in
   Ak-Shiirak and Central Tien Shan. Compared with the normal glaciers of
   Tien Shan, the surge-type glaciers are larger, cover higher ranges of
   elevations, and have shallower slopes. There is no significant
   difference in aspect. The largest surge events were observed in Central
   Tien Shan: North Inylchek Glacier (years 1996/1997) and Samoilowich
   Glacier (years 1992 until 2006) advanced several kilometers. The surge
   cycle was around 50 years for both of these glaciers. The advance was
   less pronounced for all other surge-type glaciers during the period ca.
   1960-2014. Some of the tributary glaciers behaved differently than the
   main glaciers in the sense that they continuously advanced during the
   entire period of our study, whereas the main glaciers have remained
   stable or retreated.}},

Abstract = {{Glacier observation data from major mountain regions of the world are
   key to improving our understanding of glacier changes: they deliver
   fundamental baseline information for climatological, hydrological, and
   hazard assessments. In many mountain ecosystems, as well as in the
   adjacent lowlands, glaciers play a crucial role in freshwater provision
   and regulation. This article first presents the state of the art on
   glacier monitoring and related strategies within the framework of the
   Global Terrestrial Network for Glaciers (GTN-G). Both in situ
   measurements of changes in glacier mass, volume, and length as well as
   remotely sensed data on glacier extents and changes over entire mountain
   ranges provide clear indications of climate change. Based on experiences
   from capacity-building activities undertaken in the Tropical Andes and
   Central Asia over the past years, we also review the state of the art on
   institutional capacity in these regions and make further recommendations
   for sustainable mountain development. The examples from Peru, Ecuador,
   Colombia, and Kyrgyzstan demonstrate that a sound understanding of
   measurement techniques and of the purpose of measurements is necessary
   for successful glacier monitoring. In addition, establishing durable
   institutions, capacity-building programs, and related funding is
   necessary to ensure that glacier monitoring is sustainable and
   maintained in the long term. Therefore, strengthening regional
   cooperation, collaborating with local scientists and institutions, and
   enhancing knowledge sharing and dialogue are envisaged within the GTN-G.
   Finally, glacier monitoring enhances the resilience of the populations
   that depend on water resources from glacierized mountains or that are
   affected by hazards related to glacier changes. We therefore suggest
   that glacier monitoring be included in the development of sustainable
   adaptation strategies in regions with glaciated mountains.}},

Abstract = {{In a chestnut belt in the northern Apennines (Italy), we interviewed
   current (n = 52) and potential growers from a younger generation (n =
   57), to assess what factors are likely to drive their willingness to
   continue chestnut culture. In 35 cases, local appraisals of chestnut
   stand disturbances were also contrasted with expert assessments. More
   than half of current growers were confident about the future of chestnut
   cultivation. This proportion decreased with grower's age and experienced
   issues, while slightly increased in presence of multifunctional
   management and support from family members. Although most growers
   resulted highly capable of diagnosing problems, expert advice
   significantly contributed to driving positive perceptions. About half of
   the younger interviewees also expressed interest in growing chestnut.
   This proportion was higher for respondents who are exposed to chestnut
   culture within the family, and who value cultural services above other
   ecosystem services (ES) of forests. Overall, passion for the activity
   and attachment to local heritage were the most influential motivation
   for both categories of respondents. We outline policy actions that may
   encourage the continuation of chestnut management and, more generally,
   conservation of cultural landscapes in mountain areas. Possible measures
   include financial incentives (e.g., payments for ES), tighter
   integration of traditional and expert knowledge in the production chain,
   and public recognition of the value of local heritage in land
   management. Broader support to maintaining services and infrastructure
   in rural areas, however, will also be a pre-condition. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Understanding species distribution and predicting range shifts are major
   goals of ecology and biogeography. Obtaining reliable predictions of how
   species distribution might change in response to habitat change requires
   knowledge of habitat availability, occupancy, use for breeding, and
   spatial autocorrelation in these parameters. Amphibians in alpine areas
   provide an excellent model system for disentangling habitat drivers of
   occupancy from that of breeding while explicitly accounting for spatial
   autocorrelation. We focused on the widespread common frog (Rana
   temporaria) inhabiting alpine lakes in the Southern Carpathians,
   Romania. We used single season multistate occupancy models developed to
   account for imperfect detection and spatial autocorrelation to estimate
   the occupancy and breeding probabilities and to evaluate their response
   to habitat characteristics. We found that frogs do not occur in all
   water bodies {[}occupancy probability: 0.697; 95\% credible interval
   (0.614, 0.729)] and do not breed in a substantial proportion of water
   bodies where they occur {[}breeding probability conditional on
   occupancy: 0.707; 95\% credible interval (0.670, 0.729)]. Habitat
   characteristics explain water body occupancy but not breeding
   probability; and altitude, water body surface area, water body sinuosity
   and permanency, presence of invertebrates, and grazing along the banks
   all had positive effects on occupancy. We also detected strong spatial
   autocorrelation in occupancy and breeding probabilities. Thus, our
   results indicate that habitat choice by montane amphibians is influenced
   by both spatial autocorrelation and habitat characteristics. Because
   spatial autocorrelations matter and because the presence of adults is
   not the same as the presence of a reproducing population, it will be
   difficult to predict the effects of habitat change on high altitude
   amphibian populations.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Polyploidization plays a key role in plant
   evolution. Despite the generally accepted `mi-nority- cytotype
   exclusion' theory, the specific mechanisms leading to successful
   establishment and persistence of new polyploids remain controversial.
   The majority of newly formed polyploids do not become established,
   because they are less common, have fewer potential mates or may not be
   able to compete successfully with co-occurring progenitors at lower
   ploidy levels. Changes in floral traits and ecological niches have been
   proposed as important mechanisms to overcome this initial
   frequency-dependent disadvantage. The aim of this study was to determine
   whether dodecaploids of the heterostylous P. marginata differ from their
   hexaploid progenitors in P. marginata and P. allionii for selected
   floral traits and ecological preferences that might be involved in
   establishment and persist-ence, providing a possible explanation for the
   origin of polyploidized populations.
   Methods Floral morphological traits and ecological niche preferences
   among dodecaploids and their hexaploid progenitors in P. marginata and
   P. allionii, all restricted to the south-western Alps, were quantified
   and compared
   Key Results Differences in floral traits were detected between
   dodecaploids and their closest relatives, but such differences might be
   too weak to counter the strength of minority cytotype disadvantage and
   are unlikely to enable the coexistence of different cytotypes.
   Furthermore, the results suggest the preservation of full distyly and no
   transi-tion to selfing in dodecaploids. Finally, dodecaploids occur
   almost exclusively in environments that are predicted to be suitable
   also for their closest hexaploid relatives.
   Conclusions In light of the results, P. marginata dodecaploids have
   probably been able to establish and persist by occupying geographical
   areas not yet filled by their closest relatives without significant
   evolution in their climatic and pollination niches. Dispersal limitation
   and minority-cytotype exclusion probably maintain their current range
   disjunct from those of its close relatives.}},

Abstract = {{The fusion of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data is a
   dynamic research area, but image segmentation is rarely treated. While a
   few studies use low-resolution nadir-view optical images, we approached
   the segmentation of SAR and optical images acquired from the same
   airborne platform -leading to an oblique view with high resolution and
   thus increased complexity. To overcome the geometric differences, we
   generated a digital surface model (DSM) from adjacent optical images and
   used it to project both the DSM and SAR data into the optical camera
   frame, followed by segmentation with each channel. The fused
   segmentation algorithm was found to out-perform the single-channel
   version.}},

Abstract = {{At 36 locations worldwide, we estimate the cloud radiative effect
   (CREatm) on atmospheric solar absorption (ASR(atm)) by combining
   ground-based measurements of surface solar radiation (SSR) with
   collocated satellite-derived surface albedo and top-of-atmosphere net
   irradiance under both all-sky and clear-sky conditions. To derive
   continuous clear-sky SSR from Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN)
   in-situ measurements of global and diffuse SSR, we make use of the Long
   and Ackerman (2000) algorithm that identifies clear-sky measurements and
   empirically fits diurnal clear-sky irradiance functions using the cosine
   of the solar zenith angle as the independent variable. The 11-year
   average (2000-2010) CREatm (all-sky minus clear-sky) is overall positive
   at around + 11 Wm(-2) using direct measurements form ground and space,
   and at 4 Wm(-2) in the CERES EBAF dataset. This discrepancy arises from
   a potential overestimation in clear-sky absorption by the satellite
   product or underestimation by the combined BSRN/CERES dataset. The
   forcing ratio R shows that clouds enhance ASRatm most distinctly at
   desert-like locations that overall experience little occurrence of
   clouds. This relationship is captured by both the combined dataset and
   CERES EBAF.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The topographic complexity typical of alpine landscapes
   creates a variety of (micro)climatic conditions that may mitigate the
   effects of a warming climate on alpine plants via such mechanisms as
   cold air pooling (CAP).Aims: Our primary objectives were to (1) assess
   whether landscape potential for CAP as a predictor improved species
   distribution models (SDMs) projections and (2) quantify the impact of
   CAP on the microclimate experienced by alpine plants compared to the
   macroclimate.Methods: We selected the Maritime Alps as our study area,
   located on the French-Italian border, and its rare endemic plant,
   Saxifraga florulenta, as model taxon. We generated a spatial layer in
   GIS (Geographic Information System) that reflected the potential of the
   landscape for CAP and ran five SDM algorithms with and without CAP layer
   as a predictor. Second, we recorded the microclimate plants experience
   with temperature loggers.Results:CAP as a predictor decreased the
   omission error of SDMs, mostly at low and mid elevations, where
   topography may buffer extreme temperatures, resulting in a more stable
   microclimate compared to macroclimate.Conclusions: We have shown that
   plants in an alpine landscape may be less exposed to climate warming
   than predicted by macroclimate. Topo-climatic GIS layers for SDM
   projections in mountain environments should integrate such physical
   mechanisms as CAP.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the processes driving community assembly is a central
   theme in ecology, yet this topic is marginally studied in food webs.
   Bioenergetic models have been instrumental in the development of food
   web theory, using allometric relationships with body mass, temperature,
   and explicit energy flows. However, despite their popularity, little is
   known about the constraints they impose on assembly dynamics. In this
   study, we build on classical consumer-resource theory to analyze the
   implications of the assembly process on trait selection in food webs.
   Using bioenergetic models, we investigate the selective pressure on body
   mass and conversion efficiency and its dependence on trophic structure
   and temperature. We find that the selection exerted by exploitative
   competition is highly sensitive to how the energy fluxes are modeled.
   However, the addition of a trophic level consistently selects for
   smaller body masses of primary producers. An increase in temperature
   triggers important cascading changes in food webs via a reduction of
   producer biomass, which is detrimental to herbivore persistence. This
   affects the structure of trait distributions, which in turn strengthens
   the exploitative competition and the selective pressure on traits. Our
   results suggest that greater attention should be devoted to the effects
   of food web assembly on trait selection to understand the diversity and
   the functioning of real food webs, as well as their possible response to
   ongoing global changes.}},

Abstract = {{Primary successions of glacier forelands are unique model systems to
   investigate community dynamics and assembly processes. However,
   successional changes of plant and insect communities have been mainly
   analysed separately. Therefore, changes in plant-insect interactions
   along successional gradients on glacier forelands remain unknown,
   despite their relevance to ecosystem functioning. This study assessed
   how successional changes of the vegetation influenced the composition of
   the flower-visiting insect assemblages of two plant species,
   Leucanthemopsis alpina (L.) Heyw. and Saxifraga bryoides L., selected as
   the only two insect-pollinated species occurring along the whole
   succession. In addition, we investigated the links between reproductive
   output of these plants and pollinator abundance through experimental
   exclusion of pollinators. Plant community structure changed along the
   succession, affecting the distribution and the abundance of insects via
   idiosyncratic responses of different insect functional groups. L. alpina
   interacted with ubiquitously distributed pollinators, while S. bryoides
   pollinators were positively associated with insect-pollinated plant
   species density and S. bryoides abundance. With succession proceeding,
   insect assemblages became more functionally diverse, with the abundance
   of parasitoids, predators and opportunists positively related to an
   increase in plant cover and diversity. The reproductive output of both
   plant species varied among successional stages. Contrary to our
   expectation, the obligate insect-pollinated L. alpina showed a
   reproductive output rather independent from pollinator abundance, while
   the reproductive output of the self-fertile S. bryoides seemed linked to
   pollinator abundance. Observing ecological interactions and using
   functional traits, we provided a mechanistic understanding of community
   assembly processes along a successional gradient. Plant community
   diversity and cover likely influenced insect community assembly through
   bottom-up effects. In turn, pollinators regulate plant reproductive
   output through top-down control. We emphasise that dynamics of alpine
   plant and insect communities may be structured by biotic interactions
   and feedback processes, rather than only be influenced by harsh abiotic
   conditions and stochastic events.}},

Abstract = {{Microsatellite DNA families (MDF) are stretches of DNA that share
   similar or identical sequences beside nuclear simple-sequence repeat
   (nSSR) motifs, potentially causing problems during nSSR marker
   development. Primers positioned within MDFs can bind several times
   within the genome and might result in multiple banding patterns. It is
   therefore common practice to exclude MDF loci in the course of marker
   development. Here, we propose an approach to deal with multiple
   primer-binding sites by purposefully positioning primers within the
   detected repetitive element. We developed a new protocol to determine
   the family type and the primer position in relation to MDFs using the
   software packages repark and repeatmasker together with an in-house R
   script. We re-evaluated newly developed nSSR markers for the
   lepidopteran Marbled White (Melanargiagalathea) and explored the
   implications of our results with regard to published data sets of the
   butterfly Euphydryas aurinia, the grasshopper Stethophyma grossum, the
   conifer Pinus cembra and the crucifer Arabis alpina. For M.galathea, we
   show that it is not only possible to develop reliable nSSR markers for
   MDF loci, but even to benefit from their presence in some cases: We used
   one unlabelled primer, successfully binding within an MDF, for two
   different loci in a multiplex PCR, combining this family primer with
   uniquely binding and fluorescently labelled primers outside of MDFs,
   respectively. As MDFs are abundant in many taxa, we propose to consider
   these during nSSR marker development in taxa concerned. Our new approach
   might help in reducing the number of tested primers during nSSR marker
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive cytosine methylation is characteristic of plant rDNA. Evidence
   exists, however, that the activer RNA genes are less methylated. In this
   work we report on the mapping of unmethylated CCGG sites in Hordeum
   vulgare rDNA repeats by digestion with methylation sensitive restriction
   enzyme HpaII and indirect end-labeling of the generated fragments. For
   mapping we used genomic DNA from barley deletion line with a single NOR
   on chromosome 5H. This NOR is more active in order to compensate for the
   missing NOR 6H. The enhanced NOR 5H activity in the deletion mutant is
   not due to higher multiplicity of the rRNA genes or, as sequencing
   showed, to changes in the subunit structure of the intergenic spacer.
   The HpaII sites in barley rDNA are heavily methylated. Nevertheless, a
   fraction of the rDNA repeats is hypomethylated with unmethylated CCGG
   sites at various positions. One unmethylated CCGG sequence is close to
   the transcription start site, downstream of the 135 bp subrepeats.
   Unmethylated sites are also present in the external transcribed spacer
   and in the genes coding mature rRNAs. The patterns of unmethylated sites
   in the barley deletion line and in lines with two NORs were compared. It
   is hypothesized that the occurrence of unmethylated sites on a fixed
   subset of rDNA repeats correlates with their transcriptional activity.

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{283}},
Number = {{1840}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{The expected link between competitive exclusion and community trait
   over-dispersion has been used to infer competition in local communities,
   and trait clustering has been interpreted as habitat filtering. Such
   community assembly process inference has received criticism for ignoring
   trophic interactions, as competition and trophic interactions might
   create similar trait patterns. While other theoretical studies have
   generally demonstrated the importance of predation for coexistence, ours
   provides the first quantitative demonstration of such effects on
   assembly process inference, using a trait-based ecological model to
   simulate the assembly of a competitive primary consumer community with
   and without the influence of trophic interactions. We quantified and
   contrasted trait dispersion/clustering of the competitive communities
   with the absence and presence of secondary consumers. Trophic
   interactions most often decreased trait clustering (i.e. increased
   dispersion) in the competitive communities due to evenly distributed
   invasions of secondary consumers and subsequent competitor extinctions
   over trait space. Furthermore, effects of trophic interactions were
   somewhat dependent on model parameters and clustering metric. These
   effects create considerable problems for process inference from trait
   distributions; one potential solution is to use more process-based and
   inclusive models in inference.}},

   and soil type}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{1. While fire-induced changes in biodiversity are well documented, less
   is known about how fire impacts life-history variation and diversity of
   functional traits that represent distinct strategies for persistence in
   fire-driven ecosystems. One example is the dichotomy in which
   `resprouter' species usually survive fires to produce new growth, while
   `reseeder' species perish and re-establish from seed.
   2. Variable relative numbers of reseeder and resprouter species in local
   assemblages of Restionaceae (Poales) of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR),
   and their high species richness and endemism, make this family
   representative of the region's functional, taxonomic and ecological
   diversity.
   3. We investigate how the proportion of resprouter species (resprouter
   fraction) changes among edaphic conditions and along a climate moisture
   (i.e. aridity) gradient that integrates annual precipitation (range
   130-1300 mm) and potential evapotranspiration (range 3-8 mm m(-2)
   day(-1)). We sampled local assemblages using a stratified-random design
   that fully spanned the environmental conditions of the CFR.
   4. As climate moisture across sites with infertile soils increased, so
   did resprouter fraction. Resprouters may increasingly dominate reseeders
   as moisture increases under conditions in which productivity is
   generally limited. This suggests the explanatory hypothesis that in
   these conditions, greater moisture accelerates both biomass accumulation
   (fuel) and fire frequency, providing an advantage to resprouters.
   However, we found no evidence for increasing resprouter fraction with
   increasing climate moisture on more fertile soils.
   5. This statistical interaction suggests the possibility that moisture
   affects resprouter fraction dependent on soil fertility, potentially
   through: (i) impacts on species composition, if soil type acts as an
   environmental filter or promotes biotic interactions, and/or (ii)
   impacts on fire dynamics, potentially through fuel load drying rates.
   Future research should include a comprehensive fire model for the CFR,
   to enable direct examination of relationships of life-history and
   functional traits across variation in fire dynamics. Additionally, our
   results indicate that we need both (i) demographic studies on plant
   establishment, growth rates and survival, and (ii) field experiments
   that address how environmental and biotic filters affect species
   composition across variable fire regimes. These together should
   facilitate mechanistic interpretation of how fire mediates life-history
   variation and diversity of functional traits in the CFR.}},

Abstract = {{Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, there has
   been remarkable enthusiasm for theorising how transitional processes
   have unfolded in post-socialist cities. In seeking to extend literature
   that uses the post-socialist condition as a tool for theory building, we
   draw attention to the ongoing processes of institutional change in
   post-socialist cities. In doing so, we reject a top-down' perspective
   and examine how these institutional transitions are shaped through
   processes of domestication', negotiation and contestation between
   different interest groups in the city. We develop our argument, by
   drawing attention to the local political debates surrounding the
   propiska in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The propiska developed throughout the
   Soviet Union to control internal migration and is still used today in a
   less restrictive form. By discussing our case study, we hope to foster
   attention towards the ongoing contested processes of institutional
   transition in post-socialist cities.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the interaction between dispersal, kinship, and genetic
   structure can provide insights into the factors that shape
   kin-structured mammal societies. Here, we first employ a combination of
   8 years of capture-mark-recapture and molecular data to characterize the
   spatial and genetic relationships among female snow voles (Chionomys
   nivalis) in a population located in the Swiss Alps. Subsequently, we
   examine the individual-level consequences of kin structure in terms of
   fitness and mating patterns. Behavioral data, relatedness estimates, and
   spatial autocorrelation analyses indicate that females show strong
   philopatry, with spatially clustered females being characterized by high
   levels of genetic relatedness, leading to significant small-scale (< 30
   m) spatial genetic structure (SGS). In line with selection favoring
   female philopatry, dispersing females had a lower fitness compared with
   philopatric individuals. However, we found a negative association
   between female reproductive success and the number of neighboring
   females. This suggests that female kin clustering does not constitute an
   adaptive strategy in this species, but rather that site tenacity is a
   by-product of the costs of dispersal. Although dispersal is frequently
   invoked as a means to avoid inbreeding, our results provide no evidence
   for premating inbreeding avoidance, which is in line with previous
   studies on mammals. Instead, in the majority of years, we observed that
   pairs were more-closely related than expected by chance. However, we
   found that both males and females with related partners had reduced
   reproductive success, suggesting the existence of inbreeding depression
   and/or postmating inbreeding avoidance mechanisms. On the whole, our
   results show how quantification of SGS within populations can provide
   insights into individual dispersal behavior and its fitness
   consequences, and into the ways in which social and genetic structure
   interacts to shape the evolution of free-living populations.}},

Abstract = {{The idea that interactions between mutations influence adaptation by
   driving populations to low and high fitness peaks on adaptive landscapes
   is deeply ingrained in evolutionary theory. Here, we investigate the
   impact of epistasis on evolvability by challenging populations of two
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa clones bearing different initial mutations (in
   rpoB conferring rifampicin resistance, and the type IV pili gene
   network) to adaptation to a medium containing L-serine as the sole
   carbon source. Despite being initially indistinguishable in fitness,
   populations founded by the two ancestral genotypes reached different
   fitness following 300 generations of evolution. Genome sequencing
   revealed that the difference could not be explained by acquiring
   mutations in different targets of selection; the majority of clones from
   both ancestors converged on one of the following two strategies: (1)
   acquiring mutations in either PA2449 (gcsR, an L-serine-metabolism RpoN
   enhancer binding protein) or (2) protease genes. Additionally,
   populations from both ancestors converged on loss-of-function mutations
   in the type IV pili gene network, either due to ancestral or acquired
   mutations. No compensatory or reversion mutations were observed in RNA
   polymerase (RNAP) genes, in spite of the large fitness costs typically
   associated with mutations in rpoB. Although current theory points to
   sign epistasis as the dominant constraint on evolvability, these results
   suggest that the role of magnitude epistasis in constraining
   evolvability may be underappreciated. The contribution of magnitude
   epistasis is likely to be greatest under the biologically relevant
   mutation supply rates that make back mutations probabilistically
   unlikely.}},

Abstract = {{The operational sex ratio (OSR: sexually active males: receptive
   females) predicts the intensity of competition for mates. It is less
   clear, however, under what circumstances, the OSR predicts the strength
   of sexual selection - that is, the extent to which variation in mating
   success is attributable to traits that increase the bearer's
   attractiveness and/or fighting ability. To establish causality,
   experiments that manipulate the OSR are required. Furthermore, if it is
   possible to control for any OSR-dependent changes in the chosen sex
   (e.g. changes in male courtship), we can directly test whether the OSR
   affects the behaviour of the choosing sex (e.g. female choice
   decisions). We conducted female mate choice experiments in the field
   using robotic models of male fiddler crabs (Uca mjoebergi). We used a
   novel design with two females tested sequentially per trial. As in
   nature, the choice of the first female to mate therefore affected the
   mates available to the next female. In general, we detected significant
   sexual selection due to female choice for `males' with larger claws.
   Importantly, the strength of sexual selection did not vary across five
   different OSR/density treatments. However, as the OSR decreased (hence
   the number of available males declined), females chose the `males' with
   the largest claws available significantly more often than expected by
   chance. Possible reasons for this mismatch between the expected and
   observed effects of the OSR on the strength of sexual selection are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Antarctica Bedmap2 datasets are used to calculate subglacial hydraulic
   potential and the area, depth and volume of hydraulic potential sinks.
   There are over 32 000 contiguous sinks, which can be thought of as
   predicted lakes. Patterns of subglacial melt are modelled with a
   balanced ice flux flow model, and water fluxes are cumulated along
   predicted flow pathways to quantify steady-state fluxes from the main
   basin outlets and from known subglacial lakes. The total flux from the
   continent is similar to 21 km(3) a(-1). Byrd Glacier has the greatest
   basin flux of similar to 2.7 km(3) a(-1). Fluxes from subglacial lakes
   range from similar to 1 x 10(-4) to similar to 1.5 km(3) a(-1). Lake
   turnover times are calculated from their volumes and fluxes, and have
   median values of similar to 100 a for known `active' lakes and similar
   to 500 a for other lakes. Recurrence intervals of a 0.25 km(3) flood
   range from similar to 2 months to similar to 2000 a (median approximate
   to 130 a) for known `active' lakes and from similar to 2 to similar to
   2400 a (median approximate to 360 a) for other lakes. Thus, several
   lakes that have recently been observed to fill and drain may not do so
   again for many centuries; and several lakes that have not, so far, been
   observed to fill and drain have the potential to do so, even at annual
   to decadal timescales.}},

Title = {{Evolutionary ecology of pipefish brooding structures: embryo survival

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{For animals that reproduce in water, many adaptations in life-history
   traits such as egg size, parental care, and behaviors that relate to
   embryo oxygenation are still poorly understood. In pipefishes, seahorses
   and seadragons, males care for the embryos either in some sort of brood
   pouch, or attached ventrally to the skin on their belly or tail.
   Typically, egg size is larger in the brood pouch group and it has been
   suggested that oxygen supplied via the pouch buffers the developing
   embryos against hypoxia and as such is an adaptation that has
   facilitated the evolution of larger eggs. Here, using four pipefish
   species, we tested whether the presence or absence of brood pouch
   relates to how male behavior, embryo size, and survival are affected by
   hypoxia, with normoxia as control. Two of our studied species Entelurus
   aequoreus and Nerophis ophidion (both having small eggs) have simple
   ventral attachment of eggs onto the male trunk, and the other two,
   Syngnathus typhle (large eggs) and S. rostellatus (small eggs), have
   fully enclosed brood pouches on the tail. Under hypoxia, all species
   showed lower embryo survival, while species with brood pouches suffered
   greater embryo mortality compared to pouchless species, irrespective of
   oxygen treatment. Behaviorally, species without pouches spent more time
   closer to the surface, possibly to improve oxygenation. Overall, we
   found no significant benefits of brood pouches in terms of embryo
   survival and size under hypoxia. Instead, our results suggest negative
   effects of large egg size, despite the protection of brood pouches.}},

Abstract = {{Marine Isotope Stage 11 (MIS 11; ca. 423-362 ka) is generally considered
   to be the best analogue for the present interglacial (Holocene), and
   investigation of it will improve our understanding of current climate
   variability and assist in predictions of future climate change. However,
   many recent studies primarily focus on the structure and duration of MIS
   11. Little research has focused on climate warmth and stability recorded
   in the Chinese loess-paleosol sequences (LPS) during the S4 paleosol
   formation (equivalent to MIS 11). On the basis of previous work, this
   study presents a high-resolution record (ca. 75 a/cm) that spans from
   MIS 1 to MIS 15, as preserved in the thickest known Jingyuan loess
   section on the western Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). This LPS is almost
   165 m thick and was sampled from the upper part of L6 to the modern soil
   at 2-cm depth intervals. Measurements of magnetic susceptibility, mean
   grain size and > 63 A mu m particle content, carbonate content, total
   organic carbon, and soil color of samples were made to reconstruct the
   paleoclimate variation, and a grain-size age model was used to constrain
   the chronological framework. The primary results show that a generally
   warm-humid climate dominated the S4 paleosol development, but the
   climate condition was extremely unstable during the whole of MIS 11. Two
   obviously different climate regimes controlled the MIS 11 climate
   variation: the early part of MIS 11 was extremely warm and stable, but
   the latter part was relatively cool (non-glacial) and unstable. This
   climate pattern was consistent with records on the central CLP and
   wavelet analysis suggested that it was forced by the 65A degrees N
   insolation variability modulated by a quasi-100-ka cycle. In addition, a
   multi-proxy comparative study on the climate conditions during S0 to S5
   paleosol development indicates that the period of S4 development might
   be the warmest interglacial of the past 650 ka. However, the climate
   condition during S4 development was not the most humid episode as
   recorded in Xifeng and Luochuan loess sections on the central CLP. On
   the contrary, it was drier than both the MIS 15 and the present
   interglacial on the western CLP, which is somewhat similar to the
   present climate pattern on the central CLP.}},

Abstract = {{Weedy plants affect the biodiversity and ecosystem function as well as
   the crop and fodder plant production. However, adequate management
   requires detailed knowledge of the taxonomic identity of these plants.
   Here, we focused on a hemiparasitic Pedicularis species (Orobanchaceae),
   which occurs at high densities and results in significant biomass
   reductions in forage grasses in Bayanbulak Grassland of Xinjiang. The
   identity of this target species is not clear, with conflicting reports
   in publications and in herbarium collections. Hence, clear and
   management-relevant information on demography and reproductive ecology
   is difficult to be obtained from the literature. Therefore, we analyzed
   field and archival materials collected from Xinjiang in order to clarify
   the identity and distribution of the target species. Morphological
   analyses suggested that the populations at Bayanbulak Grassland should
   be Pedicularis kansuensis Maxim. rather than P. verticillata L. which
   has been accepted in the available literature. Phylogenetic analysis
   with a combination of three barcodes (matK, rbcL and trnH-psbA) uniting
   a clade of P. kansuensis and individuals from Bayanbulak Grassland
   populations with 100\% bootstrap support, confirmed the target species
   to be P. kansuensis. Anatomical investigations and field observations
   showed that the target species is an annual or biennial herb, which also
   fits with the life cycle as P. kansuensis. Based on archive material and
   field observations, we verified that the distribution of P. kansuensis
   is mainly concentrated in the Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang.}},

Abstract = {{Conditional adjustment of cooperativeness to the expected pay-off might

   Parental care provided towards all offspring in a communal nest

   Females indiscriminately caring for all young share the costs equally,
   but the pay-off may vary depending on their contribution to the joint
   nest (number of own offspring). Females with fewer offspring in the
   joint nest will be exploited and overinvest relative to their
   contribution. We experimentally created a situation of high conflict in
   communally nursing house mice, by using a genetic tool to create a
   difference in birth litter sizes. Females in the high conflict situation
   (unequal litter sizes at birth) showed a reduced propensity to give
   birth as part of a communal nest, therefore adjusting their
   cooperativeness to the circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{It is trite to say ``publish or perish,{''} yet many early career
   researchers are often at a loss on how to best get their work published.
   With strong competition and many manuscripts submitted, it is difficult
   to convince editors and reviewers to opt for acceptance. A pragmatic
   approach to publishing may increase one's odds of success. Here, we - a
   group of postdocs in the field of plant science - present specific
   recommendations for early career scientists on advanced levels. We
   cannot provide a recipe-like set of instructions with success
   guaranteed, but we come from a broad background in plant science, with
   experience publishing in a number of journals of varying topics and
   impact factors. We provide tips, tricks, and tools for collaboration,
   journal selection, and achieving acceptance.}},

Abstract = {{Future climate change may lead to a substantial loss of biodiversity,
   particularly affecting mountain regions, including the Alps. Range-size
   reduction in high mountain plant species is predicted to be more
   pronounced for endemic species. Investigating the broad temporal
   spectrum of range shifts is important for the conservation of
   biodiversity, since learning how species responded to climate change in
   the past provides useful insights on how they might react to warming
   trends in the present and future. Using species distribution models and
   an ensemble forecasting approach, we explored how the distribution of
   Berardia subacaulis, a monospecific genus endemic of the south-west
   Alps, may be affected by past and future projected climate change.
   During the last interglacial, the habitat suitability of Berardia was
   lower than present and a progressive increase was observed from the last
   glacial maximum until now. In the future, Berardia appears to lose more
   than 80 \% of its range, becoming endangered by 2050. Our results
   suggest that Berardia probably survived past warmer periods in situ,
   expanding its distributional range during cooler periods. The severe
   future range contraction predicted for Berardia reflects similar results
   for other endemic species. As Berardia represents an interesting model
   species to evaluate the effects of climate warming on range size and
   shifts, demographic and precise range monitoring may be undertaken on
   this species.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional concepts about trophic niches in mammals are often linked
   to adaptations of digestive physiology, and so carnivory by herbivorous
   animals is often considered a physiological impossibility. However,
   numerous reports on events of carnivory in herbivores without apparent
   harmful consequences exist. Here, we report the habitual daily
   consumption of animal prey (day-old chicks and rodents) by two rabbits
   kept in a mixed-species exhibit with raptors over a period of 9 months.
   While not requiring a change of the classification of rabbits as strict
   herbivores, anecdotes like this one suggest that some trophic niches
   might be better explained by other factors than digestive physiology,
   such as ecological opportunity, behavioural adaptations and
   biomechanical limits to ingestion.}},

   together some 30 scientists and managers from all Alpine countries and
   different types of protected areas (PA) and allowed discussing the
   goals, composition, organization and management of scientific councils.
   While based on experiences in Alpine countries, these recommendations
   can be applied to managed PAs in general.
   They are addressed to PA managers and scientists involved or interested
   in participating in scientific councils, as well as to the PA executive
   boards and administrations in charge of PA management and policy. They
   intend to help decide if and when to establish a scientific council and
   how to compose, organize and manage it if such a decision has been made,
   is planned or envisaged. Given the diversity of national regulations and
   practices, they remain rather general: the aim is to identify the
   questions to bear in mind when establishing or renewing a scientific
   council rather than to give predefined or definitive answers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Connections between mature trees and seedlings via
   ectomycorrhizal (EcM) hyphal networks existing in dipterocarp-dominated
   tropical rain forests of South- east Asia could have strong implications
   for seedling growth and survival and the maintenance of high diversity
   in such forests.
   Aim: To test whether EcM hyphal network connections are important for
   the growth and survival of dipterocarp seedlings.
   Methods: We conducted four independent experiments that prevented
   contact of experimental seedlings with an EcM network by using a series
   of fine meshes and/ or plastic barriers. We measured the growth and
   survival (and foliar delta C-13 in one experiment) of seedlings of six
   dipterocarp species over intervals ranging from 11 to 29 months.
   Results: Seedling growth (diameter, height or leaf number) was
   unaffected by exclusion from the EcM network in three experiments and
   there were no differences in foliar d13C values in the fourth. Seedling
   survival was reduced following exclusion from the EcM network in one
   experiment. Our results give little support to the hypothesis that
   dipterocarp seedlings growing in the shaded forest understorey benefit
   from being connected, through a common EcM network, to surrounding
   trees.
   Conclusions: We suggest that our negative results, in contrast to
   studies conducted in low diversity boreo- temperate or tropical forests,
   are due to these high diversity forests lacking host species-specific
   EcM fungi and therefore providing little opportunity for adaptive
   support of seedlings via hyphal networks.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are complex software environments
   and we often work with multiple tasks and multiple displays when we work
   with GIS. However, user input is still limited to mouse and keyboard in
   most workplace settings. In this project, we demonstrate how the use of
   gaze and feet as additional input modalities can overcome time-consuming
   and annoying mode switches between frequently performed tasks. In an
   iterative design process, we developed gaze-and foot-based methods for
   zooming and panning of map visualizations. We first collected
   appropriate gestures in a preliminary user study with a small group of
   experts, and designed two interaction concepts based on their input.
   After the implementation, we evaluated the two concepts comparatively in
   another user study to identify strengths and shortcomings in both. We
   found that continuous foot input combined with implicit gaze input is
   promising for supportive tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Informal settlements are a common occurrence in South Africa, and to
   improve in-situ circumstances of communities living in informal
   settlements, upgrades and urban design processes are necessary. Spatial
   data and maps are essential throughout these processes to understand the
   current environment, plan new developments, and communicate the planned
   developments. All stakeholders need to understand maps to actively
   participate in the process. However, previous research demonstrated that
   map literacy was relatively low for many planning professionals in South
   Africa, which might hinder effective planning. Because 3D visualizations
   resemble the real environment more than traditional maps, many
   researchers posited that they would be easier to interpret. Thus, our
   goal is to investigate the effectiveness of 3D geovisualizations for
   urban design in informal settlement upgrading in South Africa. We
   consider all involved processes: 3D modelling, visualization design, and
   cognitive processes during map reading. We found that procedural
   modelling is a feasible alternative to time-consuming manual modelling,
   and can produce high quality models. When investigating the
   visualization design, the visual characteristics of 3D models and
   relevance of a subset of visual variables for urban design activities of
   informal settlement upgrades were qualitatively assessed. The results of
   three qualitative user experiments contributed to understanding the
   impact of various levels of complexity in 3D city models and map
   literacy of future geoinformatics and planning professionals when using
   2D maps and 3D models. The research results can assist planners in
   designing suitable 3D models that can be used throughout all phases of
   the process.}},

Abstract = {{Since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA, ca. 1850 AD) a general and
   progressive retreat of glaciers started in the European Alps, causing
   important environmental changes in this high mountain region. The
   appearance of glacier lakes is one of the most evident environmental
   effects in the Alps as well as in newly deglaciated areas worldwide. In
   order to understand conditions of formation and reconstruct evolutionary
   stages of glacier lakes, it is important to collect and analyse a
   diversity of data from different time periods. Through the analysis of
   historical topographic maps and digital orthophotos, we identified and
   digitalized in a GIS environment glacier lakes (and related features) of
   the Western Italian Alps (Piemonte and Aosta Valley regions) within the
   LIA maximum extent boundaries. We produced six glacier lake inventories
   related to six different time steps: 1930s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2006-07
   and 2012. We provided a general overview of the main morphometric,
   geomorphologic and geographic features of lakes of each time step and
   preliminary considerations on changes in the number of lakes within the
   considered time period. The most detailed analysis has been performed
   over the 2006-07 time step: 214 detected lakes, covering a total area of
   about 146 (+/- 1). 10(4) m(2), 3/4 of the lakes measuring less than 6000
   m(2) as individual area and a half of the total number less than 2000
   m(2). The mean elevation of lakes was 2776 m a.s.l., 72\% being located
   between 2600 and 3000 m. In general, lakes are localized mainly in the
   Graian Alps (Rutor-Lechaud, Gran Sassiere-Tsanteleina and Gran Paradiso
   chains) and in the Pennine Alps (Monte Rosa Group). Moreover, in a
   dedicated database, we collected information (descriptions, photos,
   maps) about glacier lakes from the reports of the annual glaciological
   surveys published by the Italian Glaciological Committee (CGI) since
   1928. Finally, we reported two cases of glacier lakes at the Tzere
   Glacier (Monte Rosa Group, Pennine Alps) and at the Ban Glacier (Monte
   Leone-Blinnenhorn Chain, Lepontine Alps), in order to demonstrate the
   importance of integrating data from a diversity of sources (historical
   maps, orthophotos and reports of the glaciological surveys) for better
   detailed reconstructions of the condition of formation, evolutionary
   stages and process dynamics of the lake. Results of the present research
   can contribute to reconstruct and to interpret the spatiotemporal
   evolution of the phenomenon and to improve the knowledge about the
   interactions between glacier and related glacier lakes.}},

Title = {{Using molecular tools to guide management of invasive alien species:
   assessing the genetic impact of a recently introduced island bird

Abstract = {{Aim Biological invasions are a major threat to island biodiversity and
   are responsible for a large proportion of species declines and
   extinctions worldwide. The process of hybridization between invasive and
   native species is a major factor that contributes to the loss of endemic
   genetic diversity. The issue of hybridization is often overlooked in the
   management of introduced species because morphological evidence of
   hybridization may be difficult to recognize in the field. Molecular
   techniques, however, facilitate identification of specific hybridization
   events and assessment of the direction and timing of introgression. We
   use molecular markers to track hybridization in a population of an
   island endemic bird, the Aldabra fody (Foudia aldabrana), following the
   recent discovery of a co-occurring population of non-native Madagascar
   fodies (Foudia madagascariensis).
   Location Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles.
   Methods We combine phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear
   markers to assess whether hybridization has occurred between
   F.madagascariensis and F.aldabrana on Aldabra. Using coalescence models
   and comparing different hybridization scenarios, we estimate the timing
   of such events and confirm the geographic origin of F.madagascariensis.
   Results Our analyses confirm a recent hybridization event between the
   two species of Foudia, and we find evidence that the invasive
   F.madagascariensis originate from the neighbouring island of Assumption,
   where they were introduced in the 1970s.
   Main conclusions Our results validate the threat of losing the unique
   genetic diversity of F.aldabrana through admixture due to recent
   invasion of F.madagascariensis. We show that molecular analyses can be a
   valuable tool in formulating strategies for the management of invasive
   birds.}},

Abstract = {{In AD 1315, the Habsburgs fought against the Swiss Confederation at
   Morgarten. Since historical records are very limited, the battle has
   been the subject of very controversial discussions. Its location and
   outcome seem likely to have been influenced by the landscape and the
   size of the Aegeri lake, but only sparse and contradictory information
   are available. Numerical, semi-quantitative and relative dating
   techniques were applied to reconstruct the lake's dimensions and the
   landscape. Results obtained from radiocarbon dating of mires (last
   sedimentation phase of the lake), geomorphic mapping, geoelectrics, soil
   maps (surface age indication) and archaeological findings were pieced
   together and gave an astonishingly good consensus. In the Lateglacial,
   the lake level was higher (750-760m a.s.l.): because of a catastrophic
   event, it decreased by 25m. About 5500 BP, the lake level was at 732m
   a.s.l., and since the Roman period, it has varied between 724 and 727m
   a.s.l. At the time of the battle the lake was at 726m - that is, about
   2m higher than today. Together with the cooler climate, the greater
   extension of the fens and larger lake, the valley floor was wet and
   unpleasant. If a Habsburg army had to cross this region, they would
   likely have preferred to walk on a more accessible trail along the
   footslopes (where they probably were attacked). Precise landscape
   reconstruction provides new input for historical research. Details about
   the exact location of the battle, however, remain unclear, and the myth
   of the battle at Morgarten persists.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{747-759}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{All grass species evolved from an ancestor that underwent a whole-genome
   duplication (WGD) approximately 70 million years ago. Interestingly, the
   short arms of rice chromosomes 11 and 12 (and independently their
   homologs in sorghum) were found to be much more similar to each other
   than other homeologous regions within the duplicated genome. Based on
   detailed analysis of rice chromosomes 11 and 12 and their homologs in
   seven grass species, we propose a mechanism that explains the apparently
   `younger' age of the duplication in this region of the genome, assuming
   a small number of reciprocal translocations at the chromosome termini.
   In each case the translocations were followed by unbalanced transmission
   and subsequent lineage sorting of the involved chromosomes to offspring.
   Molecular dating of these translocation events also allowed us to date
   major chromosome `fusions' in the evolutionary lineages that led to
   Brachypodium and Triticeae. Furthermore, we provide evidence that rice
   is exceptional regarding the evolution of chromosomes 11 and 12,
   inasmuch as in other species the process of sequence exchange between
   homeologous chromosomes ceased much earlier than in rice. We presume
   that random events rather than selective forces are responsible for the
   observed high similarity between the short arm ends of rice chromosomes
   11 and 12.}},

Pages = {{101-112}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The altitudinal gradient involves changes of the partial pressures of
   atmospheric gases such as CO2. This omnipresent phenomenon likely
   represents an evolutionary selective agent. We asked whether high
   altitude plant species had evolved specific response strategies to cope
   with high altitude pressure conditions. Plants of the high altitude
   species Arabis alpina and the low altitude species Arabidopsis thaliana
   were cultivated in growth chambers with high altitude pressure
   conditions (corresponding to 3000 m a.s.l.) and low altitude conditions
   (560 m). In both species, high altitude conditions resulted in the
   narrowing of stomatal aperture as well as a decrease in leaf area and
   weight. A. alpina produced significantly more stomata under high
   altitude conditions compared to low altitude conditions, while A.
   thaliana did not. Under low altitude conditions, however, stomatal
   density of A. alpina was smaller compared to A. thaliana. The increase
   in stomatal density of A. alpina was strongly related to the decrease in
   the partial pressure of CO2 under high altitude conditions. Thus, the
   adaptation of the high altitude plant A. alpina to high altitude
   pressure conditions does not consist in a genetically fixed elevated
   stomatal density but in a different response strategy of stomatal
   development to environmental factors compared to the lowland plant A.
   thaliana. A. alpina developed stomata largely uncoupled from other
   environmental factors than CO2. The increased stomatal density of A.
   alpina may ensure an optimal CO2 supply during the periods of favourable
   weather conditions for photosynthesis that are relatively rare and short
   in the alpine life zone.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual size dimorphism (SSD), a difference in body size between sexes,
   is common in many taxa. In insects, females are larger than males in >
   70\% of all taxa in most orders. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster
   is one prominent model organism to investigate SSD since its clear and
   representative female-biased SSD and its growth regulation are well
   studied. Elucidating the number and nature of genetic elements that can
   potentially influence SSD would be helpful in understanding the
   evolutionary potential of SSD. Here, we investigated the SSD pattern
   caused by artificially introduced genetic variation in D. melanogaster,
   and examined whether variation in SSD was mediated by the sex-specific
   modification of developmental time. To map the genomic regions that had
   effects on sexual wing size and/or developmental time differences
   (SDtD), we reanalyzed previously published genome-wide deficiency
   mapping data to evaluate the effects of 376 isogenic deficiencies
   covering a total of similar to 67\% of the genomic regions of the second
   and third chromosomes of D. melanogaster. We found genetic variation in
   SSD and SDtD generated by genomic deficiencies, and a negative genetic
   correlation between size and development time. We also found SSD and
   SDtD allometries that are not qualitatively congruent, which however
   overall at best only partly help in explaining the patterns found. We
   identified several genomic deficiencies with the tendency to either
   exaggerate or suppress SSD, in agreement with quantitative genetic null
   expectations of many loci with small effects. These novel findings
   contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary potential of
   sexual dimorphism.}},

Abstract = {{The present report describes two proven cases of illegal poisoning of
   peregrine falcons in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Both animals died
   in their eyries after capturing and feeding on a methomyl-laced pigeon.
   Both eyries are surveillanced by cameras, and the death of one falcon
   was broadcasted live on the Internet. The city game warden had noticed
   the disappearance of a brooding female from an artificial eyrie in 2009
   and had found five dead falcons at plucking posts or artificial eyries
   between 2009 and 2013. Owing to these reports in combination with
   reports on the disappearance of at least eight pairs of peregrine
   falcons from traditionally used nesting sites in north-western
   Switzerland since the 1980s, the authors presume that there may be a
   high number of unreported cases of illegal killing of peregrine falcons

Abstract = {{Whenever allele frequencies are unequal, nonadditive gene action
   contributes to additive genetic variance and therefore the resemblance
   between parents and offspring. The reason for this has not been easy to
   understand. Here, we present a new single-locus decomposition of
   additive genetic variance that may give greater intuition about this
   important result. We show that the contribution of dominant gene action
   to parent-offspring resemblance only depends on the degree to which the
   heterozygosity of parents and offspring covary. Thus, dominant gene
   action only contributes to additive genetic variance when heterozygosity
   is heritable. Under most circumstances this is the case because
   individuals with rare alleles are more likely to be heterozygous, and
   because they pass rare alleles to their offspring they also tend to have
   heterozygous offspring. When segregating alleles are at equal frequency
   there are no rare alleles, the heterozygosities of parents and offspring
   are uncorrelated and dominant gene action does not contribute to
   additive genetic variance.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the seasonal timing of life history events are documented
   effects of climate change. We used a general model to study how
   dispersal and competitive interactions affect eco-evolutionary responses
   to changes in the temporal distribution of resources over the season.
   Specifically, we modeled adaptation of the timing of reproduction and
   population dynamic responses in two competing populations that disperse
   between two habitats characterized by an early and late resource peak.
   We investigated three scenarios of environmental change: (1) food peaks
   advance in both habitats, (2) in the late habitat only and (3) in the
   early habitat only. At low dispersal rates the evolutionarily stable
   timing of reproduction closely matched the local resource peak and the
   environmental change typically caused population decline. Larger
   dispersal rates rendered less intuitive eco-evolutionary population
   responses. First, dispersal caused mismatch between evolutionarily
   stable timing of reproduction and local resource peaks and as a result,
   reproductive output for subpopulations could increase as well as
   decrease when resource availability underwent temporal shifts. Second,
   population responses were contingent on competition between populations.
   This could accelerate population declines and cause extinctions or even
   reverse population trends from negative to positive compared to the low
   dispersal case. When dispersal rate was large and the early resource
   peak was advanced available niche space was reduced. Hence, even when a
   population survived the environmental change and obtained positive
   equilibrium population density, subsequent adaptation of competing
   populations could drive it to extinction due to convergent evolution and
   competitive exclusion. These results shed new light on the role of
   competition and dispersal for the evolution of timing of life history
   events and provide guidelines for understanding short and long-term
   population response to climate change.}},

   with pollinators; however, the evolutionary dynamics of non-floral
   organs involved in pollination are poorly studied. The genus Macaranga
   is characterized by protective mutualisms with ants that potentially
   interfere with pollinators on flowers. Macaranga flowers lack perianths
   and, notably, bracteoles serve the dual function of rewarding
   pollinators and protecting them from guarding ants; in one group of
   species, bracteoles provide a nectar reward to generalist pollinators,
   while in another group, bracteole ``chambers{''} protect thrips or
   hemipteran pollinators that use these structures as feeding and breeding
   sites. We examined the diversity and evolutionary dynamics of
   inflorescence morphology in Macaranga, focusing on bracteoles. We
   recognized three inflorescence types based on examination of herbarium
   materials: Discoid-gland, which possess disc-shaped glands on the
   bracteole surfaces (including all the generalist-pollinated species);
   Enclosing, in which bracteoles cover flowers (including all the thrips-
   and hemipteran-pollinated species); and Inconspicuous, in which
   bracteoles are small, narrow or absent. Ancestral state reconstruction
   indicated that inflorescence morphologies have changed multiple times in
   the genus. These findings suggest that morphological changes in
   non-floral characters (bracteoles) of Macaranga species have occurred as
   frequently as in the floral structures of many flowering plants. The
   multiple evolutions of the Enclosing bracteoles, which protect
   pollinators, might have been facilitated by pollination interference
   from mutualistic ants.}},

Abstract = {{Mating success depends not only on genetic and phenotypic
   characteristics of males and females but also on their spatial position
   relative to other individuals, which influences the chances for
   interactions. Hence, any behavior that affects proximity to other
   individuals can potentially translate into fitness gain or loss. Here,
   we investigate the effects of genotype on male movement and distance to
   nearest neighbor (DNN) in three populations of the edible frog
   Pelophylax esculentus, a natural hybrid between its parental species
   Pelophylax ridibundus (genotype RR) and Pelophylax lessonae (LL). The
   system is particularly suited for such an analysis because the fitness
   differences between mating with a certain genotype are particularly
   strong. Moreover, which genotype should be preferred differs among
   populations where diploid hybrids (LR) live in sympatry with P. lessonae
   (L-E system) and those where diploid hybrids occur in all-hybrid
   populations together with triploids (LLR and/or LRR) (E-E system).
   Hence, we expected differences among genotypes in movement patterns and
   spatial arrangement within the breeding pond. We did, indeed, find such
   differences. They were predominantly due to density differences between
   populations, followed by size and condition differences between males.
   Most relevant for our question was a difference in DNN: in the E-E
   system, distances between all three hybrid types were equal, whereas in
   the L-E system LR hybrids tended to stay closer to LL than to other LR.
   The results are discussed in relation to previous mate choice
   experiments and theoretical models about mating preferences in the two
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a simple comparison of the distributions of land
   cover features identified from volunteered data contributed by different
   social groups - in this case comparing two groups of Geo-Wiki campaigns.
   Understanding the impacts on analyses of citizen science data
   contributed by different groups is critical to ensure robust scientific
   outputs and to fully realise the potential benefits to formal scientific
   research. It is well known that different people, with different
   backgrounds and subject to different cultural factors, hold varying
   landscape conceptualisations. This paper analyses volunteered
   geographical information on land cover to generate land cover maps. It
   uses a geographically weighted approach to generate land cover mappings.
   The mappings generated by different groups (in this case a from a
   specific unnamed country) are compared and the results show how the
   predicted land cover distributions vary, with large differences in some
   classes (e.g. Barren land, Shrubland, Wetland) and little difference in
   others (e.g. Tree cover). This suggests that for some landscape features
   cultural and national differences matter when it comes to using
   crowdsourced data in formal scientific analyses and highlights the
   potential problems of not considering contributor backgrounds in citizen
   science. This is important because such data re now routinely being used
   to develop global land cover data, to generate uncertainty estimates of
   existing global land cover products and to generate global forest
   inventories. These in turn are being suggested as suitable inputs to
   such things as global climate models. A number of critical research
   directions arising from these findings are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Manifold alignment has become very popular in recent literature.
   Aligning data distributions prior to product generation is an appealing
   strategy, since it allows to provide data spaces that are more similar
   to each other, regardless of the subsequent use of the transformed data.
   We propose a methodology that finds a common representation among data
   spaces from different sensors using geographic image correspondences, or
   semantic ties. To cope with the strong deformations between the data
   spaces considered, we propose to add nonlinearities by expanding the
   input space with Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) features with
   respect to the centroids of a partitioning of the data. Such features
   allow us to cope with nonlinear transformations, while keeping a simple
   and efficient linear formulation. The proposed method is multi-domain
   and does not require co-registration, rather only a partial degree of
   spatial overlap. We test it on a challenging problem of multisensor
   classification transferring a model trained on a WorldView 2 image to
   predict land cover of a 3-bands orthophoto and show that we can transfer
   the model with an accuracy comparable to the one that would have been
   obtained by a model trained on the target image with an image-specific
   ground truth.}},

   persistence and performance of these lines without competition and in
   experimental weed Communities in the field, their seed germination in
   the laboratory, their survival in fallow plots and effects on
   post-harvest vegetation in the field.
   In competition with weeds, the GM lines showed reduced seed number,
   plant height and biomass allocation to seeds than their corresponding
   non-GM lines. No such performance differences were observed without
   competition. The seedlings of GM lines did not persist longer than those
   of the corresponding non-GM lines in fallow plots. In the field, GM and
   non-GM wheat lines had similar performance and persistence and both were
   able to reproduce in dense weed communities and to survive during winter
   on fallow plots. Stored in soil in the laboratory, the seeds of GM and
   non-GM lines either germinated quickly or lost their viability after 3
   months. GM and non-GM lines had no differential effects on the structure
   and diversity of fallow plant communities within the 6-month period of
   monitoring. Poor seed longevity yet successful plant persistence in weed
   communities or on fallow plots indicate that not removing a population
   of growing plants presents a greater risk than allowing the build-up of
   a soil seed bank regarding the potential escape of transgenic wheat to
   the environment. Strong varietal differences in persistence point out
   the importance of case-by-case assessment of new GM varieties and
   indicate that transgenic traits should preferably be introduced into
   varieties with low persistence. (C) 2015 Geobotanisches Institut ETH,

Abstract = {{Section S1.1.5 describes which chemical elements are available for life.
   The dry mass of all cells is predominantly composed of the major
   bioelements (Table S1.2), which are the nonmetals C, H, O, N, P, and S
   and the four metals Na, K, Mg, and Ca. These elements built the
   macromolecules and metabolites of the cell, they counteract the (mainly)
   negative charges of the macromolecules, they form concentration
   gradients, stabilize biological membranes and bridge negative charges.
   In addition to these major bioelements, however, minor bioelements or
   trace elements are needed (Table S1.3). Some of these trace elements
   belong to the nonmetals: the halogens Cl, Br, and I as well as B and Se.
   The minor nonmetallic bioelements are necessary to form halogenated or
   borated compounds, for Se-cysteine instead of sulfur-containing
   ``normal{''} cysteine in some enzymes, and for many functions in case of
   Cl. Section 11.1 describes how plants that need major and minor
   bioelements as macro-and micronutrient take up these elements and
   regulate the metabolism of mineral nutrients, especially that of
   nitrogen, phosphorous, iron, zinc, and copper. Most minor bioelements,
   however, are transition metals, and these are essential at low but also
   toxic at higher concentrations. Other transition metals are
   ``toxic-only.{''} This chapter provides an introduction into the
   biochemistry of transition metals and how cells deal with their
   essential-and-toxic and toxic-only representatives.}},

Title = {{A message from magic to science: seeing how the brain can be tricked may
   strengthen our thinking}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Scientific discoveries rely on creative thinking, and several authors
   have explored similarities in and differences between creativity in the
   sciences and that in the arts. Here we explore possible ways in which
   science can learn from the arts, focusing specifically on experiences
   derived from the art of magic and on the limitations of human cognition.
   Generations of stage magicians or ``illusionists{''} have made
   sophisticated use of the weaknesses in human systems of perception and
   interpretation. We highlight three important principles of magic tricks,
   including: (1) the audience see what it expects, (2) it is blind to all
   but the focus of attention, and (3) ideas spring predictably from a
   primed mind. These principles highlight a number of important
   tendencies, which we argue are shortcomings in the ability of scientists
   to perceive the world, and which scientists need to be aware of.
   Consciously addressing these shortcomings may help scientists improve
   their creativity, and will strengthen their capacity to address complex
   and global challenges.}},

Pages = {{55-66}},

Abstract = {{Rattan palms are dominant elements of Southeast Asian rainforests and of
   high economic importance, yet little is known about the ecological
   factors determining the spatial distribution of species and assemblages.
   We studied rattan palm assemblages at two sites at different elevations
   in Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia (Pono: 958-1,266 m;
   Bariri: 1,390-1,507 m). At each site, we established a transect of 1.29
   km consisting of 65 study plots of 10 x 10 m(2) each, regularly spaced
   20 m from each other. In total, we recorded 5,081 rattan individuals
   belonging to 22 species, with 1,367 individuals of 16 species at Pono
   and 3,714 individuals of 8 species at Bariri. Variance partitioning
   explained 29-49 \% of community variation at Pono and 40-72 \% at
   Bariri, with most variation jointly explained by spatial and
   environmental variables. Within the environmental influence, soil
   factors dominated over local topographical ones. RDA ordination allowed
   the discrimination of four species groups at Pono and three groups at
   Bariri. These groups were related to soil and less clearly to
   topographic variables. Our study is the first documentation of the
   importance of soil parameters in determining the spatial distribution of
   rattan palms. Interestingly, juvenile palms (< 1 m tall) showed closer
   relationships to environmental factors than adult plants (> 1 m tall),
   calling for further studies on the demography of rattan palms.}},

   settlements: testing a tripartite model}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{485-500}},
Abstract = {{Tenure security is widely believed to contribute to low-income
   settlement development by encouraging investment in housing improvement.
   However, in spite of consensus about its importance, it is still unclear
   what tenure security exactly entails and few studies have examined how
   it relates to housing improvement. Using survey data from six informal
   neighborhoods in Buenos Aires, Argentina, we empirically test a model
   that specifies how the different types of tenure security that feature
   in academic and policy debates relate to each other, and the extent to
   which each predicts investment in housing improvement. We find that
   legal tenure security and de facto security of tenure influence
   investment in part through increases in perceptions of tenure security.
   We conclude that the hypothesized model accurately predicts investment
   in housing improvement and discuss how these findings inform current
   debates on tenure security and informality.}},

Abstract = {{To satisfy the growing demand for electricity, Ethiopia plans to
   increase its electricity production five-fold between 2010 and 2015,
   mainly through the construction of dams. A literature review shows that
   while dams can boost power and agricultural production, promote economic
   development, and facilitate flood control, they can also lead to
   environmental, ecological, and socioeconomic changes. Several case
   studies show that dams may alter the composition and density of vectors
   and intermediate host species, increase the incidence of malaria
   schistosomiasis and possibly lymphatic filariasis, and lead to
   eutrophication of reservoirs, soil erosion, and earthquakes. There is
   evidence that dams and commercial irrigation schemes can increase soil
   and water degradation, vulnerability to drought, and food insecurity in
   riverine and lacustrine areas downstream of dams. It appears that dams
   in Ethiopia are also vulnerable to high soil erosion rates and
   earthquakes. Consequently, the current and proposed large-scale dam
   construction program in Ethiopia requires in-depth research to improve
   our understanding of the unintended negative effects of projects and to
   guide the location, design, and implementation of appropriate preventive
   and remedial programs.}},

Title = {{Adaptive maternal plasticity in response to perceptions of larval
   competition}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Because the developmental performance of a genotype can vary
   substantially depending on the conditions to which it is exposed,
   mothers are known to exercise strong choice concerning oviposition
   sites. Females potentially adjust the provisioning or paternity of
   offspring by responding to multiple environmental factors, but how those
   factors interact in the context of female assessment has been under
   investigated and remains poorly understood.
   In this study, we examine how female perceptions of the larval
   environment affect the size, fitness and paternity of her brood. We
   mated female yellow dung flies, Scathophaga stercoraria, with two
   different males each, manipulated female perception of larval
   competition levels, and subsequently split clutches across high and
   low-competition conditions.
   We found that females (especially large females) laid more eggs when
   they perceived low levels of competition for their brood. Females
   further adjusted brood size depending on the size of their last mate
   (who typically sires most offspring), increasing brood size for large
   second mates when perceiving low levels of competition, and for small
   second mates when they perceived competition to be high. Larval survival
   was highest for females who perceived the same larval conditions that
   their larvae experienced, and whose last mate was well suited to such
   conditions (e.g. small for competitive conditions, or large in the
   absence of competition). In contrast, the effects of competition on
   paternity did not depend on maternal perceptions of larval competition,
   as would be expected if females exercise adaptive cryptic choice to
   favour alternate male phenotypes depending on the intensity of larval
   competition.
   Our experimental approach supports complex and sophisticated changes in
   female behaviour in response to cues of larval fitness. Our results
   further emphasize that most plasticity in maternal behaviour serves to
   improve larval fitness directly, providing valuable empirical support
   for theoretical assertions of the primacy of material benefits over
   good-genes.}},

Abstract = {{In the Western Alps, two subspecies of Saussurea alpina are found in a
   partly overlapping distribution area; however, they prefer distinct
   habitats. While Saussurea alpina ssp. alpina is distributed throughout
   the Alps and beyond, S. alpina ssp. depressa is endemic to the region
   ranging from the Maritime Alps (France) to the Valais (Switzerland). The
   sympatric occurrence of closely related taxa raises general questions
   which factors drive speciation. In order to investigate the genetic and
   ecological differentiation of the two subspecies, we applied Amplified
   Fragment Length Polymorphisms and analyzed the habitat preferences via
   soil pH measurements and vegetation relev,s. Overall, we studied 12
   populations (five populations of S. alpina ssp. alpina and seven of S.
   alpina ssp. depressa). The populations were found to be genetically
   highly differentiated (F (ST) = 0.42). Nevertheless, a weak, but
   significant genetic differentiation between the subspecies could be
   detected (F (CT) = 0.04) and the results of the ecological analyses
   showed a clear differentiation in habitat types. While S. alpina ssp.
   alpina occurs in alpine grasslands, S. alpina ssp. depressa occurs
   mainly on calcareous scree with a significantly higher soil pH (median
   pH = 7 and median of pH = 8.14 for S. alpina ssp. alpina and S. alpina
   ssp. depressa, respectively) and different surrounding vegetation. We
   conclude from the clear difference in ecology that ecological plant
   speciation is a major factor in establishing and maintaining a
   reproductive barrier. We explain the weak genetic differentiation with a
   recent separation of the two evolutionary units during the last
   glaciation cycles or even in postglacial periods.}},

Abstract = {{The trade-off between reproductive investment in early versus late life
   is central to life-history theory. Despite abundant empirical evidence
   supporting different versions of this trade-off, the specific trade-off
   between age at first reproduction (AFR) and age at last reproduction
   (ALR) has received little attention, especially in long-lived species
   with a pronounced reproductive senescence such as humans. Using
   genealogical data for a 19th-century Swiss village, we (i) quantify
   natural selection acting on reproductive timing, (ii) estimate the
   underlying additive genetic (co)variances, and (iii) use these to
   predict evolutionary responses. Selection gradients were computed using
   multiple linear regression, and the additive genetic variance-covariance
   matrix was estimated using a restricted maximum-likelihood animal model.
   We found strong selection for both an early AFR and a late ALR, which
   resulted from selection for an earlier and longer reproductive period
   (RP, i.e., ALR-AFR). Furthermore, postponing AFR shortened RP in both
   sexes, but twice as much in women. Finally, AFR and ALR were strongly
   and positively genetically correlated, which led to a considerable
   reduction in the predicted responses to selection, or even rendered them
   maladaptive. These results provide evidence for strong genetic
   constraints underlying reproductive timing in humans, which may have
   contributed to the evolution of menopause.}},

Abstract = {{The APEX airborne imaging spectrometer has been shown to exhibit
   spectral shifts during in-flight conditions, linked to changes in the
   nitrogen gas density within the APEX optical subunit. These shifts lead
   to features in the recorded spectra caused by the dichroic coating used
   as a beam splitter between VNIR and SWIR channels. Consequently dichroic
   features are no longer compensated for by the radiometric calibration
   coefficients obtained under laboratory conditions. This paper presents
   results of a numerical simulation that can model the impact of spectral
   shifts on radiometry. As a consequence the APEX sensor model has been
   upgraded and according correction functions have been implemented in the
   APEX level 1 processor to compensate for shift dependent changes in
   radiometry due to the dichroic coating.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionThe mountains of NW North America are home to natural meadows
   that cover large areas at the timberline. The vegetation of these
   meadows has been the topic of few local studies, and little is known of
   species composition turnover across mountain ranges and along the
   latitudinal gradient. We sampled and analyzed community composition
   along a 1000-km gradient to answer the following questions: (1) what are
   the main community types in timberline meadows; (2) what are the most
   important abiotic gradients underlying their composition; and (3) how is
   species diversity related to environmental factors and how does it
   change along the latitudinal gradient?
   LocationSE and central British Columbia (Canada), NW Montana (USA).
   MethodsWe recorded data on cover and presence/absence of vascular plant,
   bryophyte and lichen species, as well as structure and environmental
   properties in 4mx4 m plots (n=112). Using the OptimClass approach, we
   classified plots into distinct community types. We used NMDS and
   multiple regressions to analyse the relationship between composition,
   species richness and environmental and geographic gradients.
   ResultsDespite drawing from a large geographic area, our classification
   revealed only four meadow communities. Mesic meadows were the most
   frequent and had a pronounced species turnover along latitude, resulting
   in two distinct community types. In addition, a three-dimensional
   ordination showed that vegetation structural properties, macroclimate
   and geographic predictors were important underlying gradients for
   species composition. Vascular species richness increased with soil pH,
   and exhibited a quadratic relationship with litter cover and latitude.
   Furthermore, in the latter case, it increased towards the southern and
   northern ends of our gradient.
   ConclusionsDetection of only four meadow communities along the 1000-km
   sampling gradient suggests a relatively recently established flora and a
   lack of regional differentiation consistent with the low level of
   endemism in the region. Higher vascular species diversity at the
   northern and southern edges of our gradient may reflect the geographic
   proximity to areas unglaciated during the Pleistocene, and suggests that
   areas farthest from the unglaciated edge may be experiencing
   colonization debt.}},

   questionnaire to assess initial subjective experiences of cigarette
   smoking. However, its factor structure is not clearly defined and can be
   perceived from two main standpoints: valence, or positive and negative
   experiences, and sensitivity to nicotine. This article explores the
   ESE's factor structure and determines which standpoint was more
   relevant. It compares two groups of young Swiss men (German- and
   French-speaking). We examined baseline data on 3,368 tobacco users from
   a representative sample in the ongoing Cohort Study on Substance Use
   Risk Factors (C-SURF). ESE, continued tobacco use, weekly smoking and
   nicotine dependence were assessed. Exploratory structural equation
   modeling (ESEM) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were performed.
   ESEM clearly distinguished positive experiences from negative
   experiences, but negative experiences were divided in experiences
   related to dizziness and experiences related to irritations. SEM
   underlined the reinforcing effects of positive experiences, but also of
   experiences related to dizziness on nicotine dependence and weekly
   smoking. The best ESE structure for predictive accuracy of experiences
   on smoking behavior was a compromise between the valence and sensitivity
   standpoints, which showed clinical relevance.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of TaS3 as a potential susceptibility gene encoding a
   protein homologous to ULP1 protease in wheat, which may regulate SUMO
   function facilitating powdery mildew attack.
   Some plant genes that are required for susceptibilities to certain
   pathogens are known as susceptibility genes or susceptibility factors,
   whose loss-of-function mutations can confer the plants resistances. To
   identify potential susceptibility genes to powdery mildew in wheat,
   differentially expressed genes in compatible and incompatible
   interactions between wheat and powdery mildew were examined by the cDNA
   chip assay. The genes exclusively expressed in the susceptible cultivar
   were interfered using biolistic transient transformation in wheat
   epidermal cells. The suppression of gene TaS3 (Triticum aestivum
   susceptibility) decreased the pathogen penetration by 19 \%, and its
   over-expression increased the disease susceptibility. The deduced
   protein from TaS3 belongs to the putative ubiquitin-like protease 1
   peptidase domain family. Subcellular localization studies revealed that
   its protein was accumulated in the nucleus. Quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that TaS3 transcript was
   significantly induced in the compatible host. This suggests that TaS3 is
   a potential susceptible gene and its function may be related to regulate
   SUMO functions.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the context of road construction, modern earthwork compaction rollers
   equipped with sensors collect a virtually continuous flow of soil
   property measurements. This sequential, spatial data can be utilized to
   improve the quality control of the compaction process through the
   introduction of intelligent compaction. These roller measurement values
   are observed indirectly through non-linear measurement operators,
   non-stationary, inherently multivariate with complex correlation
   structures, and collected in huge quantities. The problem of modeling
   and estimation in a spatially correlated setting with large amounts of
   data is well known and many approaches can be found in the literature.
   Very few studies have been completed investigating sequential, spatially
   correlated data outside of a point process framework. We propose a
   sequential, spatial mixed-effects model and develop a sequential,
   spatial back-fitting algorithm to estimate fixed effects and several
   independent, spatially correlated processes. This new algorithm is
   demonstrated in a simulation study and applied to earthwork compaction
   data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes the effectiveness and efficiency of the two
   principal United Nations (UN) climate change mitigation finance
   mechanisms, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the Global
   Environment Facility (GEF). The realised abatement and costs of the two
   mechanisms in India and Brazil (using data from 28 GEF and 233 CDM
   project documents) are compared with theoretical marginal abatement cost
   curves, based on bottom-up technology studies. We find that both
   mechanisms have focused on negative and low-cost abatement potential but
   still leave substantial theoretical potential in this cost range
   untapped. CDM has more effectively harvested abatement potential of
   industrial gases and methane emissions, whereas GEF has more
   successfully targeted demand-side energy efficiency (EE) and transport
   emission reduction opportunities. CDM has excelled at capturing
   abatement potential in areas with a limited understanding of abatement,
   highlighting the shortcomings of theoretical estimates (such as Marginal
   Abatement Cost Curves) and the benefits of a market mechanism. In some
   sectors and technologies (particularly renewable energy), the two
   mechanisms overlapped, which suggests a need for better coordination in
   the future.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing debate on the use of transgenic crops in agriculture and its
   possible ecological consequences is well into its third decade. Within
   this debate, three moral positions can be identified that rest upon
   different theories of normative ethics: a consequentialist, a

   be fully resolved, a closer examination of the functions of the
   different moral positions is warranted in order to find constructive
   approaches for managing the controversy. Such an examination could
   contribute to a more objective debate on the use of transgenic crops. As
   a first step to achieve this goal the author develops criteria for
   ethical decision-making that integrate the different moral positions.}},

   flow simulations}},
Journal = {{GEOMORPHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Mass flow simulations are considered important tools for hazard
   analysis. For the simulation of single process mass flows such as debris
   flows, robust tools and reasonable parameter range estimates are
   available. However, this is much less the case for more complex mass
   flows, e.g. involving process chains and flow transformation. We explore
   the challenges of simulating complex flow-dominated landslides by
   back-calculating the Huascaran events of 1962 and 1970 with r.avaflow, a
   two-phase mass flow model (Pudasaini, 2012) in a GIS-based open source
   simulation framework. Both events started as rock-ice falls on the
   western slope of the north summit of Nevado Huascaran (Cordillera
   Blanca, Peru) and entrained large volumes of glacial till at lower
   elevation, resulting in highly mobile debris avalanches. Whereas the
   1962 event badly affected the village of Ranrahirca when spreading over
   a debris cone, the 1970 event overtopped a ridge and led to the complete
   destruction of the town of Yungay. Well documented in the literature,
   these events provide an opportunity as a natural laboratory for testing
   innovative mass flow simulation tools and their features. In a first
   step, we consider (i) the 1962 event and (ii) the 1970 event separately,
   for each of them optimizing the key input parameters in terms of
   empirical adequacy. In a second step, we apply the optimized parameter
   set for (i) to the 1970 event and the parameter set derived for (ii) to
   the 1962 event. In a third step, we explore the sensitivity of the model
   outcomes to selected key parameters (basal friction angle and
   entrainment coefficient). The results (a) demonstrate the general
   ability of r.avaflow to reproduce the spatio-temporal evolution of flow
   heights and velocities as well as travel times and volumes of these
   complex mass flow events reasonably well; and (b) highlight the
   challenges and uncertainties involved in predictive simulations with
   parameter sets obtained from back-calculations. We suggest a strategy to
   appropriately deal with uncertain outcomes by superimposing the results
   of multiple simulations. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Environmental assessment of alternative methanesulfonic acid production
   using direct activation of methane}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{202}},
Pages = {{1179-1191}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a comparative life cycle assessment of two
   processes for the industrial production of methansulfonic acid. The
   conventional multi-step process for the production of methansulfonic
   acid is based on the reaction of methanol and hydrogen sulfide to form
   methanthiol which is used to produce dimethyldisulfate. The
   dimethyldisulfate reacts further with nitric acid to form
   methanesulfonic acid. A newly developed process presents the possibility
   to form methanesulfonic acid directly from methane and sulfur trioxide
   in a single step at mild conditions. Thus this process enables for the
   first time the production of a high value chemical through direct
   activation of methane on an industrial scale. The cradle-to-gate life
   cycle assessment conducted with the ReCiPe Method revealed that this
   direct process has a total environmental impact that is 3 times lower
   than that of the conventional process. The differences resulted from
   lower energy requirements and alternative reactants used in the direct
   process. The results therefore demonstrate the potential for methane
   extracted from natural gas as a greener alternative to oil as a chemical
   feedstock in the medium term. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Comparative effects of the parasiticide ivermectin on survival and

Journal = {{ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{215-222}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Ivermectin is a veterinary pharmaceutical widely applied against
   parasites of livestock. Being effective against pests, it is also known
   to have lethal and sublethal effects on non-target organisms. While
   considerable research demonstrates the impact of ivermectin residues in
   livestock dung on the development and survival of dung feeding insect
   larvae, surprisingly little is known about its fitness effects on
   adults. We tested the impact of ivermectin on the survival of adult
   sepsid dung fly species (Diptera: Sepsidae) in the laboratory, using an
   ecologically relevant and realistic range of 69-1978 mu g ivermectin/kg
   wet dung, and compared the sensitivities of larvae and adults in a
   phylogenetic framework. For one representative, relatively insensitive
   species, Sepsis punctum, we further investigated effects of ivermectin
   on female fecundity and male fertility. Moreover, we tested whether
   females can differentiate between ivermectin-spiked and non-contaminated
   dung in the wild. Adult sepsid flies exposed to ivermectin suffered
   increased mortality, whereby closely related species varied strongly in
   their sensitivity. Adult susceptibility to the drug correlated with
   larval susceptibility, showing a phylogenetic signal and demonstrating
   systemic variation in ivermectin sensitivity. Exposure of S. puncturn
   females to even low concentrations of ivermectin lowered the number of
   eggs laid, while treatment of males reduced egg-to-adult offspring
   survival, presumably via impairment of sperm quality or quantity. The
   fitness impact was amplified when both parents were exposed. Lastly,
   sepsid flies did not discriminate against ivermectin-spiked dung in the
   field. Treatment of livestock with avermectins may thus have even more
   far-reaching sublethal ecological consequences than currently assumed
   via effects on adult dung-feeding insects.}},

Title = {{Both woody and herbaceous semi-natural habitats are essential for spider

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{267}},
Pages = {{141-146}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Semi-natural habitats (SNH) support biodiversity and associated
   ecosystem services on farmland, thereby contributing to sustainable
   agriculture. However, little is known about the specific suitability of
   different types of SNH as overwintering habitat for predatory
   arthropods, despite the crucial role of such knowledge for conservation
   biological control. We used ground photoeclectors to sample spiders in
   65 habitats comprising crop fields and four major SNH types (herbaceous
   areal, herbaceous linear, woody areal, woody linear) across two study
   regions in Switzerland and Germany to identify the most important
   overwintering habitats for spiders. Spider emergence started in February
   and over half of the individuals of the most common spiders had already
   emerged by late April. SNH supported on average 146\% higher species
   richness and 194\% higher densities of spiders than crop fields. Woody
   and herbaceous SNH supported distinct spider communities, with
   individual species exhibiting marked preferences for either woody or
   herbaceous SNH. Habitat shape (areal or linear) had no significant
   effects on spider overwintering. Woody SNH hosted more species, whereas
   herbaceous SNH had higher densities of agrobiont species (i.e. species
   known to reach high densities in crops in the growing season). Given the
   higher number of overwintering agrobionts in herbaceous SNH, this
   habitat type has potential to promote pest control by spill-over of
   spiders into nearby crops early in the season. In contrast, woody SNH
   seem to be more important for the conservation of diverse spider
   communities that are highly distinct from those inhabiting open land.
   Hence, creating and preserving a variety of SNH is key to provide
   suitable overwintering sites for species in agricultural landscapes.}},

   questionnaire. Participants were 18 years of age or older (16 years of
   age or older in Zurich) and lived, worked and/or studied in one of the
   case-study cities. Associations between transport mode use and
   health/social contact measures were estimated using mixed-effects
   logistic regression models, linear regression models, and logistic
   regression models according to the data available. All the associations
   were assessed with single and multiple transport mode models. All models
   were adjusted for potential confounders.
   Results: In multiple transport mode models, bicycle use was associated
   with good self-perceived health {[}OR (CI 95\%) = 1.07 (1.05, 1.08)],
   all the mental health measures {[}perceived stress: coef (CI 95\%)=
   -0.016 (-0.028, -0.004); mental health: coef (CI 95\%) = 0.11 (0.05,
   0.18); vitality: coef (CI 95\%) = 0.14 (0.07, 0.22)], and with fewer
   feelings of loneliness {[}coef (CI 95\%) = -0.03 (-0.05, -0.01)].
   Walking was associated with good self-perceived health {[}OR (CI 95\%) =
   1.02 (1.00, 1.03)], higher vitality {[}coef (CI 95\%) = 0.14 (0.05,
   0.23)], and more frequent contact with friends/family {[}OR (CI 95\%)=
   1.03 (1.00, 1.05)]. Car use was associated with fewer feelings of
   loneliness {[}coef (CI 95\%) =-0.04 (-0.06, -0.02)]. The results for
   e-bike and public transport use were non-significant, and the results
   for motorbike use were inconclusive.
   Conclusions: Similarity of findings across cities suggested that active
   transport, especially bicycle use, should be encouraged to improve
   population health and social outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Associating a radar scatterer to a physical object is crucial for the
   correct interpretation of interferometric synthetic aperture radar
   measurements. Yet, especially for medium-resolution imagery, this is
   notoriously difficult and dependent on the accurate 3-D positioning of
   the scatterers. Here, we investigate the 3-D positioning capabilities of
   ENVISAT medium-resolution data. We find that the data are perturbed by
   range-and-epoch-dependent timing errors and calibration offsets.
   Calibration offsets are estimated to be about 1.58 m in azimuth and 2.84
   m in range and should be added to ASAR products to improve geometric
   calibration. The timing errors involve a bistatic offset, atmospheric
   path delay, solid earth tides, and local oscillator drift. This way, we
   achieve an unbiased positioning capability in 2-D, while in 3-D, a
   scatterer was located at a distance of 28 cm from the true location. 3-D
   precision is now expressed as an error ellipsoid in local coordinates.
   Using the Bhattacharyya metric, we associate radar scatterers to
   real-world objects. Interpreting deformation of individual
   infrastructure is shown to be feasible for this type of
   medium-resolution data.}},

Abstract = {{Research on mycorrhizal interactions has traditionally developed into
   separate disciplines addressing different organizational levels. This
   separation has led to an incomplete understanding of mycorrhizal
   functioning. Integration of mycorrhiza research at different scales is
   needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the context dependency of
   mycorrhizal associations, and to use mycorrhizae for solving
   environmental issues. Here, we provide a road map for the integration of
   mycorrhiza research into a unique framework that spans genes to
   ecosystems. Using two key topics, we identify parallels in mycorrhiza
   research at different organizational levels. Based on two current
   projects, we show how scientific integration creates synergies, and
   discuss future directions. Only by overcoming disciplinary boundaries,
   we will achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the functioning of
   mycorrhizal associations.}},

Abstract = {{Despite irrefutable evidence of its negative impact on animal behaviour
   and physiology, lethal and sublethal lead poisoning of wildlife is still
   persistent and widespread. For scavenging birds, ingestion of
   ammunition, or fragments thereof, is the major exposure route. In this
   study, we examined the occurrence of lead in four avian scavengers of
   Switzerland and how it differs between species, regions, and age of the
   bird. We measured lead concentration in liver and bone of the two main
   alpine avian scavengers (golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos and bearded
   vulture Gypaetus barbatus) over the entire area of the Swiss Alps and
   two of the main avian scavengers occurring in the lowlands of
   Switzerland (red kite Milvus milvus and common raven Corvus corax). Of
   those four species, only the bearded vulture is an obligate scavenger.
   We found that lead burdens in the two alpine avian scavengers were
   higher than those found for the same species elsewhere in Europe or
   North America and reached levels compatible with acute poisoning,
   whereas lead burdens of the two lowland avian scavengers seemed to be
   lower. Several golden eagles, but only one red kite with abnormally high
   bone lead concentrations were found. In all four species, a substantial
   proportion of birds had elevated levels which presumably represent
   recent (liver lead levels) or past (bone lead levels) uptake of
   sublethal doses of lead.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the history of cinema, water has beenand still isomnipresent
   in various forms. The relationship between water and moving images
   extends to multiple levels. First and foremost, there are interesting
   theoretical implications: Water and the ways it can be perceived pose an
   apt analogy to conceptualize how the sensual relationship between moving
   images and the viewer can be understood. This approach is based on the
   analysis of aesthetical forms that stage water and expose fluidity in
   moving images. The study of numerous film examplesas well as of some
   recent music videosshows that the dissolution of stable distinctions
   between what is perceived as reality and what as a dream becomes
   crucial: the transitions become literally fluid within the images. This
   leads to the investigation of how films position the human subject in
   relation to unreliable, fluid mirrors. Moreover, the human body can also
   be shown as fully immersed in liquid spaces. Such floating bodies are
   often staged within specific settings such as swimming pools or
   aquariums. As an extreme existential form, the drowned body plays a
   significant role in cultural history. Finally, the discussion of the
   physical and tactile experience in aquatic surroundings and cinema's
   voyeurism leads to the topic of eroticism. The potential of audio-visual
   images to convey the experience of fluidity of time and space is pivotal
   for the specific imaginary and for the sensual and corporal perception
   mode in which we not only see but actually feel films. This article is
   categorized under:

Abstract = {{Floodplain areas belong to the most diverse, dynamic and complex
   ecological habitats of the terrestrial portion of the Earth. Spatial and
   temporal quantification of floodplain dynamics is needed for assessing
   the impacts of hydromorphological controls on river ecosystems. However,
   estimation of land cover dynamics in a post-classification setting is
   hindered by a high contribution of classification errors. A possible
   solution relies on the selection of specific information of the change
   map, instead of increasing the overall classification accuracy. In this
   study, we analyze the capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), the
   associated classification processes and their respective accuracies to
   extract a robust estimate of floodplain dynamics. We show that an
   estimation of dynamics should be built on specific land cover interfaces
   to be robust against classification errors and should include specific
   features depending on the season-sensor coupling. We use five different
   sets of features and determine the optimal combination to use
   information largely based on blue and infrared bands with the support of
   texture and point cloud metrics at leaf-off conditions. In this
   post-classification setting, the best observation of dynamics can be
   achieved by focusing on the gravel-water interface. The semi-supervised
   approach generated error of 10\% of observed changes along highly
   dynamic reaches using these two land cover classes. The results show
   that a robust quantification of floodplain land cover dynamics can be
   achieved by high-resolution remote sensing.}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which plants can reduce nutrient concentrations in soil
   and thereby compete with others may increase with nutrient mobility.
   Hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can extend the soil volume
   from which plants acquire phosphorus (P), thus increasing competition
   for these resources with neighbours. In this study, we tested whether
   the suppression of hyphal interconnections between neighbour plants
   mitigates their competitive interactions and consequently affects plant
   community structure. We used custom-built microcosms that used a wire
   system to suppress the development of a common mycorrhizal network (CMN)
   between plant neighbours. We applied this CMN treatment to plants
   without neighbours (competition-free controls), with conspecific
   neighbours (monocultures) or with heterospecific neighbours (two and
   four species communities), all assembled from two pools of four separate
   temperate grassland species each. We analysed changes in species and
   community-level productivity and P acquisition. The CMN treatment
   affected species differently. Most species had reduced shoot biomass
   while root biomass increased with CMN disconnection. Productivity and
   nutrient acquisition of Plantago lanceolata in four-species mixtures was
   negatively affected, leading to a less even distribution of P among
   species, but community-level P acquisition was not affected. On average,
   two-species and four-species mixtures produced similar community biomass
   and had the same P content as monocultures.Synthesis. Common mycorrhizal
   network disconnection affected competitive interactions among species
   only little. One explanation may be that the absence of pronounced
   competitive hierarchy among the species investigated led to relatively
   symmetric interactions among species that were stable with respects to
   additional common mycorrhizal network effects. Another explanation is
   that common mycorrhizal network effects are less important in natural
   soils with natural arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities than
   experiments with few arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi strains and often
   sterilized soils suggest.}},

Abstract = {{Population dynamics are the result of an interplay between extrinsic and
   intrinsic environmental drivers. Predicting the effects of environmental
   change on wildlife populations therefore requires a thorough
   understanding of the mechanisms through which different environmental
   drivers interact to generate changes in population size and structure.
   In this study, we disentangled the roles of temperature, food
   availability and population density in shaping short- and long-term
   population dynamics of the African striped mouse, a small rodent
   inhabiting a semidesert with high intra- and interannual variation in
   environmental conditions. We parameterized a female-only
   stage-structured matrix population model with vital rates depending on
   temperature, food availability and population density, using monthly
   mark-recapture data from 1609 mice trapped over 9years (2005-2014). We
   then applied perturbation analyses to determine relative strengths and
   demographic pathways of these drivers in affecting population dynamics.
   Furthermore, we used stochastic population projections to gain insights
   into how three different climate change scenarios might affect size,
   structure and persistence of this population. We identified food
   availability, acting through reproduction, as the main driver of changes
   in both short- and long-term population dynamics. This mechanism was
   mediated by strong density feedbacks, which stabilized the population
   after high peaks and allowed it to recover from detrimental crashes.
   Density dependence thus buffered the population against environmental
   change, and even adverse climate change scenarios were predicted to have
   little effect on population persistence (extinction risk over 100years
   <5\%) despite leading to overall lower abundances. Explicitly linking
   environment-demography relationships to population dynamics allowed us
   to accurately capture past population dynamics. It further enabled
   establishing the roles and relative importances of extrinsic and
   intrinsic environmental drivers, and we conclude that doing this is
   essential when investigating impacts of climate change on wildlife
   populations.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{More frequent and severe El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO) are
   causing episodic periods of decreased rainfall. Although the effects of
   these ENSO-induced droughts on tree growth and mortality have been well
   studied, the impacts on other demographic rates such as reproduction are
   less well known. We use a four-year seed rain dataset encompassing the
   most severe ENSO-induced drought in more than 30 years to assess the
   resilience (i.e., resistance and recovery) of the seed composition and
   abundance of three forest types in a tropical dry forest. We found that
   forest types showed distinct differences in the timing, duration, and
   intensity of drought during the ENSO event, which likely mediated seed
   composition shifts and resilience. Drought-deciduous species were
   particularly sensitive to the drought with overall poor resilience of
   seed production, whereby seed abundance of this functional group failed
   to recover to predrought levels even two years after the drought. Liana
   and wind-dispersed species were able to maintain seed production both
   during and after drought, suggesting that ENSO events promote early
   successional species or species with a colonization strategy. Combined,
   these results suggest that ENSO-induced drought mediates the
   establishment of functional groups and dispersal types suited for early
   successional conditions with more open canopies and reduced competition
   among plants. The effects of the ENSO-induced drought on seed
   composition and abundance were still evident two years after the event
   suggesting the recovery of seed production requires multiple years that
   may lead to shifts in forest composition and structure in the long term,
   with potential consequences for higher trophic levels like frugivores.}},

Abstract = {{In Peru landslides have been causing damages and casualties annually due
   to the high mountain relief and distinct seasonal precipitation
   distribution. Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry
   represents one possibility for mapping surface deformation at fine
   spatial resolution over large areas in order to characterize aspects of
   terrain motion and potentially hazardous processes. We present land
   surface motion maps derived from satellite SAR interferometry (InSAR)
   for a part of the Santa River Basin between the Cordilleras Blanca and
   Negra around the city of Carhuaz in Peru. Using both Persistent
   Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and differential SAR Interferograms
   (DInSAR) from ALOS-1 PALSAR-1, ENVISAT ASAR, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and
   Sentinel-1 we mapped 42 landslides extending over 17,190,141 m(2) within
   three classes of activity (i.e. 0-2 cm/a, 2-10 cm/a and > 10 cm/a). A
   geomorphological inventory of landslides was prepared from optical
   satellite imagery and field experience and compared to the InSAR-based
   slope-instability inventory. The two approaches provide slightly
   different information about landslide spatial and temporal activity
   patterns, but altogether they can be combined for the assessment of the
   state of activity of landslides and possibly the development of hazard
   maps, which are not systematically available in this region. We conclude
   that ALOS PALSAR (1 and 2) and Sentinel-1 data have a high potential to
   derive high-quality surface deformation information of landslides in
   many mountainous regions worldwide due to their global and frequent
   acquisition strategies.}},

Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3333-3353}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Instability and failure of high mountain rock slopes have significantly
   increased since the 1990s coincident with climatic warming and are
   expected to rise further. Most of the observed failures in
   permafrost-affected rock walls are likely triggered by the mechanical
   destabilisation of warming bedrock permafrost including ice-filled
   joints. The failure of ice-filled rock joints has only been observed in
   a small number of experiments, often using concrete as a rock analogue.
   Here, we present a systematic study of the brittle shear failure of ice
   and rock-ice interfaces, simulating the accelerating phase of rock slope
   failure. For this, we performed 141 shearing experiments with
   rock-ice-rock ``sandwich{''}' samples at constant strain rates (10(3)
   s(-1)) provoking ice fracturing, under normal stress conditions ranging
   from 100 to 800 kPa, representing 4-30m of rock overburden, and at
   temperatures from -10 to -0.5 degrees C, typical for recent observed
   rock slope failures in alpine permafrost. To create close to natural but
   reproducible conditions, limestone sample surfaces were ground to
   international rock mechanical standard roughness. Acoustic emission
   (Lambda E) was successfully applied to describe the fracturing
   behaviour, anticipating rock-ice failure as all failures are predated by
   an AE hit increase with peaks immediately prior to failure. We
   demonstrate that both the warming and unloading (i.e. reduced
   overburden) of ice-filled rock joints lead to a significant drop in
   shear resistance. With a temperature increase from -10 to -0.5 degrees
   C, the shear stress at failure reduces by 64 \%-78\% for normal stresses
   of 100-400 kPa. At a given temperature, the shear resistance of rock-ice
   interfaces decreases with decreasing normal stress. This can lead to a
   self-enforced rock slope failure propagation: as soon as a first slab
   has detached, further slabs become unstable through progressive thermal
   propagation and possibly even faster by unloading. Here, we introduce a
   new Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for ice-filled rock joints that is
   valid for joint surfaces, which we assume similar for all rock types,
   and which applies to temperatures from -8 to -0.5 degrees C and normal
   stresses from 100 to 400 kPa. It contains temperature-dependent friction
   and cohesion, which decrease by 12\% degrees C-1 and 10\% degrees C-1
   respectively due to warming and it applies to temperature and stress
   conditions of more than 90\% of the recently documented accelerating
   failure phases in permafrost rock walls.}},

Abstract = {{Greenland's peripheral glaciers and ice caps are key indicators of
   climate change in the Arctic, but quantitative observational data of
   their recent evolution are sparse. Three recently released
   high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs)-AeroDEM (based on images
   from 1978 to 1987), ArcticDEM (2012-2015), and TanDEM-X
   (2010-2014)-provide the possibility to calculate elevation changes
   spanning almost four decades along the margins of the Greenland Ice
   Sheet. This study explores the potential of these DEMs by calculating
   elevation changes for the Holm Land Ice Cap (865 km(2)), northeast
   Greenland. Co-registration indicated no significant shifts between the
   DEMs but we encountered localized vertical offsets in AeroDEM. The data
   quality of ArcticDEM and TanDEM-X is high, but AeroDEM suffers from 19
   percent low-quality data, which were treated as data voids. Applying two
   approaches to fill the data voids in the difference grid between
   ArcticDEM and AeroDEM, mean surface-elevation change over the Holm Land
   Ice Cap and a period of approximately 35 y is in the range of -8.30 +/-
   0.30 m. Comparing ArcticDEM and TanDEM-X reveals a glacier elevation
   difference of 2.54 m, which may be partly related to the different
   retrieval techniques (optical and SAR). Overall, the DEMs have good
   potential for large-scale and long-term assessment of geodetic glacier
   mass balance.}},

Abstract = {{For many polar organic micropollutants, biotransformation by activated
   sludge microorganisms is a major removal process during wastewater
   treatment. However, our current understanding of how wastewater
   treatment operations influence microbial communities and their
   micropollutant biotransformation potential is limited, leaving major
   parts of observed variability in biotransformation rates across
   treatment facilities unexplained. Here, we present biotransformation
   rate constants for 42 micropollutants belonging to different chemical
   classes along a gradient of solids retention time (SRT). The geometric
   mean of biomass-normalized first-order rate constants shows a clear
   increase between 3 and 15 d SRT by 160\% and 87\%, respectively, in two
   experiments. However, individual micropollutants show a variety of
   trends. Rate constants of oxidative biotransformation reactions mostly
   increased with SRT. Yet, nitrifying activity could be excluded as
   primary driver. For substances undergoing other than oxidative
   reactions, i.e., mostly substitution-type reactions, more diverse
   dependencies on SRT were observed. Most remarkably, characteristic
   trends were observed for groups of substances undergoing similar types
   of initial transformation reaction, suggesting that shared enzymes or
   enzyme systems that are conjointly regulated catalyze biotransformation
   reactions within such groups. These findings open up opportunities for
   correlating rate constants with measures of enzyme abundance such as
   genes or gene products, which in turn should help to identify enzymes
   associated with the respective biotransformation reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Rivers are among the most threatened freshwater ecosystems, and
   anthropogenic activities are affecting both river structures and water
   quality. While assessing the organisms can provide a comprehensive
   measure of a river's ecological status, it is limited by the traditional
   morphotaxonomy-based biomonitoring. Recent advances in environmental DNA
   (eDNA) metabarcoding allow to identify prokaryotes and eukaryotes in one
   sequencing run, and could thus allow unprecedented resolution. Whether
   such eDNA-based data can be used directly to predict the pollution
   status of rivers as a complementation of environmental data remains
   unknown. Here we used eDNA metabarcoding to explore the main stressors
   of rivers along which community structure changes, and to identify the
   method's potential for predicting pollution status based on eDNA data.
   We showed that a broad range of taxa in bacterial, protistan, and
   metazoan communities could be profiled with eDNA. Nutrients were the
   main driving stressor affecting communities' structure, alpha diversity,
   and the ecological network. We specifically observed that the relative
   abundance of indicative OTUs was significantly correlated with nutrient
   levels. These OTUs data could be used to predict the nutrient status up
   to 79\% accuracy on testing data sets. Thus, our study gives a novel
   approach to predicting the pollution status of rivers by eDNA data.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{639}},
Pages = {{961-976}},

Abstract = {{Streamflow projections are fundamental sources for future water
   resources strategic planning and management, particularly in
   high-altitude scarcely-gauged basins located in high mountain Asia.
   Therefore, quantification of the climate change impacts on major
   hydrological components (evapotranspiration, soil water storage,
   snowmelt-runoff, rainfall-runoff and streamflow) is of high importance
   and remains a challenge. For this purpose, we analysed general
   circulation models (GCMs) using a multiple bias correction approach and
   two different hydrological models i.e. the Hydrological Modelling
   System(HEC-HMS) and the Snow melt Runoff Model (SRM), to examine the
   impact of climate change on the hydrological behaviour of the Jhelum
   River basin. Based on scrutiny, climate projections using four best fit
   CMIP5 GCMs (i.e. BCC-CSM1.1, INMCM4, IPSL-CM5A-LR and CMCC-CMS) were
   chosen by evaluating linear scaling, local intensity scaling (LOCI) and
   distribution mapping (DM) approaches at twenty climate stations.
   Subsequently, after calibration and validation of HEC-HMS and SRM at
   five streamflow gauging stations, the bias corrected projected climate
   data was integrated with HEC-HMS and SRM to simulate projected
   streamflow. Results demonstrate that the DM approach fitted the
   projections best. The climate projections exhibited maximum intra-annual
   rises in precipitation by 183.2 mm (12.74\%) during the mon-soon for
   RCP4.5 and a rise in T-min (T-max) by 4.77 degrees C (4.42 degrees C)
   during pre-monsoon, for RCP8.5 during 2090s. The precipitation and
   temperature rise is expected to expedite and increase snowmelt-runoff up
   to 48\% and evapotranspiration and soil water storage up to 45\%. The
   projections exhibited significant increases in streamflows by 330 m(3)/s
   (22.6\%) for HEC-HMS and 449 m(3)/s (30.7\%) for SRM during the
   pre-monfaf0000soon season by the 2090s under RCP8.5. Overall, our
   results reveal that the pre-monsoon season is potentially utmost
   affected under scenario-periods, and consequently, which has the
   potential to alter the precipitation and flow regime of the Jhelum River
   basin due to significant early snow- and glacier-melt. (c) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {{Impact of organic and conventional farming systems on wheat grain uptake
   and soil bioavailability of zinc and cadmium}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{639}},
Pages = {{608-616}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Zinc (Zn) deficiency is a widespread problem in human nutrition and
   wheat grains are a major source of Zn intake in large parts of the
   population. It remains unclear to what extent organic and conventional
   farming practices, differing in organic matter management, influence Zn
   availability and uptake by wheat grains. Factors leading to an increased
   Zn uptake may also increase the Cd uptake in wheat grains, which can be
   harmful for humans. Here, we investigated the effects of different
   farming practices on Zn and Cd concentrations in wheat grains and their
   relationships with total and available soil Zn and Cd concentrations,
   and other soil properties. In northern Switzerland, 28 farms were
   sampled including 11 organic farms with compost use, 10 organic farms
   without compost use, and 7 conventional farms without compost use. Soil
   organic matter was a key factor for soil Zn and especially Cd
   concentrations across all three farming systems. Total and available
   soil Cd concentrations as well as soil organic carbon concentration
   (SOC) were significantly higher on the organic farms with compost use
   than on the conventional farms. However, only the compost farms with
   livestock showed significantly higher grain Cd concentrations in
   comparison to conventional and organic farms without compost use,
   although a nested effect of cultivar within the system also had an
   influence. In contrast to Cd, the soil and grain Zn concentrations
   showed no significant farming system effect although there was a
   correlation between total soil Zn and SOC when all farms were pooled.
   Grain Zn was decoupled from soil Zn indicating that under agricultural
   field conditions the farming systems are a minor factor in increasing
   grain Zn. Our study suggests that the Zn and Cd soil and grain
   concentrations were mediated by a combination of on farm organic matter
   management, soil properties, cultivar, and livestock production. (C)

Title = {{Carrying a selfish genetic element predicts increased migration

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{285}},
Number = {{1888}},

Abstract = {{Life is built on cooperation between genes, which makes it vulnerable to
   parasitism. Selfish genetic elements that exploit this cooperation can
   achieve large fitness gains by increasing their transmission relative to
   the rest of the genome. This leads to counter-adaptations that generate
   unique selection pressures on the selfish genetic element. This arms
   race is similar to host-parasite coevolution, as some multi-host
   parasites alter the host's behaviour to increase the chance of
   transmission to the next host. Here, we ask if, similarly to these
   parasites, a selfish genetic element in house mice, the t haplotype,
   also manipulates host behaviour, specifically the host's migration
   propensity. Variants of the t that manipulate migration propensity could
   increase in fitness in a meta-population. We show that juvenile mice
   carrying the t haplotype were more likely to emigrate from and were more
   often found as migrants within a long-term free-living house mouse
   population. This result may have applied relevance as the t has been
   proposed as a basis for artificial gene drive systems for use in
   population control.}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Goji (fruits of Lycium barbarum L. and
   L. chinense Mill., Solanaceae) have been used as a traditional food and
   medicine for hundreds of years in Asian countries and are now consumed
   globally. Quality of herbal medicines is critical for safe use and has
   been shown to be affected by value chains.
   Aim of the study: Using a value chain (VC) framework, we aim at
   understanding the influence of different VC types on goji quality and
   revenue of stakeholders.
   Materials and methods: Participant observation and semi-structured
   interviews were conducted during five months of fieldwork in the main
   production areas in China with a total of 65 stakeholders. Quality of
   goji, behaviour and financial performance of stakeholders was documented
   and analysed for different VCs.
   Results: Ten different types of VCs were identified. VCs with vertical
   integration and horizontal collaboration were found to have a more
   coherent quality control and better goji quality as well as improved
   stakeholders' financial performance. Vertical integration at different
   levels was found for independent farmer-based VCs, horizontal
   collaboration was found in the cooperative-based VCs. Full vertically
   integrated VCs were found in large-scale production.
   Conclusions: Goji quality and stakeholders' revenues are linked with
   different types of VCs which mirror stakeholders' behaviour driven by
   target markets. Considering their positive influence on quality and
   revenues, well-developed vertically integrated value chains are likely
   to become more important in the near future.}},

Title = {{Early Wuchiapingian (Lopingian, late Permian) drowning event in the
   South China block suggests a late eruptive phase of Emeishan large
   Igneous Province}},

Abstract = {{Although the precise age and magnitude of the end-Guadalupian
   biodiversity crisis is still debated, this ``mass{''} extinction has
   been customarily linked with the onset of massive volcanism in the
   Emeishan Large Igneous Province (ELIP) in south China. The onset of ELIP
   eruptive activity at least partly coincides in time with episodes of
   regional subsidence interrupting the predominant regime of carbonate
   platforms during Capitanian times.
   Here, we present a strikingly similar but younger (early Wuchiapingian)
   subsidence episode from the Pingtang syncline in southern Guizhou,
   termed the Mapojiao Event. Shallow-marine, light-grey, thick-bedded
   bioclastic limestone of the Wuchiaping Formation (Unit A) are overlain
   by deep-marine radiolarian-sponge spicule, thin-bedded black limestone
   (Unit B). The latter is followed by volcaniclastic distal turbidites
   (Unit C). The base of the next overlying unit consists of cherry,
   nodular limestone (Unit D) rich in radiolarians and sponge spicules,
   whose respective abundances decline up-ward within a few meters.
   Concomitant replacement by a shallow marine benthic fauna documents the
   uplift that terminates the event. A total of five index species of
   Clarkina conodonts indicating an early Wuchiapingian age were obtained
   from Units A and B. Brachiopods of Wuchiapingian age were also
   documented in units A, B and D.
   Compilation of drowning events in the Guadalupian-Lopingian (G-L)
   interval suggests clustering into three episodes; 1: middle Capitanian,
   2: possibly latest Capitanian, 3: early Wuchiapingian. The first
   drowning event is overlain by ELIP volcanics in sections near the center
   of the volcanic province. In peripheral areas, the first drowning is
   intercalated within carbonate platforms (e.g. Maoershan). A second
   drowning event cannot be excluded close to G-L boundary but it is
   obscured by the unconformity associated with an eustatic regression and
   by ambiguous conodont age control. Overlying this unconformity, the
   Wangpo Shale, which contains ELIP-derived volcanic materials, rests on
   the first (e.g. in Chaotian) drowning event. The striking similarities
   of the facies architecture shared by the first and third drowning events
   suggest a similar driving mechanism. Hence, we propose that the Mapojiao
   Event represents the youngest, early Wuchiapingian, burst of ELIP
   eruptive activity. There is no one-to-one correlation between these
   episodes related to ELIP eruptive activity and extinction phases of
   marine clades. Only the end-Guadalupian extinction has been correlated
   with the first eruptive episode. In marked contrast, the newly
   discovered Mapojiao drowning episode occurred within a diversification
   phase, which undermines any causal relations between the younger phases
   of ELIP volcanism and additional extinctions.}},

Abstract = {{A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that biodiversity
   stabilizes ecosystem functioning over time in grassland ecosystems.
   However, the relative importance of different facets of biodiversity
   underlying the diversity-stability relationship remains unclear. Here we
   use data from 39 grassland biodiversity experiments and structural
   equation modelling to investigate the roles of species richness,
   phylogenetic diversity and both the diversity and community-weighted
   mean of functional traits representing the `fast-slow' leaf economics
   spectrum in driving the diversity-stability relationship. We found that
   high species richness and phylogenetic diversity stabilize biomass
   production via enhanced asynchrony in the performance of co-occurring
   species. Contrary to expectations, low phylogenetic diversity enhances
   ecosystem stability directly, albeit weakly. While the diversity of
   fast-slow functional traits has a weak effect on ecosystem stability,
   communities dominated by slow species enhance ecosystem stability by
   increasing mean biomass production relative to the standard deviation of
   biomass over time. Our in-depth, integrative assessment of factors
   influencing the diversity-stability relationship demonstrates a more
   multicausal relationship than has been previously acknowledged.}},

Abstract = {{Main conclusion Although the PAO/phyllobilin pathway of chlorophyll
   breakdown is active in grass leaf senescence,the abundance of
   phyllobilins is far below the amount of degraded chlorophyll.
   The yellowing of fully developed leaves is the most prominent visual
   symptom of plant senescence. Thereby, chlorophyll is degraded via the
   so-called pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO)/phyllobilin pathway to a
   species-specific set of phyllobilins, linear tetrapyrrolic products of
   chlorophyll breakdown. Here, we investigated the diversity and abundance
   of phyllobilins in cereal and forage crops, i.e. barley, rice, ryegrass,
   sorghum and wheat, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A
   total of thirteen phyllobilins were identified, among them four novel,
   not yet described ones, pointing to a rather high diversity of
   phyllobilin-modifying activities present in the Gramineae. Along with
   these phyllobilins, barley orthologs of known Arabidopsis thaliana
   chlorophyll catabolic enzymes were demonstrated to localize in the
   chloroplast, and two of them, i.e. PAO and pheophytin pheophorbide
   hydrolase, complemented respective Arabidopsis mutants. These data
   confirm functionality of the PAO/phyllobilin pathway in grasses.
   Interestingly, when comparing phyllobilin abundance with amounts of
   degraded chlorophyll in senescent leaves, in most analyzed grass species
   only minor fractions of chlorophyll were recovered as phyllobilins,
   opposite to A. thaliana where phyllobilin quantities match degraded
   chlorophyll rather well. These data show that, despite the presence and
   activity of the PAO/phyllobilin pathway in barley (and other cereals),
   phyllobilins do not accumulate stoichiometrically, implying possible
   degradation of chlorophyll beyond the phyllobilin level.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In the fight against rising overweight and obesity levels,
   and unhealthy urban environments, the renaissance of active mobility
   (cycling and walking as a transport mode) is encouraging. Transport mode
   has been shown to be associated to body mass index (BMI), yet there is
   limited longitudinal evidence demonstrating causality. We aimed to
   associate transport mode and BMI cross-sectionally, but also
   prospectively in the first ever European-wide longitudinal study on
   transport and health.
   Methods: Data were from the PASTA project that recruited adults in seven
   European cities (Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Oerebro, Rome, Vienna,
   Zurich) to complete a series of questionnaires on travel behavior,
   physical activity levels, and BMI. To assess the association between
   transport mode and BMI as well as change in BMI we performed crude and
   adjusted linear mixed-effects modeling for cross-sectional (n = 7380)
   and longitudinal (n = 2316) data, respectively.
   Results: Cross-sectionally, BMI was 0.027 kg/m(2) (95\%CI 0.015 to
   0.040) higher per additional day of car use per month. Inversely, BMI
   was - 0.010 kg/m(2) (95\%CI - 0.020 to - 0.0002) lower per additional
   day of cycling per month. Changes in BMI were smaller in the
   longitudinal within-person assessment, however still statistically
   significant. BMI decreased in occasional (less than once per week) and
   non-cyclists who increased cycling (- 0.303 kg/m(2), 95\%CI - 0.530 to -
   0.077), while frequent (at least once per week) cyclists who stopped
   cycling increased their BMI (0.417 kg/m(2), 95\%CI 0.033 to 0.802).
   Conclusions: Our analyses showed that people lower their BMI when
   starting or increasing cycling, demonstrating the health benefits of
   active mobility.}},

Abstract = {{Glacier shrinkage is a strong driver of change for mountain hydrology
   and landscape development and bears multiple risks as well as new
   options for human livelihoods. In the tropical Andes, current rates of
   glacier loss are investigated to some point but associated future extent
   of both vanishing glacier and forming lake areas and volumes are poorly
   explored. This study combines an analysis of current (1988-2016) and
   future (2050/2100) glacier and lake development in the
   Vilcanota-Urubamba basin (Cusco, Southern Peru). Total glacier area
   (volume) decreased by 37.3\% (20.5\%) from 226.1 km(2) (8.122 km(3)) in
   1988 to 141.7 km(2) (6.457 km(3)) in 2016. Adjacent lakes increased in
   area (number) by 15.5\% (18.3\%) from 23.3 km(2) (460 lakes) in 1988 to
   26.9 km(2) (544 lakes) in 2016 while corresponding lake volume has grown
   by 9.7\% from 0.637 km(3) to 0.699 km(3), respectively. High
   spatiotemporal variability can be observed in the basin, with strongest
   glacier shrinkage in the lower lying northwest (Cordilleras Urubamba and
   Vilcabamba) and highest growth and lake extent in the Altiplano region
   of the southeast (Cordillera Vilcanota and Quelccaya ice cap). Future
   glacier areas could substantially decrease between 40.7\% (RCP2.6) and
   44.9\% (RCP8.5) within the next decades (2031-2060) and between 41.4\%
   and 92.7\%, respectively, within this century (2071-2100). Hence, Andean
   landscapes would transform into mostly glacier-free areas with some
   remaining ice-covered summits over similar to 6000 m asl. and this would
   imply a loss of permanently stored water of several km(3). Until the end
   of this century, important future lake areas could develop and continue
   to grow between 3.2\% (RCP 2.6) and 6.0\% (RCP8.5) with an associated
   volume increase of 0.032 km(3) (4.6\%) and 0.041 km(3) (5.9\%),
   respectively. Our current baseline and future projections suggest that a
   decrease of glacier shrinkage is also followed by a slowdown in lake
   formation and particularly volume growth which might have already
   developed or occur in the near-future. Under the depicted scenarios of
   change, strong emphasis needs to be promptly put on feasible water
   management and storage options as robust adaptation measures tackling
   high uncertainties, risks and complex hydroclimatic and
   socioenvironmental intertwining.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Cooperation among kin is common across the natural world and can be
   explained in terms of inclusive fitness theory, which holds that
   individuals can derive indirect fitness benefits from aiding genetically
   related individuals. However, human kinship includes not only genetic
   kin but also kin by marriage: our affines (in-laws) and spouses. Can
   cooperation between these genetically unrelated kin be reconciled with
   inclusive fitness theory? Here, we argue that although affinal kin and
   spouses do not necessarily share genetic ancestry, they may have shared
   genetic interests in future reproduction and, as such, can derive
   indirect fitness benefits though cooperating. We use standard inclusive
   fitness theory to derive a coefficient of shared reproductive interest
   (s) that predicts altruistic investment both in genetic kin and in
   spouses and affines. Specifically, a behaviour that reduces the fitness
   of the actor by c and increases the fitness of the recipient by b will
   be favoured by natural selection when sb > c. We suggest that the
   coefficient of shared reproductive interest may provide a valuable tool
   for understanding not only the evolution of human kinship but also
   cooperation and conflict across the natural world more generally.}},

Abstract = {{Since the publication of the fluid mosaic as a relevant model for

   subcompartmentalization, and this is emerging as a general trait with
   different features and properties. It is now evident that the dynamics
   of such a complex organization are intrinsically related to signaling
   pathways that regulate key physiological processes. Listing and linking
   recent progress in precisely qualifying these heterogeneities will help
   to draw an integrated picture of the plant PM. Understanding the key
   principles governing such a complex dynamic organization will contribute
   to deciphering the crucial role of the PM in cell physiology.}},

Abstract = {{The expensive brain hypothesis predicts that the lowest stable level of
   steady energy input acts as a strong constraint on a species' brain
   size, and thus, that periodic troughs in net energy intake should select
   for reduced brain size relative to body mass. Here, we test this
   prediction for the extreme case of hibernation. Hibernators drastically
   reduce food intake for up to several months and are therefore expected
   to have smaller relative brain sizes than nonhibernating species. Using
   a comparative phylogenetic approach on brain size estimates of 1104
   mammalian species, and controlling for possible confounding variables,
   we indeed found that the presence of hibernation in mammals is
   correlated with decreased relative brain size. This result adds to
   recent comparative work across mammals and amphibians supporting the
   idea that environmental seasonality (where in extremis hibernation is
   necessary for survival) imposes an energetic challenge and thus acts as
   an evolutionary constraint on relative brain size.}},

Abstract = {{Below ground carbon (BGC) inputs to soil, i.e. root biomass and
   rhizodeposition carbon (C), are among the most important variables
   driving soil C dynamics in agroecosystems. Hence, increasing BGC inputs
   to deep soil is a proposed strategy to sequester C in the long term. As
   BGC inputs are inherently difficult to measure in the field, they are
   usually estimated from yield in order to supply soil C models with input
   data. While fertilization intensity considerably affects above ground
   biomass, its influence on BGC inputs is largely unclear, especially with
   respect to the subsoil. Therefore, we determined net root biomass and
   rhizodeposition C of field-grown maize and wheat at harvest in different
   farming systems (bio-organic, conventional) and fertilization treatments
   (zero, manure, mineral) along an intensity gradient in two Swiss
   long-term field trials. Plants in microplots were repeatedly
   pulse-labelled with C-13-CO2 throughout the growing seasons and shoots,
   roots, and soil to 0.75 m depth were sampled at harvest. Despite a
   strong increase of above ground biomass with increasing fertilization
   intensity, BGC inputs were similar among treatments on both sites
   irrespective of soil depth. However, the proportions of rhizodeposition
   C of BGC inputs averaged 54 to 63\% and were, therefore, much larger
   than the widely adopted 40\% for field-grown cereals. They increased
   with soil depth and were highest under sole organic fertilization. The
   shift in whole-plant C allocation towards above ground biomass with
   increasing fertilization intensity entailed 10\% higher C allocation
   below ground in organic than conventional farming for both maize and
   wheat. Our findings imply that yield-independent values provide closer
   estimates for BGC inputs to soil of cereals in different farming systems
   than yield-based functions. We further conclude that fertilization has
   only little potential to alter absolute amounts of BGC inputs to deep
   soil in order to sequester C in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{The root anatomy of 291 of the 350 species of the African Restionaceae,
   one of the ecologically dominant and taxonomically diverse elements of
   the Cape flora, is reported. There is substantial variation in the
   cortex (either collapses in older roots or persists as an aerenchyma),
   endodermis (in relative size, shape of the endodermal cells, and degree
   of wall thickening), pericycle (from 1 to 10 cells, varying from
   unthickened to massively thickened), and the metaxylem vessels (5 to
   more than 100, organized in a ring or scattered). Almost all root
   anatomical characters are phylogenetically constrained, similar to the
   culm anatomical characters. Although it is possible to, based on root
   anatomy, recognize groups of genera with broadly similar root anatomies,
   there are often also exceptions, indicating some evolutionary lability.
   Variation not phylogenetically controlled is significantly explained by
   differences in ground water availability and mean annual precipitation.
   The descriptive data are available in an online interactive key. The
   variation in root anatomy may contribute interesting insight into the
   evolution of this unusual group of plants.}},

Abstract = {{Contact skin temperature (T (sk)) sensors are calibrated under uniform
   thermal conditions but used in the presence of a skin-to-environment
   temperature gradient. We aimed to characterise the validity of contact T
   (sk) sensors when measuring surface temperature under a range of
   environmental and fabric coverage conditions, to estimate practical
   temperature limits for a given measurement bias and to explore
   correcting for bias. Using two types of contact T (sk) sensors
   (thermistors, n = 5; iButtons, n = 5), we performed experiments in three
   phases: (1) conventional calibration (uniform thermal environment) over
   15-40 A degrees C in 5 A degrees C steps (at t = 0, and 24 h, 12 weeks
   later), (2) surface temperature measurements of a purpose-made aluminium
   plate (also 15-40 A degrees C) at different environmental temperatures
   (15, 25, 35 A degrees C) with different sensor attachments and fabric
   coverings to assess measurement bias and calculate correction factors
   that account for the next-to-surface microclimate temperature and (3)
   surface measurements (33.1 A degrees C in 20 A degrees C environment)
   for assessing generated corrections. The main results were as follows:
   (1) after initial calibration, T (sk) sensors were valid under uniform
   thermal conditions {[}mean bias < 0.05 A degrees C, typical error of the
   estimate < 0.1 A degrees C]. (2) For the surface measurements, bias
   increased with increasing surface-to-microclimate temperature difference
   for both sensor types. The range of surface temperatures possible to
   remain within given bias limits could be estimated for the various
   conditions. (3) For a given measurement, using corrections encompassing
   the microclimate temperature (mean difference - 0.1 to 0.5 A degrees C)
   performed better than conventional calibration alone (mean difference -
   2.1 to - 0.3 A degrees C). In conclusion, the bias of T (sk) sensors is
   influenced by the microclimate temperature and, therefore, body
   coverings. Where excessive bias is expected, the validity can be
   improved through sensor and attachment selection and by applying
   corrections that account for the local temperature gradient.}},

Abstract = {{Information about the ice volume stored in glaciers is of high
   importance for sustainable water management in many arid regions of
   Central Asia. Several methods to estimate the ice volume exist. However,
   none of them take the specific characteristics of flat terminus
   debris-covered glaciers into account. We present a method for deriving
   spatially-distributed ice thickness for debris-covered dendritic
   glaciers, which are common not only in Central Tien Shan but also in
   several other mountain ranges in High Asia. The method relies on
   automatically generated branch lines, observed surface velocities and
   surface topographic parameters as basic input. Branch lines were
   generated using Thiessen polygons and Dijkstra's path algorithm. Ice
   thicknesses for four debris-covered glaciers - South Inylchek, Kaindy,
   Tomur and Koxkar glaciers - have been estimated along the branch line
   network solving the equation of laminar flow. For Koxkar and South
   Inylchek glaciers, respectively, maximum thicknesses of similar to 250
   and 380 m were estimated. These results differ by similar to 50 m
   compared with GPR measurements with an uncertainty for the
   debris-covered parts of similar to 40\%. Based on geodetic mass
   balances, we estimate that the investigated glaciers lost between 6 and
   28\% of their volume from 1975 to the early 2000s.}},

Abstract = {{Landscapes and soils evolve in non-linear ways over millennia. Current
   knowledge is incomplete as only average denudation (or erosion) rates
   are normally estimated, neglecting the temporal discontinuities of these
   processes. The determination of regressive and progressive phases of
   soil evolution is important to our understanding of how soils and
   landscapes respond to environmental changes. The Sila Massif (Italy)
   provides a well-defined geomorphological and geological setting to
   unravel temporal variations in soil redistribution rates. We used a
   combination of in situ cosmogenic radionuclide measurements (Be-10)
   along tor (residual rock) height profiles, coupled with fallout
   radionuclides (Pu239+240) in soils, to model soil denudation rates over
   the last 100ka. We measured rates prior to the Last Glacial Maximum
   (LGM) of 30tkm(-2)yr(-1) (similar to 0.036mmyr(-1)). Following the LGM,
   during the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, these rates
   increased to similar to 150-200tkm(-2)yr(-1) and appeared to be above
   soil production rates, causing regressive soil evolution. For the last
   similar to 50years, we even describe erosion rates of 1,000tkm(-2)yr(-1)
   (similar to 1.23mmyr(-1)) and consider human impact as the decisive
   factor for this development. Consequently, the natural soil production
   rates cannot cope with the current erosion rates. Thus, a distinct
   regressive phase of soil formation exists, which will give rise to
   shallowing of soils over time. Overall, our multimethod approach traced
   denudation and erosion histories over geologic and human timescales and
   made a new archive to soil science and geomorphology accessible.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research.Fruit structure, in contrast to flower structure,
   has not been the subject of detailed comparative studies in many
   angiosperm lineages. This study focuses on fruit morphology, anatomy,
   and histology of the family Calycanthaceae (Laurales), including all
   genera: Calycanthus (including Sinocalycanthus), Chimonanthus, and
   Idiospermum. The results are compared with the fruit structures of all
   other families of Laurales.Methodology.We use standard methods of
   histological research, microtome sectioning, light microscopy, and
   scanning electron microscopy. Histology is studied in young, midstage,
   and mature fruits.Pivotal results.The fruiting carpels in Calycanthaceae
   are covered by the floral cup (receptacle) but not fused with it. In
   Calycanthus and Chimonanthus, the fruitlets are drupes of the Laurus
   type with the stone consisting of only the endocarp (one cell layer). In
   Idiospermum, the fruiting carpel is technically a berry. Development
   shows that fruitlets of Calycanthoideae have a thin mesocarp and a
   lignified palisade endocarp, whereas in Idiospermoideae there is a
   multicell-layered mesocarp with histological subzones and a
   parenchymatous endocarp.Conclusions.The sclerenchymatous palisade
   endocarp, and the mode of its development, is similar in drupes of the
   Laurus type of Calycanthoideae, Hernandiaceae, and Lauraceae. In
   contrast, the structure of the parenchymatous pericarp, which may be
   partly obliterated in fruiting carpels in berries of Idiospermoideae, is
   similar to that in some Atherospermataceae and Monimiaceae with a berry
   fruit type.}},

Abstract = {{Despite growing interest in incorporating intraspecific variation of
   functional traits in community-level studies, it remains unclear whether
   species classified into functional groups based on interspecific trait
   differences are similar regarding their variation in trait expression in
   response to varying plant diversity and composition in local
   communities. In a large biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment)
   designed on a trait-based a priori definition of functional groups
   (grasses, legumes, small herbs, tall herbs), we studied means, extent of
   variation (coefficient of variation across communities) and plasticity
   to increased plant diversity (slopes over a logarithmic species richness
   ranging from 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 to 60 species) for nine functional
   traits. Species means and extent of variation in traits related to
   nitrogen (N) acquisition and N use differed among functional groups and
   were more similar in phylogenetically closely related species than
   expected by chance. Species in the same functional group showed a weak
   phylogenetic signal and varied widely in means and extent of variation
   in traits related to shoot architecture and to a smaller extent in leaf
   traits related to carbon acquisition. This indicated that functional
   groups were less distinguishable in light than in nitrogen acquisition
   strategies. The direction and degree of trait plasticity to increasing
   species richness did not show a phylogenetic signal and were not
   different among functional groups, but varied largely among species
   within functional groups. Correlation structures in trait means, extent
   of trait variation and trait plasticity revealed functional tradeoffs in
   the acquisition of nitrogen and light across species. While correlations
   between trait means and extent of trait variation varied from trait to
   trait (positive, negative or unrelated), trait means and trait
   plasticity were mostly unrelated. Our results suggest that the concept
   of functional groups is viable, but context-specific trait measurements
   are required to improve our understanding about the functional
   significance of intraspecific trait variation and interspecific trait
   differences in local plant communities.}},

Title = {{Detecting Human Presence and Influence on Neotropical Forests with
   Remote Sensing}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The Amazon, and Neotropical forests, are one of the most important
   global biomes because of their extent and unique biodiversity, as well
   as their importance to global climate and as a habitat and resource for
   humans. Unravelling the influence of human presence on these forests is
   fundamental to our understanding of the biodiversity, ecosystem
   function, and service-providing potential. Human presence in these
   tropical rainforests dates back 13,000 years, and the impacts of this
   presence are hotly debated. Some authors suggest persistent effects of
   pre-Columbian plant domestication on current Amazonian forest
   composition. Other authors suggest that post-Columbian influence on
   forest composition is orders of magnitude higher than that of
   pre-Columbian times. Evidence from remote sensing has become
   increasingly useful as a way to help settle these debates. Here we
   review past, current, and future uses of remote sensing technology to
   detect human infrastructure in the Amazon and other Neotropical forests
   over the several historical periods of human presence, from
   archaeological to post-modern societies. We define human presence in
   terms of activities that left behind a footprint, such as settlements,
   earth-mounds, roads, use of timber and fuelwood, agriculture, soil, etc.
   Lastly, we discuss opportunities and challenges for the use of remote
   sensing to provide data and information necessary to expand our
   understanding of the history of human occupation in the Neotropical
   forests, and how this human occupation might affect biodiversity. There
   have been many recent applications of remote sensing to the detection of
   Pre-Columbian human infrastructure, from visual inspection of aerial
   photographs over deforested sites to uses of LiDAR on airborne and UAV
   platforms to detect infrastructure and smaller settlements under the
   canopy. Similar efforts are yet to be conducted for the Post-Columbian
   period, especially during the colonization and imperialism periods.
   Finally, our knowledge of human impacts in the modern era (20th and 21st
   centuries) is not-surprisingly more extensive. Remote sensing is still
   under-used and extremely useful for this type of application, and new
   missions might provide solutions that were unavailable before. Yet
   systematic ground surveys are irreplaceable, and detection accuracies of
   human presence from the combination of remote sensing and ground surveys
   need to be improved. It is vital therefore to understand how Neotropical
   forest biodiversity has developed in the presence of people in the past,
   the implications of this for predicting future directions of change in
   the Amazon and elsewhere.}},

   giganteum}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In the wild, social groups of the cellular slime mould amoeba
   Dictyostelium giganteum are genetically heterogeneous more often than
   not. When studied as 1:1 binary mixes, amoebae of one strain almost
   always form more spores than the other, an observation that leads one to
   wonder what might be responsible for the long-term persistence of
   different strains in nature. We have monitored a number of individual
   and collective traits bearing on reproductive fitness in chimaeras of
   Dictyostelium giganteum obtained by mixing pairs of starved amoebae
   belonging to distinct wild-type strains in proportions ranging from 1:9
   to 9:1. The main findings are that intercellular interactions take place
   at more than one stage of the life cycle and that generalisations drawn
   after mixing cells only in a 1:1 ratio can be misleading. A strain that
   does better than another in respect of some component of fitness (for
   example, spore formation) may do worse in respect of a different
   component (for example, growth rate). Also, a strain that is a more
   efficient sporulator than a second strain in one context may be less
   efficient in another context. In addition to such trade-offs, spore
   formation in chimaeras can exhibit negative frequency dependence, which
   too can lead to stable co-existence.Significance statementHumans live in
   social groups whose members perform different but equally important
   tasks. When they do so freely, the long-term stability of the group
   depends on give and take (trade-offs') between individuals who are
   generally unrelated. In contrast, studies of cooperation in non-human
   animals have focussed on relatedness through common descent as
   responsible for the maintenance of group cohesion. But animal groups too
   contain unrelated individuals. Using the example of a social amoeba, we
   show that this need not rule out a high level of cooperation including
   so-called altruism, as long as inter-individual interactions permit it.
   In both genetically homogeneous and heterogeneous groups, interactions
   can result in trade-offs between different traits. In genetically
   heterogeneous groups, they can also lead to a negative correlation
   between the efficiency with which cells of a genotype reproduce and the
   proportion of cells belonging to that genotype.}},

Title = {{Genetic differentiation, phenotypic plasticity and adaptation in a

Journal = {{ALPINE BOTANY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{149-167}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypic variation may be genetically determined or reflect phenotypic
   plasticity. More common plants are expected to be less differentiated
   between and within regions and more adapted than less common ones.
   However, such differences might not develop in hybridizing species which
   cannot evolve completely independently. We collected 311 genets of Carex
   flava, 215 of C. viridula and 46 of their hybrid C.xsubviridula from 42
   natural populations in cold temperate Estonia, mild temperate Lowland
   Switzerland and alpine Highland Switzerland. Three plantlets from each
   genet were planted to three experimental gardens, one in each region. We
   measured survival, growth, reproduction and morphological traits. The
   experimental transplants showed strong plasticity and grew smallest in
   the alpine garden. The less common C. viridula was slightly more
   differentiated between regions of origin than the more common C. flava
   and the hybrid. However, this depended on the experimental garden.
   Significant origin-by-garden-by-taxon and taxon-by-garden interactions
   suggest differential adaptation among populations and taxa. Regional
   differed from non-regional plants in several traits indicating both
   adaptations and, especially for C. viridula, maladaptations to the home
   regions. For C. flava, plant seed production was higher when mean annual
   temperature and precipitation were more similar between population of
   origin and garden, suggesting local adaptation to climate. Hybrids were
   intermediate between parental taxa or more similar to one of them, which
   was retained across gardens. We conclude that plasticity, genetic
   variation and genotype-environment interactions all contributed to
   regional differentiation of the closely related species. Hybridization
   did not completely align evolutionary patterns, and the less common
   species showed slightly more genetic differentiation between populations
   and more maladapted traits than the more common one.}},

Abstract = {{Key messageWe have isolated a novel powdery mildew resistance gene in
   wheat that was originally introgressed from rye. Further analysis
   revealed evolutionary divergent history of wheat and rye orthologous
   resistance genes.AbstractWheat production is under constant threat from
   a number of fungal pathogens, among them is wheat powdery mildew
   (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici). Deployment of resistance genes is
   the most economical and sustainable method for mildew control. However,
   domestication and selective breeding have narrowed genetic diversity of
   modern wheat germplasm, and breeders have relied on wheat relatives for
   enriching its gene pool through introgression. Translocations where the
   1RS chromosome arm was introgressed from rye to wheat have improved
   yield and resistance against various pathogens. Here, we isolated the
   Pm17 mildew resistance gene located on the 1RS introgression in wheat
   cultivar Amigo' and found that it is an allele or a close paralog of the
   Pm8 gene isolated earlier from Petkus' rye. Functional validation using
   transient and stable transformation confirmed the identity of Pm17.
   Analysis of Pm17 and Pm8 coding regions revealed an overall identity of
   82.9\% at the protein level, with the LRR domains being most divergent.
   Our analysis also showed that the two rye genes are much more diverse
   compared to the variants encoded by the Pm3 gene in wheat, which is
   orthologous to Pm17/Pm8 as concluded from highly conserved upstream
   sequences in all these genes. Thus, the evolutionary history of these
   orthologous loci differs in the cereal species rye and wheat and
   demonstrates that orthologous resistance genes can take different routes
   towards functionally active genes. These findings suggest that the
   isolation of Pm3/Pm8/Pm17 orthologs from other grass species, additional
   alleles from the rye germplasm as well as possibly synthetic variants
   will result in novel resistance genes useful in wheat breeding.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the environmental parameters that determine aerobic

   approach}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{209}},
Pages = {{430-438}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aerobic biodegradation half-lives (half-lives) are key parameters used
   to evaluate pesticide persistence in soil. However, half-life estimates
   for individual pesticides often span several orders of magnitude,
   reflecting the impact that various environmental or experimental
   parameters have on half-lives in soil. In this work, we collected
   literature-reported half-lives for eleven pesticides along with
   associated metadata describing the environmental or experimental
   conditions under which they were derived. We then developed a
   multivariable framework to discover relationships between the half-lives
   and associated metadata. We first compared data for the herbicide
   atrazine collected from 95 laboratory and 65 field studies. We
   discovered that atrazine application history and soil texture were the
   parameters that have the largest influence on the observed half-lives in
   both types of studies. We then extended the analysis to include ten
   additional pesticides with data collected exclusively from laboratory
   studies. We found that, when data were available, pesticide application
   history and biomass concentrations were always positively associated
   with half-lives. The relevance of other parameters varied among the
   pesticides, but in some cases the variability could be explained by the
   physicochemical properties of the pesticides. For example, we found that
   the relative significance of the organic carbon content of soil for
   determining half-lives depends on the relative solubility of the
   pesticide. Altogether, our analyses highlight the reciprocal influence
   of both environmental parameters and intrinsic physicochemical
   properties for determining half-lives in soil. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

   Arabidopsis showed good dose-effect when treated by heavy metals. S.
   glauca showed better tolerance capacity for Cd, Pb and Mn, when compared
   with Arabidopsis. Moreover, the physical and chemical properties of soil
   were significantly improved after phytoremediation. The soil catalase
   activity decreased with increased concentration of metal treatments,
   which showed similar regularity with microbial community. Changes of
   microbial community could not only indicate the soil environment but
   also suggest that S. glauca plants had better influences on the soil
   microbial environment. The introduction of plants resulted in a 0.5-0.8
   units change in soil pH compared with the initial pH level. The present
   study provided the potential of S. glauca plants for phytoremediation in
   contaminated soil. Microbial community of Suaeda and Arabidopsis were
   evaluated and showed different regularity because of the rhizosphere
   effect. Soil microorganisms played an important role in the process of
   bioremediation. Meantime the main problems about physical and chemical
   properties of mine tailings were improved. It could be of great
   significance to the large-scale resource utilization and economical
   remediation of mine tailings.}},

Title = {{Arabidopsis ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 8 (ERF8) has dual functions in ABA
   signaling and immunity}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) 8 is a member of one of the
   largest transcription factor families in plants, the APETALA2/ETHYLENE
   RESPONSIVE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) superfamily. Members of this superfamily
   have been implicated in a wide variety of processes such as development
   and environmental stress responses.
   Results: In this study we demonstrated that ERF8 is involved in both ABA
   and immune signaling. ERF8 overexpression induced programmed cell death
   (PCD) in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana. This PCD was salicylic
   acid (SA)-independent, suggesting that ERF8 acts downstream or
   independent of SA. ERF8-induced PCD was abolished by mutations within
   the ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, indicating ERF8
   induces cell death through its transcriptional repression activity. Two
   immunity-related mitogen-activated protein kinases, MITOGEN-ACTIVATED
   PROTEIN KINASE 4 (MPK4) and MPK11, were identified as ERF8-interacting
   proteins and directly phosphorylated ERF8 in vitro. Four putative MPK
   phosphorylation sites were identified in ERF8, one of which (Ser103) was
   determined to be the predominantly phosphorylated residue in vitro,
   while mutation of all four putative phosphorylation sites partially
   suppressed ERF8-induced cell death in N. benthamiana. Genome-wide
   transcriptomic analysis and pathogen growth assays confirmed a positive
   role of ERF8 in mediating immunity, as ERF8 knockdown or overexpression
   lines conferred compromised or enhanced resistance against the
   hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, respectively.
   Conclusions: Together these data reveal that the ABA-inducible
   transcriptional repressor ERF8 has dual roles in ABA signaling and
   pathogen defense, and further highlight the complex influence of ABA on
   plant-microbe interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Pain feels different in different social contexts, yet the mechanisms
   behind social pain modulation remain poorly understood. To elucidate the
   impact of social context on pain processing, we investigated how group
   membership, one of the most important social context factors, shapes
   pain relief behaviourally and neurally in humans undergoing functional
   neuroimaging. Participants repeatedly received pain relief from a member
   of their own group (ingroup treatment) or a member of a disliked
   outgroup (outgroup treatment). We observed a decrease in pain ratings
   and anterior insula (AI) pain responses after outgroup treatment, but
   not after ingroup treatment. Moreover, path analyses revealed that the
   outgroup treatment induced a stronger relief learning in the AI, which
   in turn altered pain processing, in particular if the participant
   entered the treatment with a negative impression toward the outgroup
   individual. The finding of enhanced analgesia after outgroup treatment
   is relevant for intergroup clinical settings. More generally, we found
   that group membership affects pain responses through neural learning and
   we thus elucidate one possible mechanism through which social context
   impacts pain processing.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is the most common symbiotic association of
   plants with microbes. AM fungi occur in the majority of natural habitats
   and they provide a range of important ecological services, in particular
   by improving plant nutrition, stress resistance and tolerance, soil
   structure and fertility. AM fungi also interact with most crop plants
   including cereals, vegetables, and fruit trees, therefore, they receive
   increasing attention for their potential use in sustainable agriculture.
   Basic research of the past decade has revealed the existence of a
   dedicated recognition and signaling pathway that is required for AM.
   Furthermore, recent evidence provided new insight into the exchange of
   nutritional benefits between the symbiotic partners. The great potential
   for application of AM has given rise to a thriving industry for
   AM-related products for agriculture, horticulture, and landscaping.
   Here, we discuss new developments in these fields, and we highlight

   Himachal Pradesh, Northern India}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{Climate risk assessments provide the basis for identifying those areas
   and people that have been, or potentially will be, most affected by the
   adverse impacts of climate change. They allow hot-spots to be
   identified, and serve as input for the prioritization and design of
   adaptation actions. Over recent years, at the level of international
   climate science and policy, there has been a shift in the
   conceptualization of vulnerability toward emergence of `climate risk' as
   a central concept. Despite this shift, few studies have operationalized
   these latest concepts to deliver assessment results at local, national,
   or regional scales, and clarity is lacking. Drawing from a pilot study
   conducted in the Indian Himalayas we demonstrate how core components of
   hazard, vulnerability, and exposure have been integrated to assess flood
   risk at two different scales, and critically discuss how these results
   have fed into adaptation planning. Firstly, within a state-wide
   assessment of glacial lake outburst flood risk, proxy indicators of
   exposure and vulnerability were combined with worst-case scenario
   modelling of the outburst hazard. At this scale, first-order assessment
   results are coarse, but have guided the design of monitoring strategies
   and other low-regret adaptation actions. Secondly, an assessment of
   seasonal monsoon and cloudburst-related flood risk was undertaken for
   individual mapped elements exposed along the main river valleys of Kullu
   district, drawing on innovative techniques using dendrogeomorphology to
   reconstruct potential flood magnitudes. Results at this scale have
   allowed specific adaptation strategies to be targeted towards hot-spots
   of risk. A comprehensive risk assessment must integrate across
   disciplines of physical and social science, to provide the necessary
   robust foundation for adaptation planning.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of plants to survive drought or waterlogging constitutes an
   important niche parameter, which might be particularly significant in
   explaining species coexistence in the species-rich and seasonally dry
   Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. However, the degree of
   physiological adaptation and specialization to these eco-hydrological
   parameters (the fundamental niche) cannot be readily inferred from
   correlative studies based on species distributions and spatial variation
   in environmental parameters (the realized niche). We used an ex situ
   greenhouse experiment to compare the fundamental hydrological niches
   (different mean annual precipitation, rainfall seasonality and soil
   drainage) of six eco-hydrologically divergent African Restionaceae
   species. Juvenile plants were subjected to six different watering
   treatments, ranging from no watering to waterlogging, to determine
   drought and waterlogging susceptibility and optimal growth conditions.
   We used the rate of biomass accumulation and survival rate as response
   measures. We found that species from dry and mesic (but well-drained)
   habitats had optimal or near-optimal growth at benign conditions (under
   which most restio species grow well). All species performed worse when
   droughted and died when not watered. Species from dry habitats tended to
   perform better (assessed in growth) than species from wet habitats under
   droughting. Species from wet habitats performed best when waterlogged,
   whereas species from dry habitats performed very poorly when waterlogged
   - thus showing that realized and fundamental niches covaried at the wet
   end of the hydrological gradient. We conclude that eco-hydrological
   parameters are part of the fundamental niche, and fundamental and
   realized species niches are approximately correlated along them. The
   distribution of wet habitat species appears not to reflect their drought
   tolerance, suggesting that it may not be predicted by bioclimatic
   variables, but rather by soil drainage characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{While mankind in the 21st century faces several sustainability
   challenges, many business practices remain on a nonsustainable pathway.
   At the same time, many scholars as well as managers consider maximizing
   shareholder wealth as the only business imperative. We argue that this
   situation calls for revisioningthat is, reorienting and redefiningwhat
   is meant by value creation. This revisioning requires a considerable
   broadening of our understanding about the purposes and functioning of
   businesses. Thus, we ask one central question: Value(s) for whom? In
   this article, we derive and discuss three phases of the academic debate
   on stakeholders and value creation. We argue that in today's third
   phase, the notion of collective value frames the debate. To enable
   transformations toward creating collective value, embedded relations
   with stakeholders are of central relevance. In a nutshell, the answer to
   our question is the following: Creating value(s) for stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{Disease-suppressive soils are ecosystems in which plants suffer less
   from root infections due to the activities of specific microbial
   consortia. The characteristics of soils suppressive to specific fungal
   root pathogens are comparable to those of adaptive immunity in animals,
   as reported by Raaijmakers and Mazzola (Science 352:1392-3, 2016), but
   the mechanisms and microbial species involved in the soil
   suppressiveness are largely unknown. Previous taxonomic and
   metatranscriptome analyses of a soil suppressive to the fungal root
   pathogen Rhizoctonia solani revealed that members of the
   Burkholderiaceae family were more abundant and more active in
   suppressive than in non-suppressive soils. Here, isolation, phylogeny,
   and soil bioassays revealed a significant disease-suppressive activity
   for representative isolates of Burkholderia pyrrocinia, Paraburkholderia
   caledonica, P. graminis, P. hospita, and P. terricola. In vitro
   antifungal activity was only observed for P. graminis. Comparative
   genomics and metabolite profiling further showed that the antifungal
   activity of P. graminis PHS1 was associated with the production of
   sulfurous volatile compounds encoded by genes not found in the other
   four genera. Site-directed mutagenesis of two of these genes, encoding a
   dimethyl sulfoxide reductase and a cysteine desulfurase, resulted in a
   loss of antifungal activity both in vitro and in situ. These results
   indicate that specific members of the Burkholderiaceae family contribute
   to soil suppressiveness via the production of sulfurous volatile
   compounds.}},

Abstract = {{The family Nymphaeaceae includes most of the diversity among the
   ANA-grade angiosperms. Among the species of this family, floral
   structures and pollination strategies vary. The genus Victoria, as well
   as subgenera Lotos and Hydrocallis in Nymphaea, present night-blooming,
   scented flowers pollinated by scarab beetles. Such similar pollination
   strategies have led to macromorphological similarities among the flowers
   of these species, which could be interpreted as homologies or
   convergences based on different phylogenetic hypotheses about the
   relationships of these groups. We employed scanning electron microscopy
   of floral epidermis for seven species of the Nymphaeaceae with
   contrasting pollination biology to identify the main characters of the
   floral organs and the potential homologous nature of the structures
   involved in pollinator attraction. Moreover, we used transmission
   electron microscopy to observe ultrastructure of papillate-conical
   epidermis in the stamen of Victoria cruziana. We then tested the
   phylogenetic or ecological distribution of these traits using both
   consensus network approaches and ancestral state reconstruction on fixed
   phylogenies. Our results show that the night-blooming flowers present
   different specialisations in their epidermis, with V.cruziana presenting
   the most elaborate floral anatomy. We also identify for the first time
   the presence of conical-papillate cells in the order Nymphaeales. The
   epidermal characters tend to reflect phylogenetic relationships more
   than convergence due to pollinator selection. These results point to an
   independent and parallel evolution of scarab pollination in Nymphaeaceae
   and demonstrate the promise of floral anatomy as a phylogenetic marker.
   Moreover, they indicate a degree of sophistication in the anatomical
   basis of cantharophilous flowers in the Nymphaeales that diverges from
   the most simplistic views of floral evolution in the angiosperms.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial variation in pathogen-mediated selection is predicted to
   influence the evolutionary trajectory of host populations and lead to
   spatial variation in their immunogenetic composition. However, to date
   few studies have been able to directly link small-scale spatial
   variation in infection risk to host immune gene evolution in natural,
   nonhuman populations. Here, we use a natural rodent-Borrelia system to
   test for associations between landscape-level spatial variation in
   Borrelia infection risk along replicated elevational gradients in the
   Swiss Alps and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) evolution, a candidate gene
   for Borrelia resistance, across bank vole (Myodes glareolus)
   populations. We found that Borrelia infection risk (i.e., the product of
   Borrelia prevalence in questing ticks and the average tick load of voles
   at a sampling site) was spatially variable and significantly negatively
   associated with elevation. Across sampling sites, Borrelia prevalence in
   bank voles was significantly positively associated with Borrelia
   infection risk along the elevational clines. We observed a significant
   association between naturally occurring TLR2 polymorphisms in hosts and
   their Borrelia infection status. The TLR2 variant associated with a
   reduced likelihood of Borrelia infection was most common in rodent
   populations at lower elevations that face a high Borrelia infection
   risk, and its frequency changed in accordance with the change in
   Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. These results
   suggest that small-scale spatial variation in parasite-mediated
   selection affects the immunogenetic composition of natural host
   populations, providing a striking example that the microbial environment
   shapes the evolution of the host's immune system in the wild.}},

   Assessment (LCA) of Bamboo-Based Buildings}},

Abstract = {{The past five decades have witnessed an unprecedented growth in
   population. This has led to an ever-growing housing demand. It has been
   proposed that the use of bio-based materials, and specifically bamboo,
   can help alleviate the housing demand in a sustainable manner. The
   present paper aims to assess the environmental impact caused by using
   four different construction materials (bamboo, brick, concrete hollow
   block, and engineered bamboo) in buildings. A comparative life cycle
   assessment (LCA) was carried out to measure the environmental impact of
   the different construction materials in the construction of single and
   multi-storey buildings. The LCA considered the extraction, production,
   transport, and use of the construction materials. The IPCC2013
   evaluation method from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   IPCC2013 was used for the calculations of CO2 emissions. The assessment
   was geographically located in Colombia, South America, and estimates the
   transport distances of the construction materials. The results show that
   transportation and reinforcing materials significantly contribute to the
   environmental impact, whereas the engineered bamboo construction system
   has the lowest environmental impact. The adoption of bamboo-based
   construction systems has a significant potential to support the
   regenerative development of regions where they could be used and might
   lead to long-lasting improvements to economies, environments, and
   livelihoods.}},

Abstract = {{1. Habitat loss and modification are hallmarks of anthropogenic
   ecosystems, but the consequences for ecosystem functioning and service
   provisioning often remain unclear. Understanding these links in cities
   is complicated by strong but fine-scale differences in habitat structure
   among green space patches, and a high variance in habitat amount across
   urban landscapes.
   2. We used airborne laser scanning data to disentangle the effects of 3D
   woody habitat heterogeneity of urban home gardens, and woody habitat
   amount at four landscape spatial scales (50, 100, 250, and 500 m), on
   the predation risk of artificial sentinel prey by birds and arthropods.
   3. In both predator groups, and at all the investigated spatial scales,
   cross-scale interactive effects between garden habitat heterogeneity and
   habitat amount in the urban landscape were the main drivers of
   predation. Risk of predation by birds was highest in heterogeneous
   garden habitats, but only in densely built urban landscapes where
   habitat amount was low to intermediate (10\%-20\%) at large spatial
   scales (250-500 m). It dropped independently of garden habitat
   heterogeneity when habitat amount became too low (<10\%) at small
   (50-100 m) spatial scales. In contrast, risk of predation by arthropods
   mostly peaked in homogeneous garden habitats when habitat amount was
   intermediate (20\%) at large spatial scales.
   4. Our findings show that the ability of urban green space patches, such
   as gardens, to sustain ecosystem functions in cities mainly depends on
   cross-scale interactive effects with larger scale habitat amount. In
   birds, predation activity can increase when high patch-scale habitat
   heterogeneity contrasts with reduced larger scale habitat amount,
   suggesting concentration effects. Yet, thresholds exist under which
   ecosystem functioning drops independently of habitat structure.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The potential of small-scale
   interventions to enhance habitat heterogeneity (e.g., by planting native
   trees with understorey shrubs) for restoring ecosystem functions, such
   as bird predation, in urban areas is dependent on wider landscape
   habitat structure. Urban planning should therefore adopt a multiscale
   approach to sustain and restore ecosystem functions and services; a
   simple but still not broadly recognized finding. Airborne laser scanning
   is a useful tool to infer habitat structure across a hierarchy of scales
   in spatially heterogeneous anthropogenic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines how accumulation of experience and knowledge by wind
   farm developers and turbine manufacturers contributed to productivity
   gains in China's wind power industry during its rapid expansion phase
   between 2005 and 2012. A learning curve analysis is conducted on an
   original dataset of 312 Chinese wind farms under the Clean Development
   Mechanism. A key strength of the dataset is that it includes data on
   actual, wind-farm level power generation. The analysis, based on
   third-party verified data, reveals that the experience and knowledge
   accumulation did not result in improvements in generation performance,
   turbine size, or unit turbine costs of Chinese wind farms. Rather,
   generation performance was driven by capital investments (i.e., larger
   and more expensive wind farms performed better). Turbine cost reductions
   were achieved by intense price competition which hampered investments in
   technology improvement and quality assurance. The Chinese wind power
   case demonstrates how market expansion, in the absence of carefully
   designed innovation policies that complement deployment policies, does
   not necessarily lead to technological learning. Fostering the
   technological capability of local industry can take a long time. When
   scale-up happens quickly, it is crucial to develop and refine local

   between qualitatively very different kinds of stresses? To answer this
   question, we subjected laboratory populations of Escherichia coli to
   selection over similar to 260 generations. The populations faced
   predictable and unpredictable environmental fluctuations across
   qualitatively different selection environments, namely, salt and acidic
   pH. We show that predictability of environmental fluctuations does not
   play a role in determining the extent of adaptation, although the extent
   of ancestral adaptation to the chosen selection environments is of key
   importance.}},

Abstract = {{Agroforestry systems in temperate Europe are known to provide both,
   provisioning and regulating ecosystem services (ES). Yet, it is poorly
   understood how these systems affect ES provision at a landscape scale in
   contrast to agricultural practises.
   This study aimed at developing a novel, spatially explicit model to
   assess and quantify bundles of provisioning and regulating ES provided
   by landscapes with and without agroforestry systems and to test the
   hypothesis that agroforestry landscapes provide higher amounts of
   regulating ES than landscapes dominated by monocropping.
   Focussing on ES that are relevant for agroforestry and agricultural
   practices, we selected six provisioning and regulating ES-{''}biomass
   production{''}, ``groundwater recharge{''}, ``nutrient retention{''},
   ``soil preservation{''}, ``carbon storage{''}, ``habitat and gene pool
   protection{''}. Algorithms for quantifying these services were
   identified, tested, adapted, and applied in a traditional cherry orchard
   landscape in Switzerland, as a case study. Eight landscape test sites of
   1 km x 1 km, four dominated by agroforestry and four dominated by
   agriculture, were mapped and used as baseline for the model.
   We found that the provisioning ES, namely the annual biomass yield, was
   higher in landscape test sites with agriculture, while the regulating ES
   were better represented in landscape test sites with agroforestry. The
   differences were found to be statistically significant for the
   indicators annual biomass yield, groundwater recharge rate, nitrate
   leaching, annual carbon sequestration, flowering resources, and share of
   semi-natural habitats.
   This approach provides an example for spatially explicit quantification
   of provisioning and regulating ES and is suitable for comparing
   different land use scenarii at landscape scale.}},

Title = {{Water primrose invasion changes successional pathways in an estuarine
   ecosystem}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Invasive species fundamentally change the bio-physical and ecological
   characteristics of the ecosystems they invade. Rapidly expanding
   invasive species may facilitate the spread of other invasive species,
   and successive invasion events may lead to novel species interactions
   that may push the system beyond its equilibrium state and change
   successional pathways. Knowing the direction of the invasion front may
   be useful to predict impacts of invasive species. Water primrose
   (Ludwigia spp.), one of the invasive floating macrophytes in the
   Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (hereafter, Delta), has increased in
   cover rapidly over the past three decades likely outcompeting native and
   non-native species, changing their functional relationships, with
   cascading effects in the macrophyte communities of the aquatic
   ecosystem. In this study, we analyze the directionality of water
   primrose invasion and assess which spaces it occupies, whether it has
   overcrowded or outcompeted other vegetation communities, and its
   implications for succession in the Delta. We used imaging spectroscopy
   data acquired in June of 2004, June of 2008, November of 2014, and
   October of 2016 for the 2500 km(2) of the Delta to map the communities
   of submerged macrophytes, floating macrophytes, and emergent marsh. We
   found that water primrose cover increased fourfold in the Delta over the
   past 13 yr, changing significantly in the central Delta and Liberty
   Island region from 122 ha in 2004 to 471 ha in 2016. Water primrose
   expanded first by spreading over open water and submerged macrophytes
   and, when that habitat was exhausted, primrose invasion switched
   direction and encroached into emergent marsh. This bilateral expansion
   to both open water and the marsh is likely to change rates of succession
   and affect the restoration of the native Delta marshes. Understanding
   the mechanisms behind the expansion dynamics of this invasive will allow
   managers to counter its impact on newly established vulnerable marshes.}},

Abstract = {{The soil ecosystem is critical for agricultural production, affecting
   many aspects of human health. Soil has more unknown biodiversity and
   edaphic parameters than any other ecosystem especially when polluted.
   Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were applied to research on
   toxicological characteristics of Pb and resistance mechanism of
   flavonols. Rhizosphere microorganisms-plants system, a unified system
   closely related to soil environment was taken as research object.
   Results emphasize gene expression changes in different test groups. Gene
   ontology enrichment and eggNOG showed that Pb has a toxic effect on gene
   and protein function which concentrated on ATPase and ATP-dependent
   activity. Differentially expressed genes in the flavonols group
   indicated that flavonols regulate amino acid transport and other
   transportation process related to Pb stress. Kegg analysis represents
   that Pb interferences energy production process via not only the
   upstream like glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) circle but also
   oxidative phosphorylation process, which can also produce reactive
   oxygen species and impact the eliminating process. Flavonols have shown
   the ability in alleviating toxic effect of Pb and improving the
   resistance of plants. Flavonols can recover the electronic transmission
   and other process in TCA and oxidative phosphorylation via ascorbic
   acid-glutathione metabolism. Flavonols activated antioxidative process
   and non-specific immunity via vitamins B-2-B-6 metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater ecosystems depend on surrounding terrestrial landscape for
   resources. Most important are terrestrial leaf litter subsidies, which
   differ depending on land use. We lack a good understanding of the
   variation of these inputs across spatial scales.
   We sought to determine: (1) the relative importance of local versus
   catchment-level forestation for benthic leaf litter biomass in streams,
   (2) how landscape configuration alters these relationships, and (3) how
   land use affects the quality and diversity of leaf litter subsidies.
   We measured biomass and identity of benthic leaf litter in 121 reaches
   in 10 independent catchments seasonally over the course of a year. We
   assessed direct and indirect effects of forestation, reach position, and
   seasonality on leaf litter biomass using structural equation models, and
   assessed how leaf litter diversity varied with land use.
   In catchments with forested headwaters, the degree of forestation and
   reach position in the catchment influenced benthic leaf litter biomass
   indirectly through local reach-scale forestation. In catchments where
   forest was only located downstream, or with minimal forest, none of
   these factors influenced reach-level benthic leaf litter. Leaf litter
   diversity peaked in fall in all land use types, but was generally lowest
   in forested reaches.
   Not only habitat amount, but its location relative to other habitats is
   important for ecosystem function in the context of cross-ecosystem
   material flows. Here, lack of upstream forest altered spatial patterns
   of leaf litter storage. Studies with high spatiotemporal resolution may
   further reveal effects of landscape configuration on other ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how ecological networks are organised over the course of
   an organism's lifetime is crucial for predicting the dynamics of
   interacting populations and communities across temporal scales. However,
   most studies so far considered only one life history stage at a time,
   such as adult, when studying networks of interacting species. Therefore,
   knowledge about how multiple life history stages affect the development
   and stability of plant-plant association networks is lacking. We
   measured the understory adult plant community and the soil seed bank
   across a plant age gradient of the nurse shrub Retama sphaerocarpa in an
   arid ecosystem in Spain. Using a multilayer network approach, we built
   adult understory-nurse and seed bank-nurse networks and analysed how
   network nestedness, species' role, and species specificity varied
   between them and with nurse plant age. We found that seed bank and adult
   understory networks changed depending on nurse plant age in two
   different ways. With increasing nurse plant age, adult understory
   networks became significantly more nested than seed bank networks. The
   nested architecture of seed bank networks was therefore a poor predictor
   of adult understory network nestedness. The contribution and specificity
   of species to network nestedness increased with increasing nurse plant
   age more in the adult understory than in seed bank networks, despite
   high species turnover. Our data show that life history and ontogeny
   affect the development of plant-plant association networks. Niche
   construction and environmental filtering along nurse ontogeny seem
   pivotal mechanisms structuring adult understory networks while the
   assembly of seed bank networks seems rather stochastic. We highlight the
   importance of mature plant communities for maintaining rare species
   populations and supporting the stability of ecological communities
   through time.}},

Journal = {{PLANT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1084-1101}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Genomic imprinting is a conspicuous feature of the endosperm, a triploid
   tissue nurturing the embryo and synchronizing angiosperm seed
   development. An unknown subset of imprinted genes (IGs) is critical for
   successful seed development and should have highly conserved functions.
   Recent genome-wide studies have found limited conservation of IGs among
   distantly related species, but there is a paucity of data from closely
   related lineages. Moreover, most studies focused on model plants with
   nuclear endosperm development, and comparisons with properties of IGs in
   cellular-type endosperm development are lacking. Using laser-assisted
   microdissection, we characterized parent-specific expression in the
   cellular endosperm of three wild tomato lineages (Solanum section
   Lycopersicon). We identified 1025 candidate IGs and 167 with putative
   homologs previously identified as imprinted in distantly related taxa
   with nuclear-type endosperm. Forty-two maternally expressed genes (MEGs)
   and 17 paternally expressed genes (PEGs) exhibited conserved imprinting
   status across all three lineages, but differences in power to assess
   imprinted expression imply that the actual degree of conservation might
   be higher than that directly estimated (20.7\% for PEGs and 10.4\% for
   MEGs). Regardless, the level of shared imprinting status was higher for
   PEGs than for MEGs, indicating dissimilar evolutionary trajectories.
   Expression-level data suggest distinct epigenetic modulation of MEGs and
   PEGs, and gene ontology analyses revealed MEGs and PEGs to be enriched
   for different functions. Importantly, our data provide evidence that
   MEGs and PEGs interact in modulating both gene expression and the
   endosperm cell cycle, and uncovered conserved cellular functions of IGs
   uniting taxa with cellular- and nuclear-type endosperm.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse experimental plant communities are more productive than
   monocultures. The increase of this biodiversity effect over time has
   been attributed to evolutionary selection for complementarity in
   mixtures. Here we show that evolutionary selection for enhanced net
   facilitative plant interactions occurred only in mixtures, while
   evolutionary selection for reduced net competition occurred in mixtures
   with mixture coexistence history and monocultures with monoculture
   coexistence history. Widespread declines in natural and agricultural
   biodiversity could therefore compromise potential evolution of
   facilitative interactions, that is, cornerstone processes in nature
   conservation and the development of sustainable agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{The recently published NCRP Commentary No. 27 evaluated the new
   information from epidemiologic studies as to their degree of support for
   applying the linear nonthreshold (LNT) model of carcinogenic effects for
   radiation protection purposes (NCRP 2018 Implications of Recent
   Epidemiologic Studies for the Linear Nonthreshold Model and Radiation
   Protection, Commentary No. 27 (Bethesda, MD: National Council on
   Radiation Protection and Measurements)). The aim was to determine
   whether recent epidemiologic studies of low-LET radiation, particularly
   those at low doses and/or low dose rates (LD/LDR), broadly support the
   LNT model of carcinogenic risk or, on the contrary, demonstrate
   sufficient evidence that the LNT model is inappropriate for the purposes
   of radiation protection. An updated review was needed because a
   considerable number of reports of radiation epidemiologic studies based
   on new or updated data have been published since other major reviews
   were conducted by national and international scientific committees. The
   Commentary provides a critical review of the LD/LDR studies that are
   most directly applicable to current occupational, environmental and
   medical radiation exposure circumstances. This Memorandum summarises
   several of the more important LD/LDR studies that incorporate radiation
   dose responses for solid cancer and leukemia that were reviewed in
   Commentary No. 27. In addition, an overview is provided of radiation
   studies of breast and thyroid cancers, and cancer after childhood
   exposures. Non-cancers are briefly touched upon such as ischemic heart
   disease, cataracts, and heritable genetic effects. To assess the
   applicability and utility of the LNT model for radiation protection, the
   Commentary evaluated 29 epidemiologic studies or groups of studies,
   primarily of total solid cancer, in terms of strengths and weaknesses in
   their epidemiologic methods, dosimetry approaches, and statistical
   modelling, and the degree to which they supported a LNT model for
   continued use in radiation protection. Recommendations for how to make
   epidemiologic radiation studies more informative are outlined. The NCRP
   Committee recognises that the risks from LD/LDR exposures are small and
   uncertain. The Committee judged that the available epidemiologic data
   were broadly supportive of the LNT model and that at this time no
   alternative dose-response relationship appears more pragmatic or prudent
   for radiation protection purposes.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{285}},
Number = {{1885}},

Abstract = {{Linguistic diversity is a key aspect of human population diversity and
   shapes much of our social and cognitive lives. To a considerable extent,
   the distribution of this diversity is driven by environmental factors
   such as climate or coast access. An unresolved question is whether the
   relevant factors have remained constant over time. Here, we address this
   question at a global scale. We approximate the difference between
   pre-versus post-Neolithic populations by the difference between modern
   hunter-gatherer versus food-producing populations. Using a novel
   geostatistical approach of estimating language and language family
   densities, we show that environmental-chiefly climate factors-have
   driven the language density of food-producing populations considerably
   more strongly than the language density of hunter-gatherer populations.
   Current evidence suggests that the population dynamics of modern
   hunter-gatherers is very similar to that of what can be reconstructed
   from the Palaeolithic record. Based on this, we cautiously infer that
   the impact of environmental factors on language densities underwent a
   substantial change with the transition to agriculture. After this
   transition, the environmental impact on language diversity in
   food-producing populations has remained relatively stable since it can
   also be detected-albeit in slightly weaker form-in models that capture
   the reduced linguistic diversity during large-scale language spreads in
   the Mid-Holocene.}},

Abstract = {{Natural sceneries or single plants may have positive influences on human
   health. Here we show that plant species richness can positively
   influence recovery from stress. Meadow-like arrays of different species
   richness (1, 16, 32, 64 species) were presented to visitors (n = 171) of
   a popular park in Zurich, Switzerland (one array per participant).
   Participants' systolic blood pressure was measured twice: directly after
   they had been stressed and once again after a 2 min post-stress
   relaxation period during which they looked at one of either the
   meadow-like arrangements of plants in pots or at bare ground, shielded
   on three sides by a tent-like structure. The decrease in blood pressure
   was larger when respondents could view an arrangement of plants instead
   of ground without vegetation. Relaxation was strongest at intermediate
   species richness (32 species). Age, gender, and a person's attachment to
   nature did not influence relaxation. Our results indicate that
   species-rich vegetation may contribute to recovery from stress which
   should be considered in landscape management and planning.}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Brassica rapa comprises several important cultivated vegetables and oil
   crops. Current reference genome assemblies of Brassica rapa are quite
   fragmented and not highly contiguous, thereby limiting extensive genetic
   and genomic analyses. Here, we report an improved assembly of the B.
   rapa genome (v3.0) using single-molecule sequencing, optical mapping,
   and chromosome conformation capture technologies (Hi-C). Relative to the
   previous reference genomes, our assembly features a contig N50 size of
   1.45 Mb, representing a similar to 30-fold improvement. We also
   identified a new event that occurred in the B. rapa genome similar to
   1.2 million years ago, when a long terminal repeat retrotransposon
   (LTR-RT) expanded. Further analysis refined the relationship of genome
   blocks and accurately located the centromeres in the B. rapa genome. The
   B. rapa genome v3.0 will serve as an important community resource for
   future genetic and genomic studies in B. rapa. This resource will
   facilitate breeding efforts in B. rapa, as well as comparative genomic

Abstract = {{Global biodiversity is eroding due to anthropogenic causes, such as
   climate change, habitat loss, and trophic simplification of biological
   communities. Most studies address only isolated causes within a single
   group of organisms; however, biological groups of different trophic
   levels may respond in particular ways to different environmental
   impacts. Our study used natural microcosms to investigate the predicted
   individual and interactive effects of warming, changes in top predator
   diversity, and habitat size on the alpha and beta diversity of
   macrofauna, microfauna, and bacteria. Alpha diversity (i.e., richness
   within each bromeliad) generally explained a larger proportion of the
   gamma diversity (partitioned in alpha and beta diversity). Overall,
   dissimilarity between communities occurred due to species turnover and
   not species loss (nestedness). Nevertheless, the three biological groups
   responded differently to each environmental stressor. Microfauna were
   the most sensitive group, with alpha and beta diversity being affected
   by environmental changes (warming and habitat size) and trophic
   structure (diversity of top predators). Macrofauna alpha and beta
   diversity was sensitive to changes in predator diversity and habitat
   size, but not warming. In contrast, the bacterial community was not
   influenced by the treatments. The community of each biological group was
   not mutually concordant with the environmental and trophic changes. Our
   results demonstrate that distinct anthropogenic impacts differentially
   affect the components of macro and microorganism diversity through
   direct and indirect effects (i.e., bottom-up and top-down effects).
   Therefore, a multitrophic and multispecies approach is necessary to
   assess the effects of different anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Ecotones between distinct ecosystems have been the focus of many studies
   as they offer valuable insights into key drivers of community structure
   and ecological processes that underpin function. While previous studies
   have examined a wide range of above-ground parameters in ecotones, soil
   microbial communities have received little attention. Here we
   investigated spatial patterns, composition, and co-occurrences of
   archaea, bacteria, and fungi, and their relationships with soil
   ecological processes across a woodland-grassland ecotone. Geostatistical
   kriging and network analysis revealed that the community structure and
   spatial patterns of soil microbiota varied considerably between three
   habitat components across the ecotone. Woodland samples had
   significantly higher diversity of archaea while the grassland samples
   had significantly higher diversity of bacteria. Microbial co-occurrences
   reflected differences in soil properties and ecological processes. While
   microbial networks were dominated by bacterial nodes, different
   ecological processes were linked to specific microbial guilds. For
   example, soil phosphorus and phosphatase activity formed the largest
   clusters in their respective networks, and two lignolytic enzymes formed
   joined clusters. Bacterial ammonia oxidizers were dominant over archaeal
   oxidizers and showed a significant association (p<0.001) with potential
   nitrification (PNR), with the PNR subnetwork being dominated by
   Betaproteobacteria. The top ten keystone taxa comprised six bacterial
   and four fungal OTUs, with Random Forest Analysis revealing soil carbon
   and nitrogen as the determinants of the abundance of keystone taxa. Our
   results highlight the importance of assessing interkingdom associations
   in soil microbial networks. Overall, this study shows how ecotones can
   be used as a model to delineate microbial structural patterns and
   ecological processes across adjoining land-uses within a landscape.}},

Abstract = {{For highly social species, population dynamics depend on hierarchical
   demography that links local processes, group dynamics, and population
   growth. Here, we describe a stage-structured matrix model of
   hierarchical demography, which provides a framework for understanding
   social influences on population change. Our approach accounts for
   dispersal and affords insight into population dynamics at multiple
   scales. The method has close parallels to integral projection models but
   focuses on a discrete characteristic (group size). Using detailed
   long-term records for meerkats (Suricata suricatta), we apply our model
   to explore patterns of local density dependence and implications of
   group size for group and population growth. Taking into account
   dispersers, the model predicts a per capita growth rate for social
   groups that declines with group size. It predicts that larger social
   groups should produce a greater number of new breeding groups; thus,
   dominant breeding females (responsible for most reproduction) are likely
   to be more productive in larger groups. Considering the potential for
   future population growth, larger groups have the highest reproductive
   value, but per capita reproductive value is maximized for individuals in
   smaller groups. Across a plausible range of dispersal conditions,
   meerkats' long-run population growth rate is maximized when individuals
   form groups of intermediate size.}},

Title = {{Assessing Indirect Environmental Effects of Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT): A Systematic Literature Review}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Indirect environmental effects of information and communication
   technology (ICT) are those effects of ICT that change patterns of
   production or consumption in domains other than ICT, or more precisely,
   the environmental consequences of these changes. Digitalization as the
   societal process of ICT-driven change has created increasing interest in
   the indirect environmental effects of this technology. Assessments of
   indirect effects face various methodological challenges, such as the
   definition of the system boundary, the definition of a baseline as a
   reference or the occurrence of rebound effects. Existing studies use
   various approaches or methods to assess a spectrum of ICT use cases in
   several application domains. In view of the large number of assessments
   that have been conducted, the choices made when applying assessment
   methods, and the variety of ICT use cases in different application
   domains investigated, we present a systematic literature review of
   existing assessments of indirect environmental effects of ICT. The
   review provides a state-of-the-art overview of the methods used in the
   research field and is intended to support researchers in designing sound
   assessments which yield significant results. We identified 54 studies in
   seven main application domains using 15 different assessment approaches.
   The most common application domains are virtual mobility (e.g.,
   telecommuting), virtual goods (e.g., digital media), and smart transport
   (e.g., route optimization). Life-cycle assessment, partial footprint,
   and the ``ICT enablement method{''} are the most common approaches. The
   major part of the assessments focuses on patterns of production (e.g.,
   production of paper-based books vs. e-books), a smaller part on patterns
   of consumption (e.g., changes in media consumption). Based on these
   results, we identify as a research gap the investigation of ICT impacts
   on consumer behavior, which could, for example, focus on social
   practices, and account for the dynamic implications of change.
   Elaborating such an approach could provide valuable insights into ICT's
   impact on society and the resulting environmental consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Land cover maps are indispensable for decision making, monitoring, and
   management in agricultural areas, but they are often only available
   after harvesting. To obtain a timely crop map of a small-scale arable
   landscape in the Swiss Plateau, we acquired uncalibrated, very
   high-resolution data, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 m and four
   spectral bands, using a consumer-grade camera on an unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV) in June 2015. We resampled the data to different spatial
   and spectral resolutions, and evaluated the method using textural
   features (first order statistics and mathematical morphology), a random
   forest classifier for best performance, as well as number and size of
   the structuring elements. Our main findings suggest the overall best
   performing data consisting of a spatial resolution of 0.5 m, three
   spectral bands (RGBred, green, and blue), and five different sizes of
   the structuring elements. The overall accuracy (OA) for the full set of
   crop classes based on a pixel-based classification is 66.7\%. In case of
   a merged set of crops, the OA increases by similar to 7\% (74.0\%). For
   an object-based classification based on individual field parcels, the OA
   increases by similar to 20\% (OA of 86.3\% for the full set of crop
   classes, and 94.6\% for the merged set, respectively). We conclude the
   use of UAV to be most relevant at 0.5 m spatial resolution in
   heterogeneous arable landscapes when used for crop classification.}},

Abstract = {{The placement of angiosperms and Gnetales in seed plant phylogeny
   remains one of the most enigmatic problems in plant evolution, with
   morphological analyses (which have usually included fossils) and
   molecular analyses pointing to very distinct topologies. Almost all
   morphology-based phylogenies group angiosperms with Gnetales and certain
   extinct seed plant lineages, while most molecular phylogenies link
   Gnetales with conifers. In this study, we investigate the phylogenetic
   signal present in published seed plant morphological data sets. We use
   parsimony, Bayesian inference, and maximum-likelihood approaches,
   combined with a number of experiments with the data, to address the
   morphological-molecular conflict. First, we ask whether the lack of
   association of Gnetales with conifers in morphological analyses is due
   to an absence of signal or to the presence of competing signals, and
   second, we compare the performance of parsimony and model-based
   approaches with morphological data sets. Our results imply that the
   grouping of Gnetales and angiosperms is largely the result of
   long-branch attraction (LBA), consistent across a range of
   methodological approaches. Thus, there is a signal for the grouping of
   Gnetales with conifers in morphological matrices, but it was swamped by
   convergence between angiosperms and Gnetales, both situated on long
   branches. However, this effect becomes weaker in more recent analyses,
   as a result of addition and critical reassessment of characters. Even
   when a clade including angiosperms and Gnetales is still weakly
   supported by parsimony, model-based approaches favor a clade of Gnetales
   and conifers, presumably because they are more resistant to LBA.
   Inclusion of fossil taxa weakens rather than strengthens support for a
   relationship of angiosperms and Gnetales. Our analyses finally reconcile
   morphology with molecules in favoring a relationship of Gnetales to
   conifers, and show that morphology may therefore be useful in
   reconstructing other aspects of the phylogenetic history of the seed
   plants.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation is a highly dynamic component of the Earth surface and
   substantially alters the water cycle. Particularly the process of
   oxygenic plant photosynthesis determines vegetation connecting the water
   and carbon cycle and causing various interactions and feedbacks across
   Earth spheres. While vegetation impacts the water cycle, it reacts to
   changing water availability via functional, biochemical and structural
   responses. Unravelling the resulting complex feedbacks and interactions
   between the plant-water system and environmental change is essential for
   any modelling approaches and predictions, but still insufficiently
   understood due to currently missing observations. We hypothesize that an
   appropriate cross-scale monitoring of plant-water relations can be
   achieved by combined observational and modelling approaches. This paper
   reviews suitable remote sensing approaches to assess plant-water
   relations ranging from pure observational to combined
   observational-modelling approaches. We use a combined energy balance and
   radiative transfer model to assess the explanatory power of pure
   observational approaches focussing on plant parameters to estimate
   plant-water relations, followed by an outline for a more effective use
   of remote sensing by their integration into soil-plant-atmosphere
   continuum (SPAC) models. We apply a mechanistic model simulating water
   movement in the SPAC to reveal insight into the complexity of relations
   between soil, plant and atmospheric parameters, and thus plant-water
   relations. We conclude that future research should focus on strategies
   combining observations and mechanistic modelling to advance our
   knowledge on the interplay between the plant-water system and
   environmental change, e.g. through plant transpiration.}},

Abstract = {{In subgenus Decaloba (DC.) Rchb. of Passiflora L., the section Xerogona
   (Raf.) Killip (Passifloraceae) is a group of herbaceous vines found in
   subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas. Primarily distributed
   in Central America, with a few also found in the West Indies and South
   America, the species of Passiflora sect. Xerogona are recognized by
   their unusual dehiscent capsular fruit, the absence of bracts and
   laminar nectaries, and their transversely grooved seeds. Passiflora
   tenella Killip is the only species included in Passiflora sect. Xerogona
   with a fruit that does not appear to be a capsule, but the shape of the
   leaves and the absence of floral brat is and laminar nectaries suggest
   affiliation with this section. Fifteen species, including two
   subspecies, are recognized within Passiflora sect. Xerogona. Passiflora
   cobanensis Killip is distinguished as two subspecies, P. cobanensis
   subsp. cobanensis and P. cobanensis subsp. brevipes (Killip) T. Boza,
   with the latter subspecies transferred from P. brevipes Killip. From
   previous species circumscriptions, this section contains two problematic
   species complexes for P. capsularis L. and P. rubra L. The morphological
   variation between and within these two species complexes was examined in
   this study, using Principal Component Analysis and correlation matrices
   of morphological characters, and this variation was studied throughout
   their distributional ranges. Passiflora capsularis is recognized as a
   single variable species. Two species are recognized within the P. rubra
   complex, based primarily on floral characters, as P. cisnana Harms and
   P. rubra. Passiflara cisnana is lectotypified.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Carbon cycling responses of ecosystems to global warming will likely be
   stronger in cold ecosystems where many processes are
   temperature-limited. Predicting these effects is difficult because air
   and soil temperatures will not change in concert, and will affect above
   and belowground processes differently. We disentangled above and
   belowground temperature effects on plant C allocation and deposition of
   plant C in soils by independently manipulating air and soil temperatures
   in microcosms planted with either Leucanthemopsis alpina or Pinus mugo
   seedlings. Daily average temperatures of 4 or 9 degrees C were applied
   to shoots and independently to roots, and plants pulse-labelled with
   (CO2)-C-14. We traced soil CO2 and (CO2)-C-14 evolution for 4days, after
   which microcosms were destructively harvested and C-14 quantified in
   plant and soil fractions. In microcosms with L.alpina, net C-14 uptake
   was higher at 9 degrees C than at 4 degrees C soil temperature, and this
   difference was independent of air temperature. In warmer soils, more C
   was allocated to roots at greater soil depth, with no effect of air
   temperature. In P.mugo microcosms, assimilate partitioning to roots
   increased with air temperature, but only when soils were at 9 degrees C.
   Higher soil temperatures also increased the mean soil depth at which
   C-14 was allocated. Our findings highlight the dependence of C uptake,
   use, and partitioning on both air and soil temperature, with the latter
   being relatively more important. The strong temperature-sensitivity of C
   assimilate use in the roots and rhizosphere supports the hypothesis that
   cold limitation on C uptake is primarily mediated by reduced sink
   strength in the roots. We conclude that variations in soil rather than
   air temperature are going to drive plant responses to warming in cold
   environments, with potentially large changes in C cycling due to
   enhanced transfer of plant-derived C to soils.}},

Abstract = {{Fast tip-growing plant cells such as pollen tubes (PTs) and root hairs
   (RHs) require a robust coordination between their internal growth
   machinery and modifications of their extracellular rigid, yet
   extensible, cell wall (CW). Part of this essential coordination is
   governed by members of the Catharanthus roseus receptor-like
   kinase1-like (CrRLK1L) subfamily of RLKs with FERONIA (FER) and its
   closest homologs, ANXUR1 (ANX1) and ANX2, controlling CW integrity
   during RH and PT growth, respectively. Recently, Leucine-Rich Repeat
   Extensin 8 (LRX8) to LRX11 were also shown to be important for CW
   integrity in PTs. We previously reported an anx1 anx2 suppressor screen
   in Arabidopsis thaliana that revealed MARIS (MRI) as a positive
   regulator of both FER- and ANX1/2-dependent CW integrity pathways. Here,
   we characterize a suppressor that exhibits a weak rescue of the anx1
   anx2 PT bursting phenotype and a short RH phenotype. The corresponding
   suppressor mutation causes a D94N substitution in a Type One Protein
   Phosphatase we named ATUNIS1 (AUN1). We show that AUN1 and its closest
   homolog, AUN2, are nucleocytoplasmic negative regulators of tip growth.
   Moreover, we demonstrate that AUN1(D94N) and AUN1(H127A) harboring
   mutations in key amino acids of the conserved catalytic site of
   phosphoprotein phosphatases function as dominant amorphic variants that
   repress PT growth. Finally, genetic interaction studies using the
   hypermorph MRIR240C and amorph AUN1(D94N) dominant variants indicate
   that LRX8-11 and ANX1/2 function in distinct but converging pathways to
   fine-tune CW integrity during tip growth.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive explanations for dormancy often invoke bet hedging, where
   reduced mean fitness can be adaptive if it associates with reduced
   fitness variance. Sex allocation theory typically ignores variance
   effects and focuses on mean fitness. For many cyclical parthenogens,
   these themes become linked, as only sexually produced eggs undergo the
   dormancy needed to survive harsh conditions. We ask how sex allocation
   and the timing of sex evolve when this constraint exists in the form of
   a trade-off between asexual reproduction and sexual production of
   dormant eggs-the former being crucial for within-season success and the
   latter for survival across seasons. We show that male production can be
   temporally separated from or co-occur with sex, depending on whether
   direct (time) or indirect (population density) cues of the season's end
   are available and whether population growth is density dependent. Sex
   generally occurs late in the season but is induced earlier in
   unpredictable environments. When only indirect cues are available, the
   temporal spread of sex, and with it the production of dormant stages, is
   even larger and, given sufficient mortality, leads to endogenous
   population cycles in which frequent sex coincides with high densities.
   In all scenarios, algorithms maximizing geometric mean fitness have
   reduced fitness variance compared with a hypothetical non-bet hedger,
   confirming that the timing of male production and sex in facultative
   seasonal settings can be bet-hedging traits.}},

Journal = {{WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{635-649}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The lagg is an integral part of the hydrological system of a raised bog
   and can add significantly to the biological diversity of the ecosystem.
   Conservation and restoration of raised bogs should therefore involve
   this transition zone. The ideal situation for conservation is to protect
   or restore the natural lagg at the outside margin of the bog. However,
   it is not always possible to restore the lagg where it was historically
   situated. An analysis of historic maps of a raised bog in British
   Columbia, Canada, shows that in areas where the outflow of water from
   the bog has been impeded, lagg plant communities have naturally
   colonized parts of the bog that were historically open bog. This
   suggests that it is possible to create the ecohydrological conditions of
   a lagg in areas that are currently occupied by bog species. Based on
   this knowledge and the hydrochemical, hydrological, and vegetative
   characteristics of a regionally-specific lagg reference ecosystem, we
   describe several lagg restoration options for locations where it is not
   possible to restore the lagg at the outside margin of the bog.}},

Abstract = {{Because significant global changes are currently underway in the Arctic,
   creating a large-scale standardized database for Arctic marine
   biodiversity is particularly pressing. This study evaluates the
   potential of aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to detect
   Arctic coastal biodiversity changes and characterizes the local
   spatio-temporal distribution of eDNA in two locations. We extracted and
   amplified eDNA using two COI primer pairs from similar to 80 water
   samples that were collected across two Canadian Arctic ports, Churchill
   and Iqaluit, based on optimized sampling and preservation methods for
   remote regions surveys. Results demonstrate that aquatic eDNA surveys
   have the potential to document large-scale Arctic biodiversity change by
   providing a rapid overview of coastal metazoan biodiversity, detecting
   nonindigenous species, and allowing sampling in both open water and
   under the ice cover by local northern-based communities. We show that
   DNA sequences of similar to 50\% of known Canadian Arctic species and
   potential invaders are currently present in public databases. A similar
   proportion of operational taxonomic units was identified at the species
   level with eDNA metabarcoding, for a total of 181 species identified at
   both sites. Despite the cold and well-mixed coastal environment, species
   composition was vertically heterogeneous, in part due to river inflow in
   the estuarine ecosystem, and differed between the water column and tide
   pools. Thus, COI-based eDNA metabarcoding may quickly improve
   large-scale Arctic biomonitoring using eDNA, but we caution that aquatic
   eDNA sampling needs to be standardized over space and time to accurately
   evaluate community structure changes.}},

Abstract = {{Health literacy describes skills and competencies that enable people to
   gain access to, understand and apply health information to positively
   influence their own health and the health of those in their social
   environments. In an increasingly media saturated and digitized world,
   these skill sets are necessary for accessing and navigating sources of
   health information and tools, such as television, the Internet, and
   mobile apps. The concepts of Media Health Literacy (MHL) and eHealth
   Literacy (eHL) describe the specific competencies such tasks require.
   This article introduces the two concepts, and then reviews findings on
   the associations of MHL and eHL with several contextual variables in the
   social environment such as socio-demographics, social support, and
   system complexity, as a structural variable. As eHL and MHL are crucial
   for empowering people to actively engage in their own health, there is a
   growing body of literature reporting on the potential and the
   effectiveness of intervention initiatives to positively influence these
   competencies. From an ethical standpoint, equity is emphasized,
   stressing the importance of accessible media environments for
   allincluding those at risk of exclusion from (digital) media sources.
   Alignment of micro and macro contextual spheres will ultimately
   facilitate both non-digital and digital media to effectively support and
   promote public health.}},

Abstract = {{Indigenous peoples' participation in the co-management of protected
   areas is recognised as essential for conserving both cultural and
   biological diversity. While this practice is increasingly common, few
   studies have quantitatively evaluated the efficacy of these initiatives.
   Here we examine levels of knowledge and involvement among the Agta, a
   hunter-gatherer population who co-manage the Northern Sierra Madre
   Natural Park, the largest protected area in the Philippines. We find
   that the Agta generally possess low levels of knowledge about the
   protected area they are supposed to co-manage. Participation in park
   management is hampered by several factors, including a lack of cultural
   sensitivity regarding the Agta's foraging lifestyle among park officials
   and little political will to realistically empower and support the Agta
   as co-managers. Recommendations to strengthen Agta participation - and
   indigenous peoples' participation in protected area management more
   widely - are made to help protect the world's remaining cultural and
   biological diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Niche differentiation among species is supposed to be reflected in the
   distribution of trait values in communities. Yet, how species-specific
   trait expression responds to changing plant diversity and how these
   changes affect community-level trait distributions is less clear. We
   used monocultures and mixtures of a large biodiversity experiment (Jena
   Experiment) to evaluate this question. We applied additive partitioning
   of net biodiversity effects (NE) into complementarity (CE) and selection
   effects (SE) to community-weighted trait means (CWM). Between 60-100\%
   of NEs on CWMs (i.e. their deviation from the abundance-weighted means
   of monoculture trait values) were explained by CEs indicating that trait
   plasticity of different species contributed to shifts in CWMs. Positive
   CEs for shoot-architectural traits, tissue elemental concentrations and
   specific leaf area (SLA) indicated on-average higher values of these
   traits in the mixtures, while negative SEs in these traits suggested
   that dominant species showed the opposite response to the
   mixture-environment. Trait plasticity in response to mixture growth
   conditions increased species-level trait deviation from CWMs in several
   traits related to structural stability and SLA, while species-level
   deviation in shoot length from CWMs decreased. Community-wide occupation
   of trait space (range and variance of trait values) increased with plant
   diversity. Trait plasticity in response to the mixture-environment
   reduced the occupied trait space in several size-related traits, while
   it increased trait space in SLA. Measures of trait-based niche
   differentiation did not change (kurtosis, i.e. ``peakedness{''} of trait
   distribution) or decreased (standard deviation of nearest neighbour
   distances, SDNN) at increased species richness, indicating that
   plasticity did not reduce niche overlap. Our results suggest that fixed
   trait differences among species primarily explain the greater extent and
   denser filling of community trait space at increased plant diversity.
   Species-specific trait plasticity in response to increased plant
   diversity does not increase community-wide trait space or decrease niche
   overlap between species.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic dines offer insights about putative targets and agents of
   natural selection as well as tempo and mode of adaptation. However,
   demographic processes can lead to dines that are indistinguishable from
   adaptive divergence. Using the widespread yellow dung fly Scathophaga
   stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae), we examine quantitative genetic
   differentiation (Q(ST)) of wing shape across North America, Europe, and
   Japan, and compare this differentiation with that of ten microsatellites
   (F-ST). Morphometric analyses of 28 populations reared at three
   temperatures revealed significant thermal plasticity, sexual dimorphism,
   and geographic differentiation in wing shape. In North America
   morphological differentiation followed the decline in microsatellite
   variability along the presumed route of recent colonization from the
   southeast to the northwest. Across Europe, where S. stercoraria
   presumably existed for much longer time and where no molecular pattern
   of isolation by distance was evident, clinal variation was less
   pronounced despite significant morphological differentiation (Q(ST)
   >F-ST). Shape vector comparisons further indicate that thermal
   plasticity (hot-to-cold) does not mirror patterns of latitudinal
   divergence (south-to-north), as might have been expected under a
   scenario with temperature as the major agent of selection. Our findings
   illustrate the importance of detailed phylogeographic information when
   interpreting geographic dines of dispersal traits in an adaptive
   evolutionary framework.}},

Abstract = {{Monetary valuation of dryland ecosystem services may help to increase
   the salience of drylands in decision making. Yet, there is no
   comprehensive assessment of the indicators that determine the estimated
   monetary values for dryland ecosystem services (hereafter: dryland
   value). Having compiled a database consisting of 559 observations from
   66 valuation studies in drylands worldwide, this study analyzes the
   relative importance of local socio-economic, environmental and
   methodological indicators in explaining the monetary value estimates for
   nine dryland ecosystem services by means of a multiple regression
   analysis. By explicitly quantifying the effect sizes of the indicators
   of dryland value, we shed new light on the driving forces behind
   monetary valuation of dryland ecosystem services. Our results show that
   local socio-economic and environmental conditions are marginal in
   explaining dryland value, indicating that local dryland conditions are
   not sufficiently captured with current valuation approaches.
   Simultaneously, we find that methodological factors, including valuation
   method and study extent, heavily influence dryland value, suggesting
   that monetary valuation outcomes are largely determined by the selected
   methodology. This emphasizes the need to improve monetary valuation
   methods so that they better capture local dryland conditions in order to
   be able to serve as a meaningful tool for decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Fusarium head blight is one of the most noxious cereal diseases.
   Worldwide, F. graminearum (FG) and the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is
   the most dominant species/mycotoxin in barley and wheat. Barley is often
   produced as on farm feed and thus routine mycotoxin analyses similar to
   those of cereals for human consumption are not performed. Hence, an
   early prediction of mycotoxin levels is important for farmers to
   minimise the risk of contaminated feed but also of contaminated cereals
   entering the cereal supply chain. Therefore, climate chamber experiments
   with artificial FG infection of barley investigating the influence of
   different temperatures (10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C) and
   durations (4 h, 8 h, 12 h) at 99\% relative humidity were conducted to
   accumulate data to develop a forecasting system. An up to three times
   higher DON contamination in the 15 degrees C treatments for the feed
   barley variety Ascona was detected compared with the 10 degrees C and 20
   degrees C treatments. For the malting barley variety Concerto, the
   prolonged humidity durations had a stronger effect under all tested
   temperatures and resulted in up to two times higher DON contaminations.
   In addition, field experiments where spore deposition during anthesis as
   well as disease incidence, fungal amount and mycotoxins were observed,
   showed that the overwintered straw treatment resulted, depending on the
   year, in a three times higher FG incidence and DON content compared with
   the control and freshly inoculated straw treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Malate dehydrogenases (MDHs) convert malate to oxaloacetate using NAD(H)
   or NADP(H) as a cofactor. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking
   plastidial NAD-dependent MDH (pdnad-mdh) are embryo-lethal, and
   constitutive silencing (miR-mdh-1) causes a pale, dwarfed phenotype. The
   reason for these severe phenotypes is unknown. Here, we rescued the
   embryo lethality of pdnad-mdh via embryo-specific expression of
   pdNAD-MDH. Rescued seedlings developed white leaves with aberrant
   chloroplasts and failed to reproduce. Inducible silencing of pdNAD-MDH
   at the rosette stage also resulted in white newly emerging leaves. These
   data suggest that pdNAD-MDH is important for early plastid development,
   which is consistent with the reductions in major plastidial
   galactolipid, carotenoid, and protochlorophyllide levels in miR-mdh-1
   seedlings. Surprisingly, the targeting of other NAD-dependent MDH
   isoforms to the plastid did not complement the embryo lethality of
   pdnad-mdh, while expression of enzymatically inactive pdNAD-MDH did.
   These complemented plants grew indistinguishably from the wild type.
   Both active and inactive forms of pdNAD-MDH interact with a heteromeric
   AAA-ATPase complex at the inner membrane of the chloroplast envelope.
   Silencing the expression of FtsH12, a key member of this complex,
   resulted in a phenotype that strongly resembles miR-mdh-1. We propose
   that pdNAD-MDH is essential for chloroplast development due to its
   moonlighting role in stabilizing FtsH12, distinct from its enzymatic
   function.}},

Abstract = {{Historical contingency broadly refers to the proposition that even
   random historical events can constrain the ecological and evolutionary
   pathways of organisms and that of entire communities. Focusing on
   communities, these pathways can be reflected into specific structural
   changes within and across trophic levels - how species interact with and
   affect each other - which has important consequences for species
   coexistence. Using the registry of the last 2000 years of plant
   introductions and their novel herbivores encountered in Central Europe,
   we find that the order of arrival of closely related (but not of
   distantly related) plant species constrained the structural changes
   within the trophic level formed by herbivore species across the
   observation period. Because it is difficult for field and lab
   experiments to be conducted over hundreds of years to record and replay
   the assembly history of a community, our study provides an alternative
   to understand how structural changes have occurred across extensive
   periods of time.}},

Abstract = {{Cold-adapted taxa are experiencing severe range shifts due to climate
   change and are expected to suffer a significant reduction of their
   climatically suitable habitats in the next few decades. However, it has
   been proposed that taxa with sufficient standing genetic and ecologic
   diversity will better withstand climate change. These taxa are typically
   more broadly distributed in geographic and ecological niche space,
   therefore they are likely to endure higher levels of populations loss
   than more restricted, less diverse taxa before the effects of those
   losses impact their overall diversity and resilience. Here, we explore
   the potential relationship between intraspecific genetic and ecological
   diversity and future resilience, using the cold-adapted plant Primula
   farinosa. We employ high-throughput sequencing to assess the genomic
   diversity of phylogeographic lineages in P. farinosa. Additionally, we
   use current climatic variables to define niche breadth and niche
   differentiation across lineages. Finally, we calibrate species
   distribution models (SDMs) and project the climatic preferences of each
   lineage on future climate to predict lineage-specific shifts in
   climatically suitable habitats. Our study predicts relative persistence
   of future suitable habitats for the most genetically and ecologically
   diverse lineages of the cold-adapted P. farinosa, but significant
   reduction of them for two out of its four lineages. While we do not
   provide specific experiments aimed at identifying the causal links
   between genetic diversity and resilience to climate change, our results
   indicate that greater genetic diversity and wider ecological breadth may
   buffer species responses to rapid climatic changes. This study further
   highlights the importance of integrating knowledge of intraspecific
   diversity for predicting species fate in response to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The increased use of digital information and communications technologies
   (ICT) is giving rise to fast-growing waste streams that contain
   important material resources. In contrast to bulk materials and precious
   metals, the recovery of most critical metals has not yet been
   commercially established, and they are thus lost within the recycling
   process. In this article, we used dynamic material flow analysis to
   explore the stocks and flows of indium, neodymium, and gold incorporated
   in end-user devices in Switzerland. Our analysis covered the use,
   collection, recycling, and disposal phases. This enabled us to track the
   three metals from their entry into Switzerland as components of new
   devices until their recovery, disposal in landfills, or dissipation to
   the environment. Using statistical entropy analysis (SEA), we further
   analyzed the dilution or concentration of the metals during their route
   through the current system. The data uncertainty was addressed employing
   a probabilistic approach. The largest quantities of all three metals are
   found in the devices currently in use. The second-largest stocks are
   slags disposed in landfills for indium, slags used for construction for
   neodymium, and the output of metal recovery processes for gold. The SEA
   illustrates how the current collection and recycling system successfully
   concentrates all three metals. While 70\% of gold leaving the use phase
   is recovered, indium and neodymium are dissipated to slags after
   smelting and incineration processes due to the lack of economic
   incentives and lacking recovery processes on a commercial scale.}},

Abstract = {{Sex is ancestral in eukaryotes. Meiotic sex differs from bacterial ways
   of exchanging genetic material by involving the fusion of two cells. We
   examine the hypothesis that fusion evolved in early eukaryotes because
   it was directly beneficial, rather than a passive side effect of meiotic
   sex. We assume that the uptake of (proto)mitochondria into eukaryotes
   preceded the evolution of cell fusion and that Muller's ratchet
   operating within symbiont lineages led to the accumulation of
   lineage-specific sets of mutations in asexual host cells. We examine
   whether cell fusion, and the consequent biparental inheritance of
   symbionts, helps to mitigate the effects of this mutational meltdown of
   mitochondria. in our model, host cell fitness improves when two
   independently evolved mitochondrial strains co-inhabit a single
   cytoplasm, mirroring mitochondrial complementation found in modern
   eukaryotes. If fusion incurs no cost, we find that an allele coding for
   fusion can invade a population of nonfusers. If fusion is costly, there
   are two thresholds. The first describes a maximal fusing rate
   (probability of fusion per round of cell division) that is able to fix.
   An allele that codes for a rate above this threshold can reach a
   polymorphic equilibrium with nonfusers, as long as the rate is below the
   second threshold, above which the fusion allele is counter-selected.
   Whenever it evolves, fusion increases the population-wide level of
   heteroplasmy, which allows mitochondrial complementation and increases
   population fitness. We conclude that beneficial interactions between
   mitochondria are a potential factor that selected for cell fusion in
   early eukaryotes.}},

   plants with a monoculture selection history. Biodiversity effects were
   generally positive and differed significantly between selection
   histories. However, contrary to our expectations, biodiversity effects
   were not stronger for mixture-type plants. Biodiversity effects were
   influenced by both trait differences between plants and
   community-weighted means, but these relationships were mostly
   independent of selection history. Our findings suggest that twelve years
   of selection history in monocultures or species mixtures differentiated
   plants of each species into monoculture-and mixture-types. Such rapid
   evolution of different community-types within grassland species and its
   effect on ecosystem services and functioning are likely to be important
   for species conservation practice.}},

   Suggests a Role for Jasmonates in Coping With Drought}},

Abstract = {{Although often investigated within the context of plant growth and
   development and/or seed composition, plant lipids have roles in
   responses to environment. To dissect changes in lipid and fatty acid
   composition linked to drought tolerance responses in oats, we performed
   a detailed profiling of (>90) different lipids classes during a time
   course of water stress. We used two oat cultivars, Flega and Patones
   previously characterized as susceptible and tolerant to drought,
   respectively. Significant differences in lipid classes (mono, di and
   triacylglycerols; {[}respectively MAG, DAG, and TAG] and free fatty
   acids {[}FFA]) and in their fatty acid (FA) composition was observed
   between cultivars upon drought stress. In Flega there was an increase of
   saturated FAs, in particular 16: 0 in the DAG and TAG fractions. This
   led to significant lower values of the double bond index and
   polyunsaturated/saturated ratio in Flega compared with Patones. By
   contrast, Patones was characterized by the early induction of
   signaling-related lipids and fatty acids, such as DAGs and linolenic
   acid. Since the latter is a precursor of jasmonates, we investigated
   further changes of this signaling molecule. Targeted measurements of
   jasmonic acid (JA) and Ile-JA indicated early increases in the
   concentrations of these molecules in Patones upon drought stress whereas
   no changes were observed in Flega. Altogether, these data suggest a role
   for jasmonates and specific fatty acids in different lipid classes in
   coping with drought stress in oat.}},

Volume = {{285}},
Number = {{1883}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{Archaeological dental calculus has emerged as a rich source of ancient
   biomolecules, including proteins. Previous analyses of proteins
   extracted from ancient dental calculus revealed the presence of the
   dietary milk protein beta-lactoglobulin, providing direct evidence of
   dairy consumption in the archaeological record. However, the potential
   for calculus to preserve other food-related proteins has not yet been
   systematically explored. Here we analyse shotgun metaproteomic data from
   100 archaeological dental calculus samples ranging from the Iron Age to
   the post-medieval period (eighth century BC to nineteenth century AD) in
   England, as well as 14 dental calculus samples from contemporary dental
   patients and recently deceased individuals, to characterize the range
   and extent of dietary proteins preserved in dental calculus. In addition
   to milk proteins, we detect proteomic evidence of foodstuffs such as
   cereals and plant products, as well as the digestive enzyme salivary
   amylase. We discuss the importance of optimized protein extraction
   methods, data analysis approaches and authentication strategies in the
   identification of dietary proteins from archaeological dental calculus.
   This study demonstrates that proteomic approaches can robustly identify
   foodstuffs in the archaeological record that are typically
   under-represented due to their poor macroscopic preservation.}},

   Micro-Geographic Scale}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic bases underlying climate adaptation is a key
   element to predict the potential of species to face climate warming.
   Although substantial climate variation is observed at a micro-geographic
   scale, most genomic maps of climate adaptation have been established at
   broader geographical scales. Here, by using a Pool-Seq approach combined
   with a Bayesian hierarchical model that control for confounding by
   population structure, we performed a genome-environment association
   (GEA) analysis to investigate the genetic basis of adaptation to six
   climate variables in 168 natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana
   distributed in south-west of France. Climate variation among the 168
   populations represented up to 24\% of climate variation among 521
   European locations where A. thaliana inhabits. We identified neat and
   strong peaks of association, with most of the associated SNPs being
   significantly enriched in likely functional variants and/or in the
   extreme tail of genetic differentiation among populations. Furthermore,
   genes involved in transcriptional mechanisms appear predominant in plant
   functions associated with local climate adaptation. Globally, our
   results suggest that climate adaptation is an important driver of
   genomic variation in A. thaliana at a small spatial scale and mainly
   involves genome-wide changes in fundamental mechanisms of gene
   regulation. The identification of climate-adaptive genetic loci at a
   micro-geographic scale also highlights the importance to include
   within-species genetic diversity in ecological niche models for
   projecting potential species distributional shifts over short geographic
   distances.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in climate, land use and management have led to an increase in
   woody species encroachment into grasslands, threatening key ecosystem
   services and resilience. This study uses dendroecological techniques to
   investigate acclimation strategies of two native woody species,
   Juniperus virginiana and Pinus ponderosa, to spatial and temporal
   variability in precipitation and stand density in Nebraska (NE). Two
   locations in Eastern NE and one in Western NE, were selected and tree
   cores for ring-width measurements were collected. Stable Isotope ratios
   of carbon were analysed to investigate water use efficiency (WUE), and
   stable isotope ratios of oxygen were used to understand stomatal
   conductance and control. Our results showed trees in dense stands
   exhibited less intra-specific variability in response to climate and
   narrower tree rings than sparse open stands, with P. ponderosa being
   more responsive to density and climate variability than J. virginiana.
   Populations in the drier Sandhills grasslands of Western NE were more
   dependent on intra- and inter-annual precipitation and generally more
   impacted by drought events than those in the East. Eastern NE trees were
   less limited by drought and displayed lower WIT relative to Western
   location, even though temperatures were slightly higher, but this was
   compensated for by the overall higher precipitation levels in the East.
   Generally, above average winter temperatures were positively correlated
   with ring widths, while temperature extremes during the growing season
   were negatively correlated. Although years of extreme drought events
   were visible in the tree-ring width patterns for both species
   independent of stand density and location, it seems that once the trees
   are established and have access to soil moisture, the current climate
   variability and extremes in NE do not limit or cause a permanent it
   decline in growth of either species.}},

Abstract = {{1. The network of minor veins of angiosperm leaves may include loops
   (reticulation). Variation in network architecture has been hypothesized
   to have hydraulic and also structural and defensive functions.
   2. We measured venation network trait space in eight dimensions for 136
   biomass-dominant angiosperm tree species along a 3,300 m elevation
   gradient in southeastern Peru. We then examined the relative importance
   of multiple ecological and evolutionary predictors of reticulation.
   3. Variation in minor venation network reticulation was constrained to
   three axes. These axes described reconnecting vs. branching veins,
   elongated vs. compact areoles compact vs. elongated and low vs.
   high-density veins. Variation in the first two axes was predicted by
   traits related to mechanical strength and secondary compounds, and in
   the third axis by site temperature.
   4. Synthesis. Defensive and structural factors primarily explain
   variation in multiple axes of reticulation, with a smaller role for
   climate-linked factors. These results suggest that venation network
   reticulation may be determined more by species interactions than by
   hydraulic functions.}},

Abstract = {{Leaf fluorescence can be used to track plant development and stress, and
   is considered the most direct measurement of photosynthetic activity
   available from remote sensing techniques. Red and far-red sun-induced
   chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) maps were generated from high spatial
   resolution images collected with the HyPlant airborne spectrometer over
   even-aged loblolly pine plantations in North Carolina (United States).
   Canopy fluorescence yield (i.e., the fluorescence flux normalized by the
   light absorbed) in the red and far-red peaks was computed. This
   quantifies the fluorescence emission efficiencies that are more directly
   linked to canopy function compared to SIF radiances. Fluorescence fluxes
   and yields were investigated in relation to tree age to infer new
   insights on the potential of those measurements in better describing
   ecosystem processes. The results showed that red fluorescence yield
   varies with stand age. Young stands exhibited a nearly twofold higher
   red fluorescence yield than mature forest plantations, while the far-red
   fluorescence yield remained constant. We interpreted this finding in a
   context of photosynthetic stomatal limitation in aging loblolly pine
   stands. Current and future satellite missions provide global datasets of
   SIF at coarse spatial resolution, resulting in intrapixel mixture
   effects, which could be a confounding factor for fluorescence signal
   interpretation. To mitigate this effect, we propose a surrogate of the
   fluorescence yield, namely the Canopy Cover Fluorescence Index (CCFI)
   that accounts for the spatial variability in canopy structure by
   exploiting the vegetation fractional cover. It was found that spatial
   aggregation tended to mask the effective relationships, while the CCFI
   was still able to maintain this link. This study is a first attempt in
   interpreting the fluorescence variability in aging forest stands and it
   may open new perspectives in understanding long-term forest dynamics in
   response to future climatic conditions from remote sensing of SIF.}},

Abstract = {{The desiccation-tolerant plant Haberlea rhodopensis can withstand months
   of darkness without any visible senescence. Here, we investigated the
   molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) darkness and
   subsequent return to light. H. rhodopensis plants remained green and
   viable throughout the dark treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed
   that darkness regulated several transcription factor (TF) genes.
   Stress-and autophagy-related TFs such as ERF8, HSFA2b, RD26, TGA1, and
   WRKY33 were up-regulated, while chloroplast-and flowering-related TFs
   such as ATH1, COL2, COL4, RL1, and PTAC7 were repressed. PHYTOCHROME
   INTERACTING FACTOR4, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and
   promoter of senescence, also was down-regulated. In response to
   darkness, most of the photosynthesis-and photorespiratory-related genes
   were strongly down-regulated, while genes related to autophagy were
   up-regulated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE
   NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes,
   which regulate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy.
   Most of the genes associated with chlorophyll catabolism, which are
   induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either unregulated
   (PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED CHLOROPHYLL CATABOLITE REDUCTASE,
   RCCR) or repressed (STAY GREEN-LIKE, PHEOPHYTINASE, and NON-YELLOW
   COLORING1). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of
   many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein degradation.
   In darkness, levels of the chloroplastic lipids
   digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol,
   phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while
   those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting degradation of
   chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for
   use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a
   coordinated response to darkness, including repression of
   photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and chlorophyll catabolic
   genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic
   reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.}},

Abstract = {{The extensive use of traits in ecological studies over the last few
   decades to predict community functions has revealed that plant traits
   are plastic and respond to various environmental factors. These plant
   traits are assumed to predict how plants compete and capture resources.
   Variation in stoichiometric ratios both within and across species
   reflects resource capture dynamics under competition. However, the
   impact of local plant diversity on species-specific stoichiometry
   remains poorly studied. Here, we analyze how spatial and temporal
   diversity in resource-acquisition traits affects leaf elemental
   stoichiometry of plants (i.e. the result of resource capture) and how
   flexible this stoichiometry is depending on the functional composition
   of the surrounding community. Therefore, we assessed inter- and
   intraspecific variations of leaf carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and
   phosphorus (P) (and their ratios) of 20 grassland species in a large
   trait-based plant diversity experiment located in Jena (Germany) by
   measuring leaf elemental concentrations at the species-level along a
   gradient in plant trait dissimilarity. Our results show that plants
   showed large intra- and interspecific variation in leaf stoichiometry,
   which was only partly explained by the functional group identity (grass
   or herb) of the species. Elemental concentrations (N, P, but not C)
   decreased with plant species richness, and species tended to become more
   deviant from their monoculture stoichiometry with increasing trait
   dissimilarity in the community. These responses differed among species,
   some consistently increased or decreased in P and N concentrations; for
   other species, the negative or positive change in P and N concentrations
   increased with increasing trait difference between the target species
   and the remaining community. The strength of this relationship was
   significantly associated to the relative position of the species along
   trait gradients related to resource acquisition. Trait-difference and
   trait-diversity thus were important predictors of how species' resource
   capture changed in competitive neighbourhoods.}},

Abstract = {{The transition zone from the tropics to the subtropics in Mexico is an
   outstanding and poorly explored area of biotic overlap, and as such very
   interesting to evaluate how species richness patterns change in the
   latitudinal context. In order to assess alpha diversity patterns of
   ferns in this zone, we analyzed changes in their assemblages along an
   elevational gradient from 300 m to 3,000 m in the Sierra de Juarez,
   Oaxaca, and compared the results with similar studies conducted in
   Central and South America. We report the most detailed plot-based
   elevational gradient study on ferns in the region and provide detailed
   data on species abundances and elevational ranges. In 121 plots of 20 x
   20 m, we found 195 fern species, with the highest species numbers
   recorded at mid-elevations (1,100-2,200 m) and lower richness at both
   gradient extremes. This hump-shaped pattern was mainly driven by
   epiphytes, which contributed about 40\% to the total species richness
   and had wider elevational ranges than terrestrial species, which
   contributed 38\% to the total richness, and were more or less constant
   at low to mid elevations about 2,500 m, followed by a gradual decline.
   Overall, richness per plot was low compared to other elevational
   gradients within the tropics closer to the Equator. This decline of
   species richness towards the subtropics and temperate regions appears to
   be rather abrupt within Central America, but additional data are needed
   to close the remaining gap of knowledge between Costa Rica and Mexico.}},

Title = {{Predicted Mercury Soil Concentrations from a Kriging Approach for
   Improved Human Health Risk Assessment}},

Abstract = {{Health-risks from contaminated soils are assessed all over the world. An
   aspect that many risk assessments share is the heterogeneity in the
   distribution of contaminants. In a preceding study, we assessed
   potential health-risks for mothers and children living on
   mercury-contaminated soils in Switzerland using human
   biomonitoring-values (HBM) and soil samples. We assessed 64 mothers and
   107 children who had resided in a defined area for at least 3 months.
   HBM-concentrations for mercury in urine and hair were measured, a
   detailed questionnaire was administered for each individual, and more
   than 4000 individual mercury soil values were obtained in 2015. In this
   study, we aimed at investigating possible associations of mercury soil-
   and HBM-values by re-analyzing our data, using predictions of the
   mercury concentrations at the exact location of the participant's homes
   with a kriging approach. Although kriging proved to be a useful method
   to predict mercury soil concentrations, we did not detect an association
   between mercury soil- and HBM-values, in agreement with earlier
   findings. Benefits of geostatistical methods seem to be limited in the
   context of our study. Conclusions made in our preceding study about
   potential health risks for the residential population are robust and not
   altered by the current study.}},

Title = {{Understanding Forest Health with Remote Sensing, Part III: Requirements
   for a Scalable Multi-Source Forest Health Monitoring Network Based on
   Data Science Approaches}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},

Abstract = {{Forest ecosystems fulfill a whole host of ecosystem functions that are
   essential for life on our planet. However, an unprecedented level of
   anthropogenic influences is reducing the resilience and stability of our
   forest ecosystems as well as their ecosystem functions. The
   relationships between drivers, stress, and ecosystem functions in forest
   ecosystems are complex, multi-faceted, and often non-linear, and yet
   forest managers, decision makers, and politicians need to be able to
   make rapid decisions that are data-driven and based on short and
   long-term monitoring information, complex modeling, and analysis
   approaches. A huge number of long-standing and standardized forest
   health inventory approaches already exist, and are increasingly
   integrating remote-sensing based monitoring approaches. Unfortunately,
   these approaches in monitoring, data storage, analysis, prognosis, and
   assessment still do not satisfy the future requirements of information
   and digital knowledge processing of the 21st century. Therefore, this
   paper discusses and presents in detail five sets of requirements,
   including their relevance, necessity, and the possible solutions that
   would be necessary for establishing a feasible multi-source forest
   health monitoring network for the 21st century. Namely, these
   requirements are: (1) understanding the effects of multiple stressors on
   forest health; (2) using remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor
   forest health; (3) coupling different monitoring approaches; (4) using
   data science as a bridge between complex and multidimensional big forest
   health (FH) data; and (5) a future multi-source forest health monitoring
   network. It became apparent that no existing monitoring approach,
   technique, model, or platform is sufficient on its own to monitor,
   model, forecast, or assess forest health and its resilience. In order to
   advance the development of a multi-source forest health monitoring
   network, we argue that in order to gain a better understanding of forest
   health in our complex world, it would be conducive to implement the
   concepts of data science with the components: (i) digitalization; (ii)
   standardization with metadata management after the FAIR (Findability,
   Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles; (iii)
   Semantic Web; (iv) proof, trust, and uncertainties; (v) tools for data
   science analysis; and (vi) easy tools for scientists, data managers, and
   stakeholders for decision-making support.}},

Abstract = {{Mapping plants traits on theQinghai-Tibetan Plateau grassland is
   important for understanding ecosystem functions and how plants respond
   to global change. Detailed trait maps for the complete Qinghai-Tibetan
   Plateau are missing. Here, we addressed this issue by combining
   Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 multispectral satellite data with field
   measurements to map and compare plant traits of meadow and steppe
   communities across the complete Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We measured
   in-situ plant-level traits of CHLorophyll content (CHL), specific plant
   area (SPA = plant area / plant dry mass), and plant dry matter content
   (PDMC = plant dry mass / fresh mass). We hypothesized that plant-level
   traits of SPA and PDMC are close to community-weighted means (CWMs) of
   specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) because
   leaves represent the largest fraction of above-ground biomass in the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau grasslands. Despite vastly different measurement
   methods, we found that the remotely sensed traits (SPA and PDMC)
   correlated with literature-derived leaf traits of CWMs of SLA and LDMC.
   Both remotely sensed and field-measured results showed that alpine
   meadow plants reveal a wider range and higher averages of CHL and SPA
   but lower PDMC compared with alpine steppe plants. These trait
   differences between vegetation types indicate faster growth of alpine
   meadow and higher resilience to harsh conditions of alpine steppe,
   representing differences in adaptation strategies to environmental
   conditions. Our study demonstrates that remote sensing can be used to
   estimate plant traits in alpine grasslands with potential applications
   to retrieve functional diversity and correlated ecosystem functions in
   future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative approaches to predator-prey interactions are central to
   understanding the structure of food webs and their dynamics. Different
   predatory strategies may influence the occurrence and strength of
   trophic interactions likely affecting the rates and magnitudes of energy
   and nutrient transfer between trophic levels and stoichiometry of
   predator-prey interactions. Here, we used spider-prey interactions as a
   model system to investigate whether different spider web
   architecturesorb, tangle, and sheet-tangleaffect the composition and
   diet breadth of spiders and whether these, in turn, influence
   stoichiometric relationships between spiders and their prey. Our results
   showed that web architecture partially affects the richness and
   composition of the prey captured by spiders. Tangle-web spiders were
   specialists, capturing a restricted subset of the prey community
   (primarily Diptera), whereas orb and sheet-tangle web spiders were
   generalists, capturing a broader range of prey types. We also observed
   elemental imbalances between spiders and their prey. In general, spiders
   had higher requirements for both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) than
   those provided by their prey even after accounting for prey biomass.
   Larger P imbalances for tangle-web spiders than for orb and sheet-tangle
   web spiders suggest that trophic specialization may impose strong
   elemental constraints for these predators unless they display behavioral
   or physiological mechanisms to cope with nutrient limitation. Our
   findings suggest that integrating quantitative analysis of species
   interactions with elemental stoichiometry can help to better understand
   the occurrence of stoichiometric imbalances in predator-prey
   interactions.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{1. Plant resource partitioning is a mechanism promoting species
   coexistence and ecosystem functioning. Yet, we still have limited
   understanding of how soil microbes, especially plant symbiotic microbes,
   influence resource partitioning. We hypothesized that soil-borne
   microbes, in particular mycorrhizal fungi, facilitate differential
   performance of tree species depending on different nitrogen sources and
   that this leads to a positive plant diversity-community productivity
   relationship.
   2. We conducted two complementing glasshouse experiments. In a
   monoculture experiment, we supplied nitrogen as ammonium, nitrate or
   glycine and tested the growth response of three tree species associated
   with different root symbionts: one associated with ectomycorrhizal
   fungi, one associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and the third
   associated with both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and N-fixing bacteria.
   In an intermixed experiment, we grew the tree species at three richness
   levels (one, two or three species) in soil supplied with a mix of the
   three nitrogen forms or no added nitrogen, and with or without soil
   microbes.
   3. The monoculture experiment showed that in the presence of soil
   microbes, the ectomycorrhizal plant species grew best when supplied with
   glycine and the two arbuscular mycorrhizal plant species grew best with
   either nitrate or ammonium addition. When the different forms of
   nitrogen were mixed in the intermixed experiment, plant mixtures
   produced more biomass than plant monocultures in the presence of soil
   microbes, with positive complementarity effects indicating
   microbe-mediated plant resource partitioning.
   4. Our results suggest that co-existing tree species can partition soil
   nitrogen when grown with their particular mycorrhizal symbionts or other
   soil microbes, resulting in positive biodiversity effects in complex
   resource environments.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain ranges are amongst the most species-rich habitats, with many
   large and rapid evolutionary radiations. The tempo and mode of
   diversification in these systems are key unanswered questions in
   evolutionary biology. Here we study the Andean Lupinus radiation to
   understand the processes driving very rapid diversification in montane
   systems.
   We use genomic and transcriptomic data of multiple species and
   populations, and apply phylogenomic and demographic analyses to test
   whether diversification proceeded without interspecific gene flow - as
   expected if Andean orogeny and geographic isolation were the main
   drivers of diversification - or if diversification was accompanied by
   gene flow,in which case other processes were probably involved.
   We uncover several episodes of gene flow between species, including very
   recent events likely to have been prompted by changes in habitat
   connectivity during Pleistocene glacial cycles. Furthermore, we find
   that gene flow between species was heterogeneously distributed across
   the genome.
   We argue that exceptionally fast diversification of Andean Lupinus was
   partly a result of Late Pleistocene glacial cycles, with associated
   cycles of expansion and contraction driving geographic isolation or
   secondary contact of species. Furthermore, heterogeneous gene flow
   across the genome suggests a role for selection and ecological
   speciation in rapid diversification in this system.}},

Abstract = {{Clinal variation in body size and related life history traits is common
   and has stimulated the postulation of several eco-geographical rules.
   Whereas some clinal patterns are clearly adaptive, the causes of others
   remain obscure. We investigated intra-specific body size, development
   time and female fecundity (egg size and number) clines across 13
   European populations of the dung fly Sepsis fulgens spanning 20A degrees
   latitude from southern Italy to Estonia in a genetic common garden
   approach. Despite very short generation times (ca. 2 weeks at 24 A
   degrees C), we found a converse Bergmann cline (smaller size at higher
   latitudes). As development time did not change with latitude (flat
   cline), integral growth rate thus likely declines towards the pole. At
   the same time, early fecundity, but not egg size, increased with
   latitude. Rather than being mediated by seasonal time constraints, the
   body size reduction in the northernmost flies from Estonia could suggest
   that these are marginal, edge populations, as when omitting them the
   body size cline became flat as well. Most of the other sepsid species
   investigated to date also show flat body size clines, a pattern that
   strikingly differs from Drosophila. We conclude that S. fulgens life
   history traits appear to be shaped by similar environmental pressures
   and selective mechanisms across Europe, be they adaptive or not. This
   reiterates the suggestion that body size clines can result as a
   secondary consequence of selection pressures shaping an entire life
   history syndrome, rendering them inconsistent and unpredictable in
   general.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing biodiversity has been linked to higher primary productivity
   in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the underlying ecophysiological
   mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of
   surrounding species richness (monoculture, two- and four-species
   mixtures) on the ecophysiology of Lithocarpus glaber seedlings in
   experimental plots in subtropical China. A natural rain event
   isotopically labelled both the water uptaken by the L.glaber seedlings
   and the carbon in new photoassimilates through changes of photosynthetic
   discrimination. We followed the labelled carbon (C) and oxygen (O) in
   the plant-soil-atmosphere continuum. We measured gas-exchange variables
   (C assimilation, transpiration and above- and belowground respiration)
   and C-13 in leaf biomass, phloem, soil microbial biomass, leaf- and
   soil-respired CO2 as well as O-18 in leaf and xylem water. The C-13
   signal in phloem and respired CO2 in L.glaber in monoculture lagged
   behind those in species mixture, showing a slower transport of new
   photoassimilates to and through the phloem in monoculture. Furthermore,
   leaf-water O-18 enrichment above the xylem water in L.glaber increased
   after the rain in lower diversity plots suggesting a lower ability to
   compensate for increased transpiration. Lithocarpus glaber in
   monoculture showed higher C assimilation rate and water-use efficiency.
   However, these increased C resources did not translate in higher growth
   of L.glaber in monoculture suggesting the existence of larger
   nongrowth-related C sinks in monoculture. These ecophysiological
   responses of L.glaber, in agreement with current understanding of phloem
   transport are consistent with a stronger competition for water resources
   in monoculture than in species mixtures. Therefore, increasing species
   diversity in the close vicinity of the studied plants appears to
   alleviate physiological stress induced by water competition and to
   counterbalance the negative effects of interspecific competition on
   assimilation rates for L.glaber by allowing a higher fraction of the C
   assimilated to be allocated to growth in species mixture than in
   monoculture.}},

Abstract = {{hi the scope of pantropical studies aimed at understanding how the
   diversity of grammitid ferns (Polypodiaceae) has evolved and is
   maintained, we studied a diverse grammitid community in treeline elfin
   forests in eight study plots of 400 m(2) each at 3200 m on Cerro Toledo,
   Loja, southern Ecuador. We recorded a total of 7986 individuals of 16
   grammitid species. Ascogrammitis lehnertii is here described as a new
   species. We also recorded Mycopteris leucosticta, a species previously
   believed to be restricted to the Choco region of Ecuador. We found that
   the grammitid species were segregated by habitat into trunk-base and
   trunk specialists, which suggests that species coexistence in these
   diverse epiphytic communities is at least partly linked to habitat
   segregation. Ascogrammitis lehnertii and M. leucosticta were the second
   and third most abundant species, respectively, and both were mostly
   trunk-base species. The new species A. Mincrtii differs from its
   congeners by the combination of its relatively broad lamina, (2-)3-4 cm
   wide, fertile leaves bearing 2 nun long reddish setae in and near the
   sori, and by bearing proliferous roots from which new plants emerge.
   Phylogenetic analyses of atp beta, rbcL, rps4, trnG-trnR, and trnL-trnF
   DNA molecular sequences, using maximum likelihood, place A. lehnertii as
   sister to A. cuencana with strong support. Despite previous intensive
   collection efforts in Loja for the past 30 yr, all but one of the
   collections of this new species were made in the last three years. The
   discovery of A. lehnertii and the new record of M. leucosticta highlight
   the patchy distribution of some species in the Andes and the value of
   surveying habitats that potentially host unrecognized plant diversity.
   In order to facilitate further discovery, we provide a key to all
   species of Ascogrammitis.}},

Abstract = {{In numerous social species, males direct aggression towards female group
   members during intergroup fights, and this behaviour is commonly thought
   to function as mate guarding, even though males often target
   non-receptive females. In studying intergroup fights in a wild
   population of vervet monkeys, we found that male intragroup aggression
   was primarily directed towards individuals who had either just finished
   exhibiting, or were currently attempting to instigate intergroup
   aggression. Targeted females were less likely to instigate intergroup
   aggression in the future, indicating that male intragroup aggression
   functioned as coercion (when directed towards those who were currently
   trying to instigate a fight) and punishment (when directed towards those
   who had recently fought). These manipulative tactics effectively
   prevented intergroup encounters from escalating into fights and often
   de-escalated ongoing conflicts. Males who were likely sires were those
   most likely to use punishment/coercion, particularly when they were
   wounded, and, therefore, less able to protect vulnerable offspring
   should a risky intergroup fight erupt. This work, along with our
   previous finding that females use punishment and rewards to recruit
   males into participating in intergroup fights, highlights the inherent
   conflict of interest that exists between the sexes, as well as the role
   that social incentives can play in resolving this conflict. Furthermore,
   unlike other studies which have found punishment to be used
   asymmetrically between partners, these works represent a novel example
   of reciprocal punishment in a non-human animal.}},

Title = {{Multi-decadal mass balance series of three Kyrgyz glaciers inferred from

Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1899-1919}},

Abstract = {{Glacier surface mass balance observations in the Tien Shan and Pamir are
   relatively sparse and often discontinuous. Nevertheless, glaciers are
   one of the most important components of the high-mountain cryosphere in
   the region as they strongly influence water availability in the arid,
   continental and intensely populated downstream areas. This study
   provides reliable and continuous surface mass balance series for
   selected glaciers located in the Tien Shan and Pamir-Alay. By
   cross-validating the results of three independent methods, we
   reconstructed the mass balance of the three benchmark glaciers, Abramov,
   Golubin and Glacier no. 354 for the past 2 decades. By applying
   different approaches, it was possible to compensate for the limitations
   and shortcomings of each individual method. This study proposes the use
   of transient snow line observations throughout the melt season obtained
   from satellite optical imagery and terrestrial automatic cameras. By
   combining modelling with remotely acquired information on summer snow
   depletion, it was possible to infer glacier mass changes for unmeasured
   years. The model is initialized with daily temperature and precipitation
   data collected at automatic weather stations in the vicinity of the
   glacier or with adjusted data from climate reanalysis products.
   Multi-annual mass changes based on high-resolution digital elevation
   models and in situ glaciological surveys were used to validate the
   results for the investigated glaciers. Substantial surface mass loss was
   confirmed for the three studied glaciers by all three methods, ranging
   from 0.30 +/- 0.19 to 0.41 +/- 0.33m w.e. yr(-1) over the 2004-2016
   period. Our results indicate that integration of snow line observations
   into mass balance modelling significantly narrows the uncertainty ranges
   of the estimates. Hence, this highlights the potential of the
   methodology for application to unmonitored glaciers at larger scales for
   which no direct measurements are available.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in high-throughput technologies are bringing the study
   of empirical genotype-phenotype (GP) maps to the fore. Here, we use data
   from protein-binding microarrays to study an empirical GP map of
   transcription factor (TF) -binding preferences. In this map, each
   genotype is a DNA sequence. The phenotype of this DNA sequence is its
   ability to bind one or more TFs. We study this GP map using genotype
   networks, in which nodes represent genotypes with the same phenotype,
   and edges connect nodes if their genotypes differ by a single small
   mutation. We describe the structure and arrangement of genotype networks
   within the space of all possible binding sites for 525 TFs from three
   eukaryotic species encompassing three kingdoms of life (animal, plant,
   and fungi). We thus provide a high-resolution depiction of the
   architecture of an empirical GP map. Among a number of findings, we show
   that these genotype networks are small-world and assortative, and that
   they ubiquitously overlap and interface with one another. We also use
   polymorphism data from Arabidopsis thaliana to show how genotype network
   structure influences the evolution of TF-binding sites in vivo. We
   discuss our findings in the context of regulatory evolution.}},

Abstract = {{In the face of global biodiversity declines, predicting the fate of
   biological systems is a key goal in ecology. One popular approach is the
   search for early warning signals (EWSs) based on alternative stable
   states theory. In this review, we cover the theory behind nonlinearity
   in dynamic systems and techniques to detect the loss of resilience that
   can indicate state transitions. We describe the research done on generic
   abundance-based signals of instability that are derived from the
   phenomenon of critical slowing down, which represent the genesis of EWSs
   research. We highlight some of the issues facing the detection of such
   signals in biological systems - which are inherently complex and show
   low signal-to-noise ratios. We then document research on alternative
   signals of instability, including measuring shifts in spatial
   autocorrelation and trait dynamics, and discuss potential future
   directions for EWSs research based on detailed demographic and
   phenotypic data. We set EWSs research in the greater field of predictive
   ecology and weigh up the costs and benefits of simplicity vs. complexity
   in predictive models, and how the available data should steer the
   development of future methods. Finally, we identify some key unanswered
   questions that, if solved, could improve the applicability of these
   methods.}},

Title = {{`Genetic resources', an analysis of a multifaceted concept}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{222}},
Pages = {{86-94}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Genetic resources' is a key concept of the Convention on Biological
   Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol (NP). However, the term was
   coined to describe value in biodiversity and create an incentive for its
   protection and is thus of practical relevance for biological
   conservation beyond the legal context. The scope of this concept is also
   of interest to researchers, who may be unsure for which types of
   analysis they are legally and ethically expected to enter access and
   benefit sharing (ABS) negotiations. This article presents a biologically
   informed analysis, which leads to an understanding of `genetic
   resources' that considers various associations and implications of this
   notion, such as its relation to biodiversity and the role that
   intellectual property rights (IPR) play in the discourse. The aim is to
   provide a coherent, consistent and comprehensive understanding of the
   concept that can integrate and explain these aspects and consider both
   classical and novel ways of using genetic resources. Based on the
   biological function of genetic resources and an analysis of how they are
   currently used and valued, this article argues that genetic resources
   are a particular type of natural resource that is informational rather
   than tangible. This interpretation clearly identifies utilising digital
   genomic sequences as a form of using genetic resources. However, the
   article also discusses regulatory exceptions for certain utilisations of
   genetic resources and it mentions the possibility of treating digital
   sequences as such an exception.}},

   by image artifacts typically found in high-resolution SAR imagery and

   95\% of the detection rate offered by traditional schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Chloranthaceae were one of the first common lines during the early
   radiation of angiosperms, possibly reflecting adaptation to more open
   habitats. Phylogenetic analyses clarify the position of Cretaceous
   mesofossils in molecular trees of Recent taxa. Plants that produced

   in crown group Chloranthaceae with Hedyosmum; Canrightiopsis, with three
   stamens and no perianth, is sister to Sarcandra and Chloranthus; and
   Canrightia is a stem relative that illustrates a still bisexual stage in
   floral reduction. Plants that produced Pennipollis pollen are related to
   Chloranthaceae and/or Ceratophyllum rather than monocots. Appomattoxia,
   which produced Tucanopollis pollen, has equivocal affinities, but
   Pseudoasterophyllites, with similar pollen and stems with reduced
   leaves, may be a link between Chloranthaceae and Ceratophyllum. These
   results imply that flowers became unisexual before losing the perianth,

   secondarily derived from unisexual flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Stratified charcoalified fragments of thalloid organisms with tripartite
   tissue construction have been isolated from the basal member of the
   Upper Silurian (upper Ludlow) Downton Castle Sandstone Formation,
   exposed near Ludlow, Shropshire (England) and are considered to have had
   fungal affinity. They are divided into two major groups. The more novel
   of these is characterized by a superficial cortex separated from a basal
   layer of interweaving hyphae by an intermediate zone of compressed
   indeterminate tissue and members are placed in a new taxon,
   Tristratothallus ludfordensis. In the second, the intermediate zone
   comprises hyphae arranged at right angles to the cortex (termed
   palisade). Some members resemble the tissue construction of
   Nematothallus described from the Lower Devonian (Lochkovian) of the
   Welsh Borderland and considered to belong to fungi, some of which were
   lichenized. A further type, which shows remains of polysporic asci, is
   thought to represent a fragment of an apothecium (a disc-shaped ascoma
   of an ascomycete) of a pezizomycete and is the earliest such record. Yet
   others are characterized by a perforate cortex with occasional
   protruding hyphae, tissue construction of which was also recorded in the
   Lower Devonian of the Welsh Borderland and considered to display fungal
   characteristics. Coalified `black patches' are common on bedding
   surfaces throughout the latest Silurian and Early Devonian and
   frequently are associated with basal embryophytes and tracheophytes.
   Those reported here are the oldest known with three-dimensional
   organization, studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   attributed to fungi, and include some ascomycetes. Similar encrustations
   occur in even earlier rocks and may have been important constituents of
   the cryptogamic ground cover, which is postulated to have preceded
   higher plant life on land.}},

Title = {{In ovo yolk carotenoid and testosterone levels interactively influence
   female transfer of yolk antioxidants to her eggs}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Mothers can influence prenatal conditions by varying the amount of
   nutrients, hormones or antioxidants they provide to their developing
   young. Some of these substances even affect the transfer of these
   compounds in the next generation, but it is less clear how different
   maternally transmitted compounds interact with each other to shape
   reproductive resource allocation in their offspring. Here, we found that
   female Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) that were exposed to high
   carotenoid levels during embryonic development transferred lower
   concentrations of yolk antioxidants to their own eggs later in life.
   This effect disappeared when both testosterone and carotenoid
   concentrations were manipulated simultaneously, showing long-term and
   interactive effects of these maternally derived egg components on a
   female's own egg composition. Given that exposure to high levels of
   testosterone during embryo development stimulates the production of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairs antioxidant defenses, we
   propose that carotenoids act as in ovo antioxidants in an oxidatively
   stressful environment (i.e. when levels of testosterone are high) but
   might have prooxidant properties in an environment where they are not
   used to counteract an increased production of ROS. In line with this
   hypothesis, we previously showed that prenatal exposure to increased
   concentrations of yolk carotenoids leads to a rise of oxidative damage
   at adulthood, but only when yolk testosterone concentrations were not
   experimentally increased as well. As a consequence, antioxidants in the
   body may be used to limit oxidative damage in females exposed to high
   levels of carotenoids during development (but not in females exposed to
   increased levels of both carotenoids and testosterone), resulting in
   lower amounts of antioxidants being available for deposition into eggs.
   Since prenatal antioxidant exposure is known to influence
   fitness-related traits, the effect detected in this study might have
   transgenerational consequences.}},

Title = {{Nuclear genes, matK and the phylogeny of the Poales}},
Journal = {{TAXON}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{521-536}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Phylogenetic relationships within the monocot order Poales have been
   well studied, but several unrelated questions remain. These include the
   relationships among the basal families in the order, family
   delimitations within the restiid clade, and the search for nuclear
   single-copy gene loci to test the relationships based on chloroplast
   loci. To this end two nuclear loci (PhyB, Topo6) were explored both at
   the ordinal level, and within the Bromeliaceae and the restiid clade.
   First, a plastid reference tree was inferred based on matK, using 140
   taxa covering all APG IV families of Poales, and analyzed using
   parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The trees inferred
   from matK closely approach the published phylogeny based on
   whole-plastome sequencing. Of the two nuclear loci, Topo6 supported a
   congruent, but much less resolved phylogeny. By contrast, PhyB indicated
   different phylogenetic relationships, with, inter alia, Mayacaceae and
   Typhaceae sister to Poaceae, and Flagellariaceae in a basally branching
   position within the Poales. Within the restiid clade the differences
   between the three markers appear less serious. The Anarthria clade is
   first diverging in all analyses, followed by Restionoideae,
   Sporadanthoideae, Centrolepidoideae and Leptocarpoideae in the matK and
   Topo6 data, but in the PhyB data Centrolepidoideae diverges next,
   followed by a paraphyletic Restionoideae with a clade consisting of the
   monophyletic Sporadanthoideae and Leptocarpoideae nested within them.
   The Bromeliaceae phylogeny obtained from Topo6 is insufficiently sampled
   to make reliable statements, but indicates a good starting point for
   further investigations. We find that matK is remarkably good at
   retrieving the chloroplast phylogeny, that Topo6, despite low
   resolution, is suitable to test the generality of the plastid phylogeny
   as a taxic phylogeny, that PhyB might be too complex to be really useful
   at the level of families within an order, that the inclusion of the
   centrolepids in Restionaceae might be valid, but that there is no
   phylogenetic support for or against including the Anarthria clade in
   Restionaceae. The basal arrangement of families in the Poales
   (Bromeliaceae, Typhaceae, Rapateaceae) remains unresolved.}},

Title = {{Most finance to halt desertification also benefits multiple ecosystem
   services: A key to unlock investments in Land Degradation Neutrality?}},
Journal = {{ECOSYSTEM SERVICES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{B, SI}},
Pages = {{265-277}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying the demand for multiple ecosystem services is difficult
   because it is subjective and heterogeneous. Using land degradation as a
   case study, this paper explores land restoration finance as a proxy for
   global ecosystem service demand. Land degradation has been high on the
   UN agenda since the 1992 Rio Summit, together with climate change and
   biodiversity. The supply of many ecosystem services is declining due to
   land degradation and desertification, particularly in drylands. The
   inclusion of a Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) target in the United
   Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reaffirmed the
   commitment by the international community to tackle this global
   environmental challenge. If this vision adequately reflects society's
   values, as expressed through demand for ecosystem services, we should
   see land restoration finance targeting areas where potential ecosystem
   service supply could be enhanced the most. To test this hypothesis, we
   used spatial analysis of key ecosystem services, as well as comparative
   analysis of synergistic values and other indicators of financial
   resources committed between 2008 and 2013 to address land degradation.
   These activities can generate multiple benefits for many ecosystem
   functions and services. Official activity-level environmental ratings -
   called Rio Markers - were used to identify those activities that were
   intended to produce multiple ecosystem services benefits in terms of
   land restoration, biodiversity protection and climate change mitigation.
   Our analysis concludes that many land restoration activities are
   synergistic and reveals other important aspects: (i) developing
   countries report, on average, higher synergistic values than developed
   countries and development finance organizations; (ii) donor countries
   report more conservatively than recipient countries; (iii) multi-purpose
   synergistic projects attract more funders than single-purpose ones. In
   some cases countries with high ecosystem service supply receive higher
   investment, but this finding is not strong, indicating that investment
   could be more strategically targeted. These findings suggest, in
   particular, that the synergistic features of multi-purpose land
   restoration activities could be harnessed to enhance investment
   effectiveness and impact. This, in turn, would make LDN finance more
   prominent in development aid portfolios and in public/private
   sustainable investment strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Functional traits may help to explain the great variety of species
   performances in plant communities, but it is not clear whether the
   magnitude of trait values of a focal species or trait differences to
   co-occurring species are key for trait-based predictions. In addition,
   trait expression within species is often plastic, but this variation has
   been widely neglected in trait-based analyses. We studied functional
   traits and plant biomass of 59 species in 66 experimental grassland
   mixtures of varying species richness (Jena Experiment). We related mean
   species performances (species biomass and relative yield RY) and their
   plasticities along the diversity gradient to trait-based pedictors
   involving mean species traits (T-mean), trait plasticities along the
   diversity gradient (T-slope), extents of trait variation across
   communities (T-CV; coefficient of variation) and hierarchical
   differences (T-diff) and trait distances (absolute values of trait
   differences T-dist) between focal and co-occurring species. T-mean
   (30-55\%) and T-diff (30-33\%) explained most variation in mean species
   performances and their plasticities, but T-slope (20-25\%) was also
   important in explaining mean species performances. The mean species
   traits and the trait differences between focal species and neighbors
   with the greatest explanatory power were related to plant size and
   stature (shoot length, mass:height ratios) and leaf photosynthetic
   capacity (specific leaf area, stable carbon isotopes and leaf nitrogen
   concentration). The contribution of trait plasticities in explaining
   species performances varied in direction (positive or negative) and
   involved traits related to photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen acquisition
   (nitrogen concentrations and stable isotopes) as well as structural
   stability (shoot carbon concentrations). Our results suggest that
   incorporating plasticity in trait expression as well as trait
   differences to co-occurring species is critical for extending
   trait-based analyses to understand the assembly of plant communities and
   the contribution of individual species in structuring plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Soil sealing for urban and infrastructure development constitutes the
   most intense form of land degradation and affects all ecosystem
   services. Researchers and policy makers have become aware of this fact
   and call for limiting development and compensating for new soil sealing
   with unsealing measures. In a literature review, we found that the state
   of research about the impacts of soil sealing is far more advanced than
   about the potential and prerequisites of unsealing. In practice, soil
   restoration after mining and construction activities as well as
   redevelopment or renaturation of abandoned industrial sites are
   increasingly important issues, but systematic research on the success of
   soil unsealing and restoration is rare. In particular, the development
   of soils and vegetation after unsealing and restoration measures as well
   as their potential to provide ecosystem services need more detailed
   investigation.
   In 3 case studies, we demonstrate that replacing a sealed surface with
   soil to restore ecosystem services is always beneficial for humans and
   nature. An indicator-based mapping approach revealed the potential
   performance of different ecosystem services at former industrial sites
   in Switzerland. When unsealed sites are transformed to pioneer habitats,
   the intended vegetation may successfully be regained, but landscape
   connectivity is hardly enhanced due to increased overall landscape
   fragmentation. Our investigations show that with the techniques
   currently applied, the soil physical parameters in a restored
   agricultural soil developed favourably for crop growth within 15 years.
   However, unsealed soils are anthropogenic soils with reduced
   multifunctionality, and protecting natural soil against sealing is
   always the better option.}},

Abstract = {{Classification of remotely sensed images into land cover or land use is
   highly dependent on geographical information at least at two levels.
   First, land cover classes are observed in a spatially smooth domain
   separated by sharp region boundaries. Second, land classes and
   observation scale are also tightly intertwined: they tend to be
   consistent within areas of homogeneous appearance, or regions, in the
   sense that all pixels within a roof should be classified as roof,
   independently on the spatial support used for the classification. In
   this paper, we follow these two observations and encode them as priors
   in an energy minimization framework based on conditional random fields
   (CRFs), where classification results obtained at pixel and region levels
   are probabilistically fused. The aim is to enforce the final maps to be
   consistent not only in their own spatial supports (pixel and region) but
   also across supports, i.e., by getting the predictions on the pixel
   lattice and on the set of regions to agree. To this end, we define an
   energy function with three terms: 1) a data term for the individual
   elements in each support (support-specific nodes); 2) spatial
   regularization terms in a neighborhood for each of the supports
   (support-specific edges); and 3) a regularization term between
   individual pixels and the region containing each of them (intersupports
   edges). We utilize these priors in a unified energy minimization problem
   that can be optimized by standard solvers. The proposed 2L (sic) CRF
   model consists of a CRF defined over a bipartite graph, i.e., two
   interconnected layers within a single graph accounting for interlattice
   connections. 2L (sic) CRF is tested on two very high-resolution data
   sets involving submetric satellite and subdecimeter aerial data. In all
   cases, 2L (sic) CRF improves the result obtained by the independent base
   model (either random forests or convolutional neural networks) and by
   standard CRF models enforcing smoothness in the spatial domain.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution animal movement data are becoming increasingly
   available, yet having a multitude of empirical trajectories alone does
   not allow us to easily predict animal movement. To answer ecological and
   evolutionary questions at a population level, quantitative estimates of
   a species' potential to link patches or populations are of importance.
   We introduce an approach that combines movement-informed simulated
   trajectories with an environment-informed estimate of the trajectories'
   plausibility to derive connectivity. Using the example of bar-headed
   geese we estimated migratory connectivity at a landscape level
   throughout the annual cycle in their native range.
   We used tracking data of bar-headed geese to develop a multi-state
   movement model and to estimate temporally explicit habitat suitability
   within the species' range. We simulated migratory movements between
   range fragments, and calculated a measure we called route viability. The
   results are compared to expectations derived from published literature.
   Simulated migrations matched empirical trajectories in key
   characteristics such as stopover duration. The viability of the
   simulated trajectories was similar to that of the empirical
   trajectories. We found that, overall, the migratory connectivity was
   higher within the breeding than in wintering areas, corroborating
   previous findings for this species.
   We show how empirical tracking data and environmental information can be
   fused for meaningful predictions of animal movements throughout the year
   and even outside the spatial range of the available data. Beyond
   predicting migratory connectivity, our framework will prove useful for
   modelling ecological processes facilitated by animal movement, such as
   seed dispersal or disease ecology.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of culture for human social evolution hinges largely on
   the extent to which culture supports outcomes that would not otherwise
   occur. An especially controversial claim is that social learning leads
   groups to coalesce around group-typical behaviours and associated social
   norms that spill over to shape choices in asocial settings. To test
   this, we conducted an experiment with 878 groups of participants in 116
   communities in Sudan. Participants watched a short film and evaluated
   the appropriate way to behave in the situation dramatized in the film.
   Each session consisted of an asocial condition in which participants
   provided private evaluations and a social condition in which they
   provided public evaluations. Public evaluations allowed for social
   learning. Across sessions, we randomized the order of the two
   conditions. Public choices dramatically increased the homogeneity of
   normative evaluations. When the social condition was first, this
   homogenizing effect spilled over to subsequent asocial conditions. The
   asocial condition when first was thus alone in producing distinctly
   heterogeneous groups. Altogether, information about the choices of
   others led participants to converge rapidly on similar normative
   evaluations that continued to hold sway in subsequent asocial settings.
   These spillovers were at least partly owing to the combined effects of
   conformity and self-consistency. Conformity dominated self-consistency
   when the two mechanisms were in conflict, but self-consistency otherwise
   produced choices that persisted through time. Additionally, the tendency
   to conform was heterogeneous. Females conformed more than males, and
   conformity increased with the number of other people a decision-maker
   observed before making her own choice.}},

Abstract = {{Alpine ecosystems are vulnerable to ever-changing environmental
   conditions, leading to shifts in vegetation distribution and composition
   with implications on soil functionality and carbon (C) turnover.
   Although deadwood represents an important global C stock, scarce
   information is available on how slope exposure influences the
   wood-inhabiting microbiota throughout the decomposition process in an
   Alpine setting. We therefore evaluated the impact of slope exposure
   (north- vs. south-facing sites) on physicochemical and microbiological
   properties (microbial abundance based on real-time PCR: fungal 18S rRNA,
   dinitrogen reductase {[}nifH]; microbial biomass: double strand DNA; and
   microbial activity: hydrolytic enzyme activities of the main nutrient
   cycles) of Picea abies wood blocks and the underlying soil in a field
   experiment in the Italian Alps during a three-year period. Overall, a
   higher abundance of fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria was recorded in
   the soil at the north-facing site where cooler and moister conditions
   were observed. In contrast, no exposure effects were found for these two
   microbial groups in the wood blocks, while their abundance increased
   over time, accompanied by more acidic conditions with progressing decay.
   The impact of exposure was also enzyme specific and time dependent for
   both the P. abies wood blocks and the underlying soil.}},

Abstract = {{We present here a new eco-efficiency process-improvement method to
   highlight combined environmental and costs hotspots of the production
   process of new material at a very early development stage.
   Production-specific and scaled-up results for life cycle assessment
   (LCA) and production costs are combined in a new analysis to identify
   synergetic improvement potentials and trade-offs, setting goals for the
   eco-design of new processes. The identified hotspots and bottlenecks
   will help users to focus on the relevant steps for improvements from an
   eco-efficiency perspective and potentially reduce their associated
   environmental impacts and production costs. Our method is illustrated
   with a case study of nanocellulose. The results indicate that the
   production route should start with carrot pomace, use heat and solvent
   recovery, and deactivate the enzymes with bleach instead of heat. To
   further improve the process, the results show that focus should be laid
   on the carrier polymer, sodium alginate, and the production of the GripX
   coating. Overall, the method shows that the underlying LCA scale-up
   framework is valuable for purposes beyond conventional LCA studies and
   is applicable at a very early stage to provide researchers with a better
   understanding of their production process.}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Key population processes are sometimes driven by male dynamics, but
   these drivers are often overlooked because of the scale over which they
   operate. Lions (Panthera leo) provide an ideal case study for
   investigating factors governing male dynamics and their influence on
   population sustainability. Lions display sexually selected infanticide,
   and resident males must defend their offspring from nomads that may have
   dispersed over long distances; factors affecting male-male competition
   over large spatial scales can have population wide consequences. We
   report here on the first systematic analysis of long-term
   individual-based data of male lions in the Serengeti National Park,
   Tanzania. From 1974 to 2012, we observed 471 coalitions (796 males) in
   our study area. We investigate factors affecting male immigration and
   the impacts on the resident population. The yearly number of nomadic
   males entering the study population affected cub survival and mating
   access. Success rates of nomadic males gaining tenure with a pride
   increased with age and coalition size. We observed a significant decline
   in male immigration, which resulted in lowered levels of male
   replacement in the study population, reduced infanticide, and greater
   cub survival. The decline in incoming males likely resulted from
   increased anthropogenic pressures in surrounding areas. Conversely, the
   core study population was largely buffered from anthropogenic threats
   and likely served as a source to neighboring sinks. Reduced infanticide
   in the core population might have compensated for rising lion
   mortalities in surrounding areas, but as human-wildlife conflicts
   intensify with the rapidly growing human population, compensatory
   mechanisms may become overwhelmed.}},

Abstract = {{The Late Devonian was a time of dramatic environmental perturbations
   affecting marine ecosystems. Both the Kellwasser (latest Frasnian) and
   the Hangenberg crises (latest Famennian) are primarily reported as
   phases of drastic decreases in marine diversity while the Hangenberg
   Crisis is also described as a bottleneck in vertebrate evolution.
   Fossil-bearing localities with Upper Devonian strata are of great
   interest to assess variations in the effects of environmental
   perturbations on biodiversity. For this purpose, we examined changes in
   alpha diversity and ecospace utilization of 21 Famennian (Late Devonian)
   and early Tournaisian (Early Carboniferous) invertebrate associations
   containing 9828 specimens from Madene el Mrakib and Aguelmous (southern
   Maider Basin, northeastern Anti-Atlas, Morocco), where some layers yield
   exceptionally preserved gnathostome remains. Both the invertebrate and
   vertebrate associations contain predominantly opportunistic and pelagic
   taxa indicating oxygen depletion near the seafloor in this region.
   Nevertheless, the ecospace extension was fluctuating and correlated with
   regional and/or global sea-level changes and oxygenation of bottom
   waters. In the Wider Basin, the ecospace was depleted after and during
   several bio-events such as the Kellwasser and Hangenberg crises, the
   Annulata event (middle Famennian) as well as during the early
   Tournaisian. Abiotic as well as biotic changes (instability of the
   invertebrate ecosystem) are considered to have influenced Famennian
   vertebrate diversity because they were more or less directly dependent
   on invertebrates as a food source.}},

Title = {{Spatial structure of foraging meerkat groups is affected by both social

Abstract = {{Group-living animals need to trade off the benefits and the costs of
   close proximity to conspecifics. Benefits can be increased, and costs
   reduced by preferentially choosing specific locations within a group
   best adjusted to an individual's needs or by associating with specific
   group members and/or avoiding others. We investigated the spatial
   structure of meerkat (Suricata suricatta) groups and whether it was
   shaped by social factors such as affiliation or aggression among group
   members, predation risk, foraging success, or a mix of these different
   factors. Using social network analyses, based on spatial networks, we
   found associations between the dominant pair, among males and among same
   aged individuals, and dis-assortment by sex only in one to two of the
   six groups. In addition, the structure of meerkat groups was highly
   variable, as individual strength within the calculated networks was not
   repeatable over time. Meerkats seemed to adjust their location to their
   physical environment, as dominant individuals were located further
   toward the front of the group, where foraging success is likely higher
   and young individuals located further toward the back of the group,
   where they can benefit most from the vigilance effort of their
   conspecifics. We conclude that meerkat groups display a dynamic spatial
   structure depending on both the current social and physical
   environmental.
   Significance
   Group-living animals can achieve greater benefits from close association
   with conspecifics by choosing specific locations within a group or
   associating with specific group members and/or avoiding others. A
   considerable body of work has examined how differences in predation risk
   or foraging success affect the relative location of individuals within a
   group. Several studies investigated the association between individuals,
   in order to draw conclusions on the social structure. However, it is
   important to disentangle the impact of all of these different aspects on
   the spatial structure of a group. Here, we provide evidence that both
   the social and physical environment is important for the spatial
   assortment of meerkats, a social mongoose foraging in cohesive groups.}},

Abstract = {{Predators can indirectly affect prey survival and reproduction by
   evoking costly antipredator responses. Such nonconsumptive effects may
   be as strong or stronger than consumptive predator effects. However,
   evidence for this in large terrestrial vertebrate systems is equivocal
   and few studies quantify the actual fitness costs of nonconsumptive
   effects. Here, we investigated whether nonconsumptive effects elicited
   by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), a large terrestrial predator, reduced
   survival in an ungulate prey, the European roe deer (Capreolus
   capreolus). To reveal the behavioral processes underlying nonconsumptive
   effects, we distinguished between proactive risk avoidance of areas with
   high lynx encounter probability, and reactive risk avoidance in response
   to actual lynx encounters and analyzed these responses using step
   selection functions. We also quantified the consequences of these
   behaviors for deer survival. Deer reacted differently at day and at
   night, but avoided high-risk areas proactively during the day and at
   night in the summer. During a predator encounter, deer increased
   avoidance of high-risk areas at night but not during the day. Thus, roe
   deer exhibited a behavioral response race that involved temporally and
   spatially varying tradeoffs with environmental constraints. We found
   evidence that nonconsumptive effects of lynx predation risk reduced deer
   survival and that survival was more sensitive to variation in
   nonconsumptive effects of lynx than to variation in human proximity. Our
   findings highlight that nonconsumptive effects may depend on the
   spatiotemporal distribution of risks and the environmental context, and
   we discuss how human factors contribute to predator-prey dynamics in
   human dominated landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{While glacier mass changes in the Himalaya since the year 2000 are
   relatively well investigated, there is still a lack of knowledge about
   the long-term changes and their climatic drivers. We use historical and
   recent remote sensing data to study glacier changes of the Lahaul-Spiti
   region in western Himalaya, India, over the last four decades
   (1971-2013). The glaciers were losing mass moderately between 1971 and
   1999 (-0.07 +/- 0.1 m w.e. year(-1)) while the losses have increased
   significantly after 2000 (-0.30 +/- 0.1 m w.e. year(-1)). During both
   periods, the debris-covered glaciers and glaciers having pro-glacial
   lakes lost more mass than glaciers with little debris cover. Mass
   changes of Chhota Shigri, a benchmark glacier, closely matched the
   average of the overall study area. Analysis of gridded climate data
   covering the period 1948-2015 shows that the mean annual air temperature
   increased, especially since 1995. One dataset shows a significant
   increase in summer temperature after 2000 while others do not show any
   trend. The mean annual precipitation started decreasing around 1995 and
   reached a minimum around 2000, after which it increased again. One
   dataset shows a significant decrease in winter precipitation after 2000
   while the others show no trend. The climate data indicate that the
   increase in mean annual temperature from 1995, combined with no
   significant trend/significant decrease of winter precipitation in the
   period after 2000, has probably resulted in accelerated mass loss of the
   glaciers.}},

Volume = {{106}},

Abstract = {{Competition can be fully hierarchical or intransitive, and this degree
   of hierarchy is driven by multiple factors, including environmental
   conditions, the functional traits of the species involved or the
   topology of competition networks. Studies simultaneously analysing these
   drivers of competition hierarchy are rare. Additionally, organisms
   compete either directly or via interference competition for resources or
   space, within a local neighbourhood or across the habitat. Therefore,
   the drivers of competition could change accordingly and depend on the
   taxa studied. We performed the first multi-taxon study on pairwise
   competition across major taxonomic groups, including experiments with
   vascular plants, mosses, saprobic fungi, aquatic protists and soil
   bacteria. We evaluated how general is competition intransitivity from
   the pairwise competition matrix including all species and also for each
   possible three-species combination (triplets). We then examined which
   species were likely to engage in competitive loops and the effects of
   environmental conditions, competitive rank and functional traits on
   intransitive competition. We found some degree of competition
   intransitivity in all taxa studied, with 38\% to 5\% of triplets being
   intransitive. Variance in competitive rank between species and more
   fertile conditions strongly reduced intransitivity, with triplets
   composed of species differing widely in their competitive ranks much
   less likely to be intransitive. Including functional traits of the
   species involved more than doubled the variation explained compared to
   models including competitive rank only. Both trait means and variance
   within triplets affected the odds of them being intransitive. However,
   the traits responsible and the direction of trait effects varied widely
   between taxa, suggesting that traits can have a wide variety of effects
   on competition.Synthesis. We evaluated the drivers of competition across
   multiple taxa and showed that productivity and competitive rank are
   fundamental drivers of intransitivity. We also showed that not only the
   functional traits of each species, but also those of the accompanying
   species, determine competition intransitivity. Intransitive competition
   is common across multiple taxa but can dampen under fertile conditions
   or for those species with large variance in their competitive abilities.
   This provides a first step towards predicting the prevalence of
   intransitive competition in natural communities.}},

   Prediction using Different Machine Learning Approaches}},
Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{For next place prediction, machine learning methods which incorporate
   contextual data are frequently used. However, previous studies often do
   not allow deriving generalizable methodological recommendations, since
   they use different datasets, methods for discretizing space, scales of
   prediction, prediction algorithms, and context data, and therefore lack
   comparability. Additionally, the cold start problem for new users is an
   issue. In this study, we predict next places based on one trajectory
   dataset but with systematically varying prediction algorithms, methods
   for space discretization, scales of prediction (based on a novel
   hierarchical approach), and incorporated context data. This allows to
   evaluate the relative influence of these factors on the overall
   prediction accuracy. Moreover, in order to tackle the cold start problem
   prevalent in recommender and prediction systems, we test the effect of
   training the predictor on all users instead of each individual one. We
   find that the prediction accuracy shows a varying dependency on the
   method of space discretization and the incorporated contextual factors
   at different spatial scales. Moreover, our user-independent approach
   reaches a prediction accuracy of around 75\%, and is therefore an
   alternative to existing user-specific models. This research provides
   valuable insights into the individual and combinatory effects of model
   parameters and algorithms on the next place prediction accuracy. The
   results presented in this paper can be used to determine the influence
   of various contextual factors and to help researchers building more
   accurate prediction models. It is also a starting point for future work
   creating a comprehensive framework to guide the building of prediction
   models.}},

Abstract = {{1. It is becoming well-established that plant diversity is instrumental
   in stabilizing the temporal functioning of ecosystems through population
   dynamics and the so-called insurance or portfolio effect. However, it
   remains unclear whether diversity-stability relationships and the role
   of population dynamics in soil microbial communities parallel those in
   plant communities.
   2. Our study took place in a long-term land management experiment with
   and without perturbation to the soil ecosystem by tilling. We assessed
   the impacts of the soil perturbation on the diversity, synchrony and
   stability relationships in soil fungal and bacterial communities.
   3. We found that the perturbation to the soil ecosystem not only reduced
   the abundance and richness of the fungal community, but it also reduced
   the temporal stability in both bacterial and fungal abundance. The
   fungal community abundance was destabilized by soil tilling due to
   reduced richness and increased temporal variation in individual taxa. In
   contrast, soil tilling destabilized the bacterial community abundance by
   reducing the temporal variation in individual taxa. Both bacterial and
   fungal community abundances were more temporally variable when taxa
   fluctuated more synchronously through time.
   4. Our results show that land management practices, such as tilling, can
   destabilize soil microbial abundance by reducing the richness and
   disrupting the temporal dynamics below-ground. However, the differences
   in the mechanisms that underlie the temporal variations in fungal and
   bacterial net abundances suggest that the mechanisms that drive the
   stability can differ among guilds of organisms within the same system.
   The different temporal responses between the fungal and bacterial
   communities are likely linked to changes in edaphic properties resulting
   from the physical alteration of the soil structure.}},

Abstract = {{Soils in mountainous areas are often polygenetic, developed in slope
   covers that relate to glacial and periglacial activities of the
   Pleistocene and Holocene and reflect climatic variations. Landscape
   development during the Holocene may have been influenced by
   erosion/solifluction that often started after the Holocene climatic
   optimum. To trace back soil evolution and its timing, we applied a
   multi-methodological approach. This approach helped us to outline
   scenario of soil transformation. According to our results, some aeolian
   input must have occurred in the late Pleistocene. During that time and
   the early Holocene, the soils most likely had features of Cryosols or
   Leptosols. Physico-chemical and mineralogical analyses have indicated
   that the material was denudated (between late Boreal to the Atlantic)
   from the ridge and upper-slope positions forming a colluvium at
   mid-slope positions. Later, during the Sub-Boreal, mass wasting of the
   remains of silt material deposited at the end of the Pleistocene age on
   the ridge top seems to have occurred. In addition, the cool and moist
   conditions caused the deposition of a colluvium at the lower-slope
   positions. The next phase was characterized by the transformation of
   Leptosols/Cambisols into Podzols at upper-slope or shoulder positions
   and to Albic Cambisols at mid-slope positions. During the Sub-Boreal
   period, Stagnosols started to form at the lower part of the slope
   catena. Overall, the highest erosion rates were calculated at the
   upper-slope position and the lowest rates at mid-slope sites.
   Berylium-10 (Be-10) data showed that the Bs, BC/C were covered during
   the Holocene by a colluvium with a different geological composition
   which complicated the calculation of erosion or accumulation rates. The
   interpretation of erosion and accumulation rates in such multi-layered
   materials may, therefore, be hampered. However, the multi-methodological
   reconstruction we applied shed light on the soil and landscape evolution
   of the eastern Karkonosze Mountains. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{1. In nature, grasses simultaneously establish multiple symbiotic
   associations with endophytic fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF). The effect of these multiple interactions on competitive
   interactions between plants remains poorly understood.
   2. In this study, we tested whether endophytes and AMF (Glomus mosseae
   or Glomus etunicatum) alter plant competition between a subordinate
   plant species that associates with both symbionts (Achnatherum
   sibiricum) and a dominant plant species, Stipa grandis, that only
   associates with one symbiont (AMF). And we hypothesized that endophytes
   can facilitate the coexistence of the subordinate plant species (A.
   sibiricum) and the dominant plant species (S. grandis).
   3. The results demonstrated that endophyte infection significantly
   enhanced the competitive ability of the subordinate plant species
   compared to the dominant plant species. The effects of AMF on plant
   competition were variable and depended on the identity of the AMF
   species. Glomus etunicatum gave A. sibiricum plants a higher competitive
   ability, while G. mosseae gave S. grandis a higher competitive ability.
   Simultaneous infections of both endophytes and AMF in A. sibiricum also
   altered the competitive relationships with S. grandis.
   4. In conclusion, these results suggest that endophytic fungi can
   facilitate the coexistence of a subordinate plant species with a
   dominant plant species. Moreover, endophytes could not only affect the
   competitive ability of the host plant directly but also indirectly by
   interacting with different AMF to change the growth of competing plant
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Laud use change strongly affects soil organic carbon (SOC), which is a
   critical driving force for soil quality and soil services. However, the
   influence of detailed land use dynamics on SOC remains an active
   research field. We investigated the impact of long-term grass-/cropland
   conversion dynamics on SOC for the Swiss agroecosystem (8500 km(2)). In
   Switzerland multi-temporal SOC observations are sparse, while the
   spatio-temporal resolution of available land use data is inadequate to
   capture small structured and dynamic land use. Thus, we stratified
   one-time SOC observations of two periods (n(1995-1999) = 1096;
   n(2011-2015) = 502) into typical land use classes of grass-/cropland
   conversion regimes to analyze states and trends of SOC. First, based on
   spectral imagery and auxiliary variables, we established a Random Forest
   classifier to detect annual grass-/cropland distributions in a spatial
   resolution of 30 x 30 m for 2000-2015. Second, we used the annual land
   use maps to derive classes of typical land use dynamics based on a
   pattern description of conversion regimes. Third, we comparatively
   assessed the SOC covariate importance (IMP) and SOC sample
   representation of land use dynamics using terrain and climate
   covariates. Subsequently, we statistically analyzed SOC across land use
   dynamics and two periods. The land use classifier shows an Overall
   Accuracy of 86\%, while the annual land use maps deviate by 6\%-11\%
   from census data. 46\% of the farmland underlies frequent
   grass-/cropland conversions. The SOC covariate importance of land use
   dynamics is increased by at least 2.4 times compared to the SOC
   covariates. The SOC observations consistently represent land use
   dynamics across SOC covariates. In both periods, SOC increased as the
   grassland share within the land use regimes increased. The mean SOC for
   permanent grasslands is 35 g kg(-1) and 17 g kg(-1) for permanent
   croplands. Areas of land use conversions where grassland is dominant
   show increased SOC (29-30 g kg(-1)) compared to areas where cropland was
   dominant (23-25 g kg(-1)). The mean differences of SOC between the
   periods and classes are statistically not significant except for
   permanent cropland, for which the SOC is decreased by 5.2 g kg(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Why tropical forests harbour an exceptional number of species with
   striking differences in abundances remains an open question. We propose
   a theoretical framework to address this question in which rare species
   may have different extirpation risks depending on species ranks in tree
   growth and sensitivities to neighbourhood interactions. To evaluate the
   framework, we studied tree growth and its responses to neighbourhood
   dissimilarity (ND) in traits and phylogeny for 146 species in a
   neotropical forest. We found that tree growth was positively related to
   ND, and common species were more strongly affected by ND than rare
   species, which may help delay dominance of common species. Rare species
   grew more slowly at the community-wide average ND than common species.
   But rare species grew faster when common species tended to dominate
   locally, which may help reduce extirpation risk of rare species. Our
   study highlights that tree growth rank among species depends on their
   responses to neighbourhood interactions, which can be important in
   fostering diversity maintenance in tropical forests.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual reproduction is inherently interactive, especially in animal
   species such as humans that exhibit extended pair bonding. Yet we have
   little knowledge of the role of male characteristics and their
   evolutionary impact on reproductive behavioural phenotypes, to the
   extent that biologists typically consider component traits (e.g.
   reproductive timing) as female-specific. Based on extensive genealogical
   data detailing the life histories of 6435 human mothers born across four
   centuries of modern history, we use an animal modelling approach to
   estimate the indirect genetic effect of men on the reproductive
   phenotype of their partners. These analyses show that a woman's
   reproductive timing (age at first birth) is influenced by her partner's
   genotype. This indirect genetic effect is positively correlated with the
   direct genetic effect expressed in women, such that total heritable
   variance in this trait is doubled when heritable partner effects are
   considered. Our study thus suggests that much of the heritable variation
   in women's reproductive timing is mediated via partner effects, and that
   the evolutionary potential of this trait is far greater than previously
   appreciated.}},

   unbiased empirical estimates of variation in selection are scarce, and
   the question of how much of the variation in selection translates into
   variation in genetic change has largely been ignored. Using long-term
   individual-based data for a wild rodent population, we quantify the
   magnitude of fluctuating selection on body size. Subsequently, we
   estimate the evolutionary dynamics of size and test for a link between
   fluctuating selection and evolution. We show that, over the past
   11years, phenotypic selection on body size has fluctuated significantly.
   However, the strength and direction of genetic change have remained
   largely constant over the study period; that is, the rate of genetic
   change was similar in years where selection favoured heavier vs. lighter
   individuals. This result suggests that over shorter timescales,
   fluctuating selection does not necessarily translate into fluctuating
   evolution. Importantly however, individual-based simulations show that
   the correlation between fluctuating selection and fluctuating evolution
   can be obscured by the effect of drift, and that substantially more data
   are required for a precise and accurate estimate of this correlation. We
   identify new challenges in measuring the coupling between selection and
   evolution, and provide methods and guidelines to overcome them.}},

Abstract = {{Stable carbon isotope analyses of vertebrate hard tissues such as bones,
   teeth, and tusks provide information about animal diets in ecological,
   archeological, and paleontological contexts. There is debate about how
   carbon isotope compositions of collagen and apatite carbonate differ in
   terms of their relationship to diet, and to each other. We evaluated
   relationships between C-13(collagen) and C-13(carbonate) among
   free-ranging southern African mammals to test predictions about the
   influences of dietary and physiological differences between species.
   Whereas the slopes of C-13(collagen)-C-13(carbonate) relationships among
   carnivores are 1, herbivore C-13(collagen) increases with increasing
   dietary C-13 at a slower rate than does C-13(carbonate), resulting in
   regression slopes >1. This outcome is consistent with predictions that
   herbivore C-13(collagen) is biased against low protein diet components
   (C-13-enriched C-4 grasses in these environments), and C-13(carbonate)
   is C-13-enriched due to release of C-13-depleted methane as a by-product
   of microbial fermentation in the digestive tract. As methane emission is
   constrained by plant secondary metabolites in browse, the latter effect
   becomes more pronounced with higher levels of C-4 grass in the diet.
   Increases in C-13(carbonate) are also larger in ruminants than
   nonruminants. Accordingly, we show that C-13(collagen)-(carbonate)
   spacing is not constant within herbivores, but increases by up to 5
   parts per thousand across species with different diets and physiologies.
   Such large variation, often assumed to be negligible within trophic
   levels, clearly cannot be ignored in carbon isotope-based diet
   reconstructions.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic degradation of natural habitats is a global driver of
   wildlife population declines. Local population responses to such
   environmental perturbations are generally well understood, but in
   socially structured populations, interactions between environmental and
   social factors may influence population responses. Thus, understanding
   how habitat degradation affects the dynamics of these populations
   requires simultaneous consideration of social and environmental
   mechanisms underlying demographic responses. Here we investigated the
   effect of habitat degradation through commercial forestry on
   spatiotemporal dynamics of a group-living bird, the Siberian jay,
   Perisoreus infaustus, in boreal forests of northern Sweden. We assessed
   the interacting effects of forestry, climate and population density on
   stage-specific, seasonal life-history rates and population dynamics,
   using long-term, individual-based demographic data from 70 territories
   in natural and managed forests. Stage-specific survival and reproductive
   rates, and consequently population growth, were lower in managed forests
   than in natural forests. Population growth was most sensitive to breeder
   survival and was more sensitive to early dispersing juveniles than those
   delaying dispersal. Forestry decreased population growth in managed
   forests by reducing reproductive success and breeder survival. Increased
   snow depth improved winter survival, and warmer spring temperatures
   enhanced reproductive success, particularly in natural forests.
   Population growth was stable in natural forests but it was declining in
   managed forests, and this difference accelerated under forecasted
   climate scenarios. Thus, climatic change could exacerbate the rate of
   forestry-induced population decline through reduced snow cover in our
   study species, and in other species with similar life-history
   characteristics and habitat requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of the AVRPM3(A2/F2) avirulence protein from powdery mildew
   by the wheat PM3A/F immune receptor induces a hypersensitive response
   after co-expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The molecular determinants
   of this interaction and how they shape natural AvrPm3(a2/f2) allelic
   diversity are unknown. We sequenced the AvrPm3(a2/f2) gene in a
   worldwide collection of 272 mildew isolates. Using the natural
   polymorphisms of AvrPm3(a2/f2) as well as sequence information from
   related gene family members, we tested 85 single-residue-altered
   AVRPM3(A2/F2) variants with PM3A, PM3F and PM3F(L456P/Y458H) (modified
   for improved signaling) in Nicotiana benthamiana for effects on
   recognition. An intact AvrPm3(a2/f2) gene was found in all analyzed
   isolates and the protein variant recognized by PM3A/F occurred globally
   at high frequencies. Single-residue alterations in AVRPM3(A2/F2) mostly
   disrupted, but occasionally enhanced, the recognition response by PM3A,
   PM3F and PM3F(L456P/Y458H). Residues enhancing hypersensitive responses
   constituted a protein domain separate from both naturally occurring
   polymorphisms and positively selected residues of the gene family. These
   results demonstrate the utility of using gene family sequence diversity
   to screen residues for their role in recognition. This approach
   identified a putative interaction surface in AVRPM3(A2/F2) not
   polymorphic in natural alleles. We conclude that molecular mechanisms
   besides recognition drive AvrPm3(a2/f2) diversification.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of tick-borne diseases caused by Borrelia burgdorferi
   sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp. has been
   rising in Europe in recent decades. Early pre-assessment of acarological
   hazard still represents a complex challenge. The aim of this study was
   to model Ixodes ricinus questing nymph density and its infection rate
   with B. burgdorferi s.l., A. phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp. in five
   European countries (Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary)
   in various land cover types differing in use and anthropisation
   (agricultural, urban and natural) with climatic and environmental
   factors (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized
   Difference Water Index (NDWI), Land Surface Temperature (LST) and
   precipitation). We show that the relative abundance of questing nymphs
   was significantly associated with climatic conditions, such as higher
   values of NDVI recorded in the sampling period, while no differences
   were observed among land use categories. However, the density of
   infected nymphs (DIN) also depended on the pathogen considered and land
   use. These results contribute to a better understanding of the variation
   in acarological hazard for Ixodes ricinus transmitted pathogens in
   Central Europe and provide the basis for more focused ecological studies
   aimed at assessing the effect of land use in different sites on tick
   host pathogens interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Protected areas provide some of the last refuges for Asian elephants in
   the wild. Managing these areas for elephants will be critical for
   elephant conservation. Scientists know little about elephant habitat use
   in Asia and how invasive species or livestock grazing influence habitat
   use. We studied these issues in two protected areas in Sri Lanka,
   Udawalawe National Park and Hurulu Eco-Park. These areas contain some of
   Sri Lanka's largest remaining grasslands. These grasslands are
   threatened by the invasive and toxic shrub, Lantana camara, and are used
   for illegal livestock grazing. To measure habitat use by elephants and
   livestock, we conducted dung surveys along over 50 km of transects
   stratified across grassland, scrub, and forest. We surveyed 159
   vegetation plots along these transects to assess plant composition, and
   mapped habitat types based on satellite images. We used mixed-effect
   models to determine the relative importance of habitats, livestock
   presence, and plant associations for elephant use. Elephant presence was
   greatest in scrub and grassland habitats, positively associated with
   both livestock presence and short graminoids, and unaffected by L.
   camara, which was widespread but at low densities. Given the importance
   of these areas to elephants, we recommend a precautionary management
   approach that focuses on curbing both illegal grazing and the spread of
   L. camara.}},

Title = {{Ecological opportunity and predator-prey interactions: linking
   eco-evolutionary processes and diversification in adaptive radiations}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{285}},
Number = {{1874}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Much of life's diversity has arisen through ecological opportunity and
   adaptive radiations, but the mechanistic underpinning of such
   diversification is not fully understood. Competition and predation can
   affect adaptive radiations, but contrasting theoretical and empirical
   results show that they can both promote and interrupt diversification. A
   mechanistic understanding of the link between microevolutionary
   processes and macroevolutionary patterns is thus needed, especially in
   trophic communities. Here, we use a trait-based eco-evolutionary model
   to investigate the mechanisms linking competition, predation and
   adaptive radiations. By combining available micro-evolutionary theory
   and simulations of adaptive radiations we show that intraspecific
   competition is crucial for diversification as it induces disruptive
   selection, in particular in early phases of radiation. The
   diversification rate is however decreased in later phases owing to
   interspecific competition as niche availability, and population sizes
   are decreased. We provide new insight into how predation tends to have a
   negative effect on prey diversification through decreased population
   sizes, decreased disruptive selection and through the exclusion of prey
   from parts of niche space. The seemingly disparate effects of
   competition and predation on adaptive radiations, listed in the
   literature, may thus be acting and interacting in the same adaptive
   radiation at different relative strength as the radiation progresses.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cooperatively breeding common marmosets show substantial variation in
   the amount of help they provide. Pay-to-stay and social prestige models
   of helping attribute this variation to audience effects, i.e. that
   individuals help more if group members can witness their interactions
   with immatures, whereas models of kin selection, group augmentation or
   those stressing the need to gain parenting experience do not predict any
   audience effects. We quantified the readiness of adult marmosets to
   share food in the presence or absence of other group members. Contrary
   to both predictions, we found a reverse audience effect on food-sharing
   behaviour: marmosets would systematically share more food with immatures
   when no audience was present. Thus, helping in common marmosets, at
   least in related family groups, does not support the pay-to-stay or the
   social prestige model, and helpers do not take advantage of the
   opportunity to engage in reputation management. Rather, the results
   appear to reflect a genuine concern for the immatures' well-being, which
   seems particularly strong when solely responsible for the immatures.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty Assessment of Synthetic Design Hydrographs for Gauged and

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Design hydrographs described by peak discharge, hydrograph volume, and
   hydrograph shape are essential for engineering tasks involving storage.
   Such design hydrographs are inherently uncertain as are classical flood
   estimates focusing on peak discharge only. Various sources of
   uncertainty contribute to the total uncertainty of synthetic design
   hydrographs for gauged and ungauged catchments. These comprise model
   uncertainties, sampling uncertainty, and uncertainty due to the choice
   of a regionalization method. A quantification of the uncertainties
   associated with flood estimates is essential for reliable decision
   making and allows for the identification of important uncertainty
   sources. We therefore propose an uncertainty assessment framework for
   the quantification of the uncertainty associated with synthetic design
   hydrographs. The framework is based on bootstrap simulations and
   consists of three levels of complexity. On the first level, we assess
   the uncertainty due to individual uncertainty sources. On the second
   level, we quantify the total uncertainty of design hydrographs for
   gauged catchments and the total uncertainty of regionalizing them to
   ungauged catchments but independently from the construction uncertainty.
   On the third level, we assess the coupled uncertainty of synthetic
   design hydrographs in ungauged catchments, jointly considering
   construction and regionalization uncertainty. We find that the most
   important sources of uncertainty in design hydrograph construction are
   the record length and the choice of the flood sampling strategy. The
   total uncertainty of design hydrographs in ungauged catchments depends
   on the catchment properties and is not negligible in our case.}},

Abstract = {{Flood hydrograph shapes contain valuable information on the
   flood-generation mechanisms of a catchment. To make good use of this
   information, we express flood hydrograph shapes as continuous functions
   using a functional data approach. We propose a clustering approach based
   on functional data for flood hydrograph shapes to identify a set of
   representative hydrograph shapes on a catchment scale and use these
   catchment-specific sets of representative hydrographs to establish
   regions of catchments with similar flood reactivity on a regional scale.
   We applied this approach to flood samples of 163 medium-size Swiss
   catchments. The results indicate that three representative hydrograph
   shapes sufficiently describe the hydrograph shape variability within a
   catchment and therefore can be used as a proxy for the flood behavior of
   a catchment. These catchment-specific sets of three hydrographs were
   used to group the catchments into three reactivity regions of similar
   flood behavior. These regions were not only characterized by similar
   hydrograph shapes and reactivity but also by event magnitudes and
   triggering event conditions. We envision these regions to be useful in
   regionalization studies, regional flood frequency analyses, and to allow
   for the construction of synthetic design hydrographs in ungauged
   catchments. The clustering approach based on functional data which
   establish these regions is very flexible and has the potential to be
   extended to other geographical regions or toward the use in climate
   impact studies.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{616}},
Pages = {{1392-1403}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Climate impact studies regarding floods usually focus on peak discharges
   and a bivariate assessment of peak discharges and hydrograph volumes is
   not commonly included. A joint consideration of peak discharges and
   hydrograph volumes, however, is crucial when assessing flood risks for
   current and future climate conditions. Here, we present a methodology to
   develop synthetic design hydrographs for future climate conditions that
   jointly consider peak discharges and hydrograph volumes. First, change
   factors are derived based on a regional climate model and are applied to
   observed precipitation and temperature time series. Second, the modified
   time series are fed into a calibrated hydrological model to simulate
   runoff time series for future conditions. Third, these time series are
   used to construct synthetic design hydrographs. The bivariate flood
   frequency analysis used in the construction of synthetic design
   hydrographs takes into account the dependence between peak discharges
   and hydrograph volumes, and represents the shape of the hydrograph. The
   latter is modeled using a probability density function while the
   dependence between the design variables peak discharge and hydrograph
   volume is modeled using a copula. We applied this approach to a set of
   eight mountainous catchments in Switzerland to construct
   catchment-specific and season-specific design hydrographs for a control
   and three scenario climates. Our work demonstrates that projected
   climate changes have an impact not only on peak discharges but also on
   hydrograph volumes and on hydrograph shapes both at an annual and at a
   seasonal scale. These changes are not necessarily proportional which
   implies that climate impact assessments on future floods should consider
   more flood characteristics than just flood peaks. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Having gained momentum in the last decade, the One Health initiative
   promotes a holistic approach to address complex global health issues.
   Before recommending its adoption to stakeholders, however, it is
   paramount to first compile quantitative evidence of the benefit of such
   an approach. The aim of this scoping review was to identify and
   summarize primary research that describes monetary and non-monetary
   outcomes following adoption of a One Health approach. An extensive
   literature search yielded a total of 42,167 references, of which 85 were
   included in the final analysis. The top two biotic health issues
   addressed in these studies were rabies and malaria; the top abiotic
   health issue was air pollution. Most studies described collaborations
   between human and animal (n = 42), or human and environmental
   disciplines (n = 41); commonly reported interventions included vector
   control and animal vaccination. Monetary outcomes were commonly
   expressed as cost-benefit or cost-utility ratios; non-monetary outcomes
   were described using disease frequency or disease burden measurements.
   The majority of the studies reported positive or partially positive
   outcomes. This paper illustrates the variety of health challenges that
   can be addressed using a One Health approach, and provides tangible
   quantitative measures that can be used to evaluate future
   implementations of the One Health approach.}},

Title = {{Are the radiations of temperate lineages in tropical alpine ecosystems
   pre-adapted?}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Tropical mountains around the world harbour an extraordinarily rich
   pool of plant species and are hotspots of biodiversity. Climatically,
   they can be zoned into montane climates at mid-altitudes and tropical
   alpine climates above the tree line. Around half of the tropical alpine
   species belong to plant lineages with a temperate ancestry, although
   these regions are often geographically distant. We test the hypothesis
   that these temperate lineages are pre-adapted to the tropical alpine
   climate.
   Location: New World, with a focus on tropical alpine Andes.
   Time period: Miocene to present.
   Major taxa studied: Flowering plants.
   Methods: We build multidimensional environmental models representing the
   full space of New World climates. We quantify the environmental
   similarity between the tropical alpine ecosystem and those of potential
   source areas, while correcting for regional differences by kernel
   density smoothers. Based on spatial observations of the genus Hypericum
   (St John's Wort), we quantify niche overlap and test for niche
   conservatism following intercontinental dispersal using density-weighted
   nonparametric tests. A dated species tree, biogeographical estimation,
   multi-optima Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models and model selection approaches
   are used to test for niche shifts during establishment in the tropical
   alpine Andes.
   Results: The tropical alpine ecosystem is isolated by its climate from
   adjacent regions and is climatically similar to temperate lowland biomes
   of both hemispheres. Niche conservatism is evident in the study group,
   except in the tropical alpine lineage that is characterized by niche
   expansion and shifts in temperature optima.
   Main conclusions: Our results reject the pre-adaptation hypothesis and
   instead suggest pronounced niche evolution during colonization of
   tropical alpine ecosystems. Establishment involved substantial niche
   shifts, mainly in temperature-related variables, and resulted in a
   tremendous proliferation of species in the newly invaded tropical alpine
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The changes in agricultural practice during the last century resulted in
   high-input farming in lowlands and the abandonment of crop fields in
   marginally profitable mountain regions. In Switzerland abandoned fields
   were converted into grassland. These fields had a rich historical flora
   and the few still existing fields still belong to the most species rich.
   As many arable weeds produce persistent seeds, abandoned fields should
   have a high potential to promote rare and threatened arable plants if
   tilled again. To test this hypothesis we collected 21 soil samples down
   to 20 cm depth in each the centre and the border of 38 abandoned fields.
   The centre and border samples of each field were each pooled, and
   afterwards the present seeds washed out. These seeds were then sown in
   pots and germination monitored in a greenhouse during six months. A
   total of 119 plant species were identified. Of these, 48 species were
   typical arable weeds and only one was red listed in Switzerland. The
   number of arable weeds per former field was lower at higher altitudes.
   Hence, the surveyed meadows have a small potential to promote threatened
   arable weeds if tilled again. Likely, some seeds were no longer viable
   because the fields were not tilled for a too long. If on newly
   established conservation fields no threatened species grow spontaneously
   after a few years, the reintroduction of desired plant species should be
   considered. The source of the seeds should preferably be a nearby
   species pool.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The availability of geo-referenced data increased dramatically in recent
   years, motivating the use of spatial statistics in a variety of research
   fields, including epidemiology, environmental science, remote sensing,
   and economics. Combining data measured at both point and areal support
   can improve parameter estimation and increase prediction accuracy. We
   propose a new generalized spatial fusion model framework for jointly
   analyzing point and areal data. Assuming a common latent spatial
   process, we take a Bayesian hierarchical approach to model both types of
   data without distributional constraints. The models are implemented with
   nearest neighbor Gaussian process in Stan modeling language to increase
   computational efficiency and flexibility. Our simulation study shows
   that generalized fusion models under this framework model the latent
   process better than spatial process models. We identify scenarios where
   fusion models can offer large improvements. We then apply the framework
   to epidemiological data to identify the spatial risk pattern of
   respiratory diseases and lung cancer in Canton of Zurich, Switzerland.

Abstract = {{Ocean-terminating glaciers in Arctic regions have undergone rapid
   dynamic changes in recent years, which have been related to a dramatic
   increase in calving rates. Iceberg calving is a dynamical process
   strongly influenced by the geometry at the terminus of tidewater
   glaciers. We investigate the effect of varying water level, calving
   front slope and basal sliding on the state of stress and flow regime for
   an idealized grounded ocean-terminating glacier and scale these results
   with ice thickness and velocity. Results show that water depth and
   calving front slope strongly affect the stress state while the effect
   from spatially uniform variations in basal sliding is much smaller. An
   increased relative water level or a reclining calving front slope
   strongly decrease the stresses and velocities in the vicinity of the
   terminus and hence have a stabilizing effect on the calving front. We
   find that surface stress magnitude and distribution for simple
   geometries are determined solely by the water depth relative to ice
   thickness. Based on this scaled relationship for the stress peak at the
   surface, and assuming a critical stress for damage initiation, we
   propose a simple and new parametrization for calving rates for grounded
   tidewater glaciers that is calibrated with observations.}},

   amphipods}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Habitat connectivity crucially influences dispersal of organisms. It is
   especially seen as an important driver of the spatial structuring of
   biological communities in ecosystems that have intrinsic and general
   connectivity patterns, such as the universal dendritic structure of
   fluvial networks. These networks not only define dispersal of native
   species, but also represent corridors of biological invasions, making
   understanding network topology effects on invasion dynamics and
   subsequent diversity patterns of high interest. We studied amphipod
   community diversity and structure in the upper 27,882-km(2) drainage
   basin of the river Rhine in Central Europe, focusing on differences
   between native and non-native species. Overall, species richness
   increased along the network from headwaters to the outlet nodes. We
   found, however, contrasting patterns of native and non-native amphipod
   richness along the network, with headwater nodes representing refugia
   for native species and more downstream nodes being hotspots of
   biological invasions. Importantly, while species turnover
   (beta-diversity) of native species increased with distance between nodes
   in the network, this was not the case for non-native species, indicating
   a much lower dispersal limitation of the latter. Finally, the overall
   amphipod community structure closely mirrored the topological modularity
   of the network, highlighting the network's imprint on community
   structure. Our results underpin the importance of connectivity for
   community formation and the significance of rivers for biological
   invasions and suggest that empirically observed matches of diversity
   patterns in rivers predicted by null models are the long-term outcome of
   species invasions and species sorting.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of the niche has long been a central pillar in ecological
   theory, with a traditional focus on quantifying niches at the species or
   population level. However, the importance of individual-level niche
   variation is increasingly being recognised, with a strong focus on
   individual specialisation. While examples illustrating the contribution
   of the individual niche to whole population niche structure are
   accumulating rapidly, surprisingly little is known about the conditions
   that shape the differences between these two potentially divergent
   components. Though theory predicts that stability should influence the
   extent of such intra-specific specialisation, we know of no previous
   study that has investigated its role in individual specialisation, and
   the differentiation between individual- and population niches. Here, we
   studied the diet of individuals from multiple populations of an aquatic
   top-predator, Salmo trutta, inhabiting contrasting stable, groundwater
   fed and unstable, surface water fed pre-alpine streams. Based on stomach
   content analysis, we found that individuals living in stable
   environments displayed a higher degree of specialisation than those in
   unstable environments, with the between-individual component of niche
   width being approximately twice as high in the former. We subsequently
   validated these results by evidence gained from stable isotope analysis
   of muscle tissue. As such, we reveal that environmental stability can
   significantly influence individual niches within populations, leading to
   increased specialisation.}},

Title = {{Patterns of activity and body temperature of Aldabra giant tortoises in

Abstract = {{We studied the temperature relations of wild and zoo Aldabra giant
   tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) focusing on (1) the relationship
   between environmental temperature and tortoise activity patterns (n=8
   wild individuals) and (2) on tortoise body temperature fluctuations,
   including how their core and external body temperatures vary in relation
   to different environmental temperature ranges (seasons; n=4 wild and n=5
   zoo individuals). In addition, we surveyed the literature to review the
   effect of body mass on core body temperature range in relation to
   environmental temperature in the Testudinidae. Diurnal activity of
   tortoises was bimodally distributed and influenced by environmental
   temperature and season. The mean air temperature at which activity is
   maximized was 27.9 degrees C, with a range of 25.8-31.7 degrees C.
   Furthermore, air temperature explained changes in the core body
   temperature better than did mass, and only during the coldest trial, did
   tortoises with higher mass show more stable temperatures. Our results,
   together with the overall Testudinidae overview, suggest that, once
   variation in environmental temperature has been taken into account,
   there is little effect of mass on the temperature stability of
   tortoises. Moreover, the presence of thermal inertia in an individual
   tortoise depends on the environmental temperatures, and we found no
   evidence for inertial homeothermy. Finally, patterns of core and
   external body temperatures in comparison with environmental temperatures
   suggest that Aldabra giant tortoises act as mixed conformer-regulators.
   Our study provides a baseline to manage the thermal environment of wild
   and rewilded populations of an important island ecosystem engineer
   species in an era of climate change.}},

Title = {{Linking intraspecific trait variation to community abundance dynamics
   improves ecological predictability by revealing a growth-defence
   trade-off}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific trait change, including altered behaviour or morphology,
   can drive temporal variation in interspecific interactions and
   population dynamics. In turn, variation in species' interactions and
   densities can alter the strength and direction of trait change. The
   resulting feedback between species' traits and abundance permits a wide
   range of community dynamics that would not be expected from ecological
   theories purely based on species abundances. Despite the theoretical
   importance of these interrelated processes, unambiguous experimental
   evidence of how intraspecific trait variation modifies species
   interactions and population dynamics and how this feeds back to
   influence trait variation is currently required.
   We investigate the role of trait-mediated demography in determining
   community dynamics and examine how ecological interactions influence
   trait change. We concurrently monitored the dynamics of community
   abundances and individual traits in an experimental microbial
   predator-prey-resource system. Using this data, we parameterised a
   trait-dependent community model to identify key ecologically relevant
   traits and to link trait dynamics with those of species abundances.
   Our results provide clear evidence of a feedback between trait change,
   demographic rates and species dynamics. The inclusion of trait-abundance
   feedbacks into our population model improved the predictability of
   ecological dynamics from r(2) of 34\% to 57\% and confirmed theoretical
   expectations of density-dependent population growth and species
   interactions in the system.
   Additionally, our model revealed that the feedbacks were underpinned by
   a trade-off between population growth and anti-predatory defence. High
   predator abundance was linked to a reduction in prey body size. This
   prey size decrease was associated with a reduction in its rate of
   consumption by predators and a decrease in its resource consumption.
   Modelling trait-abundance feedbacks allowed us to pinpoint the
   underlying life history trade-off which links trait and abundance
   dynamics. These results show that accounting for trait-abundance
   feedbacks has the potential to improve understanding and predictability
   of ecological dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{In several eudicot species, one copy of each member of the
   WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) gene family, WOX1 and WOX3, is
   redundantly or differentially involved in lateral leaf outgrowth,
   whereas only the WOX3 gene regulating the lateral domain of leaf
   development has been reported in grass. In this study, we show that a
   WOX3 gene, LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1 (LSY1), regulates lateral leaf
   development in a different manner ftom that of other duplicated paralogs
   of WOX3, NARROW LEAF2 (NAL2)/NAL3, in rice. A loss-of-function mutant of
   LSY1 exhibited an asymmetrical defect from early leaf development, which
   is different from a symmetric defect in a double loss-of-function mutant
   of NAL2/3, whereas the expression of both genes was observed in a
   similar domain in the margins of leaf primordia. Unlike NAL2/3,
   overexpression of LSY1 produced malformed leaves whose margins were
   curled adaxially. Expression domains and the level of adaxial/abaxial
   marker genes were affected in the LSY1-overexpressing plants, indicating
   that LSY1 is involved in regulation of adaxial-abaxial patterning at the
   margins of the leaf primordia. Additive phenotypes in some leaf traits
   of lsy1 nal2/3 triple mutants and the unchanged level of NAL2/3
   expression in the lsy1 background suggested that LSY1 regulates lateral
   leaf development independently of NAL2/3. Our results indicated that all
   of the rice WOX3 genes are involved in leaf lateral outgrowth, but the
   functions of LSY1 and NAL2/3 have diverged. We propose that the function
   of WOX3 and the regulatory mode of leaf development in rice are
   comparable with those of WOX1/WOX3 in eudicot species.}},

Title = {{No evidence of inbreeding depression in sperm performance traits in wild

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1842-1852}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Inbreeding is widely hypothesized to shape mating systems and population
   persistence, but such effects will depend on which traits show
   inbreeding depression. Population and evolutionary consequences could be
   substantial if inbreeding decreases sperm performance and hence
   decreases male fertilization success and female fertility. However, the
   magnitude of inbreeding depression in sperm performance traits has
   rarely been estimated in wild populations experiencing natural variation
   in inbreeding. Further, the hypothesis that inbreeding could increase
   within-ejaculate variation in sperm traits and thereby further affect
   male fertilization success has not been explicitly tested. We used a
   wild pedigreed song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) population, where
   frequent extrapair copulations likely create strong postcopulatory
   competition for fertilization success, to quantify effects of male
   coefficient of inbreeding (f) on key sperm performance traits. We found
   no evidence of inbreeding depression in sperm motility, longevity, or
   velocity, and the within-ejaculate variance in sperm velocity did not
   increase with male f. Contrary to inferences from highly inbred captive
   and experimental populations, our results imply that moderate inbreeding
   will not necessarily constrain sperm performance in wild populations.
   Consequently, the widely observed individual-level and population-level
   inbreeding depression in male and female fitness may not stem from
   reduced sperm performance in inbred males.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents two procedures for the wavelength calibration, in the
   oxygen telluric absorption spectral bands (O2-A, (c) = 687 nm and O2-B,
   (c) = 760.6 nm), of field fixed-point spectrometers used for reflectance
   and Sun-induced fluorescence measurements. In the first case, Ne and Ar
   pen-type spectral lamps were employed, while the second approach is
   based on a double monochromator setup. The double monochromator system
   was characterized for the estimation of errors associated with different
   operating configurations. The proposed methods were applied to three
   Piccolo Doppio-type systems built around two QE Pros and one USB2 +
   H16355 Ocean Optics spectrometers. The wavelength calibration errors for
   all the calibrations performed on the three spectrometers are reported
   and potential methodological improvements discussed. The suggested
   calibration methods were validated, as the wavelength corrections
   obtained by both techniques for the QE Pro designed for fluorescence
   investigations were similar. However, it is recommended that a neon
   emission line source, as well as an argon or mercury-argon source be
   used to have a reference wavelength closer to the O2-B feature. The
   wavelength calibration can then be optimised as close to the O2-B and
   O2-A features as possible. The monochromator approach could also be
   used, but that instrument would need to be fully characterized prior to
   use, and although it may offer a more accurate calibration, as it could
   be tuned to emit light at the same wavelengths as the absorption
   features, it would be more time consuming as it is a scanning approach.}},

Abstract = {{The Tropics are global centers of biodiversity. Ecological and land use
   gradients play a major role in the origin and maintenance of this
   diversity, yet a comprehensive synthesis of the corresponding large body
   of literature is still missing. We searched all ISI-listed journals for
   tropical gradient studies. From the resulting 1023 studies, we extracted
   study-specific information, and analyzed it using descriptive analytical
   tools and GLMs. Our results reveal that dry tropical areas are vastly
   understudied compared to their humid counterparts. The same holds true
   for large parts of Africa, but also the Philippines and the South Asian
   region. However, we also found that (applied) research output of
   developing tropical countries is nowadays on par with the output of
   developed countries. Vegetation and elevation were the most studied
   response variable and gradient, respectively. By contrast, inconspicous
   organisms such as oribatid mites and edaphic gradients were largely
   missing in the literature. Regarding biodiversity, tropical gradient
   studies dealt extensively with species richness and ecosystem diversity,
   but much less with genetic diversity. We encourage a wider use of modern
   statistical learning tools such as non-linear (spatio-temporal)
   regression and classification techniques, and simulations. Finally, we
   would embrace an even further development of synergies between applied
   and basic research and between researchers based in developed and in
   tropical countries.}},

Title = {{Range expansion as an explanation for introgression in European wildcats}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{218}},
Pages = {{49-56}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Introgression between domestic and wild taxa is a conservation issue
   because it can lead to the genetic extinction of wild taxa.
   Understanding the causes of introgression is thus a crucial task for
   conservation biologists. Here we provide evidence from biparentally,
   paternally and maternally inherited genetic markers in hybridizing
   European wildcats (Felts silvestris silvestris) and domestic cats (Fells
   silvestris catus) that one cause of introgression can be range expansion
   of the threatened species. We analyzed 68 autosomal, two Y-chromosomal
   and four mitochondrial diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms, and a
   sequence of 384 base pair of mitochondrial DNA, in 224 wild- and
   domestic cats from the Jura region of eastern Switzerland and western
   France. Using Bayesian estimation approaches, we found more gene flow
   from domestic cats to wildcats than vice versa (0.017 and 0.003 migrants
   per generation). Introgression of maternally inherited markers was
   higher than of paternally inherited markers. To test if these observed
   introgression patterns might be explained by wildcat expansion, we
   simulated neutral genetic data under various models of hybridization
   including spatial features such as range expansion. The most likely
   scenario represented an expansion of wildcats into domestic cat range.
   We also explored the geographic distribution of wildcats and hybrids. In
   comparison to wildcats, hybrids were found closer to the edge of the
   wildcat distribution range. Overall, the patterns we observed are
   compatible with the hypothesis that introgression is caused by wildcat
   range expansion, rather than by domestic cat invasion of wildcat
   habitat. That the threatened European wildcat is expanding is a positive
   sign, but careful monitoring of introgression and its fitness
   consequences is needed to ensure that the wildcat does not go
   genetically extinct in the generations to come.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) harbour high levels of
   biodiversity and large carbon stocks. Their location at high elevations
   make them especially sensitive to climate change, because a warming
   climate is enhancing upslope species migration, but human disturbance
   (especially fire) may in many cases be pushing the treeline downslope.
   TMCFs are increasingly being affected by fire, and the long-term effects
   of fire are still unknown. Here, we present a 28-year chronosequence to
   assess the effects of fire and recovery pathways of burned TMCFs, with a
   detailed analysis of carbon stocks, forest structure and diversity. We
   assessed rates of change of carbon (C) stock pools, forest structure and
   tree-size distribution pathways and tested several hypotheses regarding
   metabolic scaling theory (MST), C recovery and biodiversity. We found
   four different C stock recovery pathways depending on the selected C
   pool and time since last fire, with a recovery of total C stocks but not
   of aboveground C stocks. In terms of forest structure, there was an
   increase in the number of small stems in the burned forests up to 5-9
   years after fire because of regeneration patterns, but no differences on
   larger trees between burned and unburned plots in the long term. In
   support of MST, after fire, forest structure appears to approximate
   steady-state size distribution in less than 30 years. However, our
   results also provide new evidence that the species recovery of TMCF
   after fire is idiosyncratic and follows multiple pathways. While fire
   increased species richness, it also enhanced species dissimilarity with
   geographical distance. This is the first study to report a long-term
   chronosequence of recovery pathways to fire suggesting faster recovery
   rates than previously reported, but at the expense of biodiversity and
   aboveground C stocks.}},

Journal = {{PALEOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{44}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Intraspecific variation of organisms is of great importance to correctly
   carry out taxonomic work, which is a prerequisite for key disciplines in
   paleontology such as community paleoecology, biostratigraphy, and
   biogeography. However, intraspecific variation is rarely studied in
   ectocochleate cephalopods (ammonoids and nautiloids), for which an
   excessive number of taxa was established during the past centuries.
   Because intraspecific variation of fossilized organisms suffers from
   various biases (time averaging and taphonomy), an extant example is
   needed for actualistic comparison. We applied 3D morphometry to 93
   specimens of Nautilus pompilius from three different geographic
   populations. This data set was used to examine the intraspecific
   variation throughout ontogeny in detail. Although there are slight
   differences between the populations as well as some measurement biases,
   a common pattern of intraspecific variation appears to be present. High
   variation in morphometric variables appears early in ontogeny and then
   decreases gradually in the following ontogenetic stages. Subsequently,
   the variation shows an increase again before maturity until a sharp
   increase or decrease occurs toward the end of ontogeny. Comparison with
   intraspecific variation of ammonoids and belemnites illustrated that
   some groups have ontogenetic patterns of intraspecific variation that
   are similar to that of N. pompilius. This implies that the above
   mentioned ontogenetic pattern of intraspecific variation might be common
   in some major cephalopod clades.}},

Abstract = {{Warning signals are an effective defence strategy for aposematic prey,
   but only if they are recognized by potential predators. If predators
   must eat prey to associate novel warning signals with unpalatability,
   how can aposematic prey ever evolve? Using experiments with great tits
   (Parus major) as predators, we show that social transmission enhances
   the acquisition of avoidance by a predator population. Observing another
   predator's disgust towards tasting one novel conspicuous prey item led
   to fewer aposematic than cryptic prey being eaten for the predator
   population to learn. Despite reduced personal encounters with
   unpalatable prey, avoidance persisted and increased over subsequent
   trials. Next we use a mathematical model to show that social
   transmission can shift the evolutionary trajectory of prey populations
   from fixation of crypsis to fixation of aposematism more easily than was
   previously thought. Therefore, social information use by predators has
   the potential to have evolutionary consequences across ecological
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Timing and accumulation of snow are among the most important phenomena
   influencing land surface phenology in mountainous ecosystems. However,
   our knowledge on their influence on alpine land surface phenology is
   still limited, and much remains unclear as to which snow metrics are
   most relevant for studying this interaction. In this study, we analyzed
   five snow and phenology metrics, namely, timing (snow cover duration
   (SCD) and last snow day), accumulation of snow (mean snow water
   equivalent, SWEm), and mountain land surface phenology (start of season
   and length of season) in the Swiss Alps during the period 2003-2014. We
   examined elevational and regional variations in the relationships
   between snow and alpine land surface phenology metrics using multiple
   linear regression and relative weight analyses and subsequently
   identified the snow metrics that showed strongest associations with
   variations in alpine land surface phenology of natural vegetation types.
   We found that the relationships between snow and phenology metrics were
   pronounced in high-elevational regions and alpine natural grassland and
   sparsely vegetated areas. Start of season was influenced primarily by
   SCD, secondarily by SWEm, while length of season was equally affected by
   SCD and SWEm across different elevational bands. We conclude that SCD
   plays the most significant role compared to other snow metrics. Future
   variations of snow cover and accumulation are likely to influence alpine
   ecosystems, for instance, their species composition due to changes in
   the potential growing season. Also, their spatial distribution may
   change as a response to the new environmental conditions if these prove
   persistent.}},

Abstract = {{Powdery mildew is an important disease of cereals. It is caused by one
   species, Blumeria graminis, which is divided into formae speciales each
   of which is highly specialized to one host. Recently, a new form capable
   of growing on triticale (B.g. triticale) has emerged through
   hybridization between wheat and rye mildews (B.g. tritici and B.g.
   secalis, respectively). In this work, we used RNA sequencing to study
   the molecular basis of host adaptation in B.g. triticale. We analyzed
   gene expression in three B.g. tritici isolates, two B.g. secalis
   isolates and two B.g. triticale isolates and identified a core set of
   putative effector genes that are highly expressed in all formae
   speciales. We also found that the genes differentially expressed between
   isolates of the same form as well as between different formae speciales
   were enriched in putative effectors. Their coding genes belong to
   several families including some which contain known members of mildew
   avirulence (Avr) and suppressor (Svr) genes. Based on these findings we
   propose that effectors play an important role in host adaptation that is
   mechanistically based on Avr-Resistance gene-Svr interactions. We also
   found that gene expression in the B.g. triticale hybrid is mostly
   conserved with the parent-of-origin, but some genes inherited from B.g.
   tritici showed a B.g. secalis-like expression. Finally, we identified 11
   unambiguous cases of putative effector genes with hybrid-specific,
   non-parent of origin gene expression, and we propose that they are
   possible determinants of host specialization in triticale mildew. These
   data suggest that altered expression of multiple effector genes, in
   particular Avr and Svr related factors, might play a role in mildew host
   adaptation based on hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{Coprolites (fossil feces) provide important paleoecological information,
   such as diet of the producer, parasite infestation and gut microbiota,
   which cannot be accessed through body remains. The Upper Miocene Urumaco
   Formation, in western Venezuela, has a diverse vertebrate fauna composed
   of ground sloths, rodents, reptiles, fishes and amphibians, as well as
   coprolites. Here we describe 106 coprolites produced by a range of
   carnivorous and herbivorous vertebrates, classified into five different
   morphotypes based on their size and shape, suggesting different
   producers. Herbivorous morphotypes (Ml, M2 and M5) are the most abundant
   (59\%). The most common inclusions in these coprolites are Poaceae
   remains, although Eudicotyledoneae fragments, bacteria and cyanobacteria
   filaments were also found. The Ml morphotype has a bullet shape with
   longitudinal grooves; the M2 morphotype is rounded to oval, with at
   least one distinctive tapered end; and the M5 morphotype is a short
   cylinder with a rough surface, and rounded ends. In contrast, the
   morphotypes M3 and M4 are attributed by us to carnivores and have
   different inclusions. While M3 is a large cylinder with rounded ends and
   contains bacteria, nematode eggs and phytoliths, M4 is sausage-shaped
   and has muscle cells preserved inside. Based on the co-occurring fauna
   and the morphology of the coprolites, the probable producers were
   inferred as the following: Ml, a rodent; M2, a notoungulate; M3, a
   crocodilian; M4, an indeterminate carnivore; and M5, a sirenian. The
   preservation of herbivorous and carnivorous coprolites with bacterial,
   parasitological and muscle remains in the same formation and even the
   same outcrop is rare in the geological record. This unique association
   and preservation suggests early lithification promoted by rapid burial,
   although the presence of the boring trace Gastrochaenolites in a single
   specimen indicates some degree of time-averaging.}},

Title = {{Impacts of seven years of experimental warming and nutrient addition on
   neighbourhood species interactions and community structure in two
   contrasting alpine plant communities}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{31-40}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Global change is predicted to have major impacts on alpine and arctic
   ecosystems. Plant fitness and growth will be determined by how plants
   interact with each other at smaller scales. Local-scale neighbourhood
   interactions may be altered by environmental pertubations, which could
   fundamentally affect community structure. This study examined the
   effects of seven years of experimental warming and nutrient addition on
   overall changes in the community structure and patterns of interspecific
   interaction between neighbouring plant species in two contrasting alpine
   plant communities, mesic meadow and poor heath, in subarctic Sweden. We
   used a network approach to quantify the dissimilarity of plant
   interaction networks and the average number of interspecific
   neighbourhood interactions over time in response to different
   environmental perturbations. The results revealed that combined warming
   and nutrient addition had significant negative effects on how dissimilar
   plant interaction networks were over time compared with the control.
   Moreover, plant-plant neighbourhood interaction networks were more
   dissimilar over time in nutrient-poor heath than in nutrient-rich mesic
   meadow. In addition, nutrient addition alone and combined nutrient
   addition and warming significantly affected neighbourhood species
   interactions in both plant communities. Surprisingly, changes in
   interspecific neighbourhood interactions over time in both communities
   were very similar, suggesting that the nutrient-poor heath is as robust
   to experimental environmental perturbation as the mesic meadow.
   Comparisons of changes in neighbouring species interactions with changes
   in evenness and richness at the same scale, in order to determine
   whether diversity drove such changes in local-scale interaction
   patterns, provided moderate evidence that diversity was behind the
   changes in local-scale interspecific neighbourhood interactions. This
   implied that species might interact at smaller scales than those at
   which community measures were made. Overall, these results demonstrated
   that global change involving increased nutrient deposition and warming
   is likely to affect species interactions and alter community structure
   in plant communities, whether rich or poor in nutrients and species. (C)

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING}},

Pages = {{607-615}},
Abstract = {{Satellite image time-series (SITS) methods have contributed notably to
   detection of global change over the last decades, for instance by
   tracking vegetation changes. Compared with multi-temporal change
   detection methods, temporally highly resolved SITS methods provide more
   information in a single analysis, for instance on the type and
   consistency of change. In particular, SITS decomposition methods show a
   great potential in extracting various components from non-stationary
   time series, which allows for an improved interpretation of the temporal
   variability. Even though many case studies have applied SITS
   decomposition methods, a systematic comparison of common algorithms is
   still missing.
   In this study, the seasonal trend loess (STL), breaks for additive
   season and trend (BFAST) and multi-resolution analysis-wavelet transform
   (MRA-WT) were explored in order to evaluate their performance in
   modelling, monitoring and detecting land-cover changes with pronounced
   seasonal variations from simulated normal difference vegetation index
   time series. The selected methods have all proven their ability to
   characterize the non-stationary vegetation dynamics along with different
   physical processes driving the vegetation dynamics. Our results
   indicated that BFAST is the most accurate method for the examined
   simulated dataset in terms of RMSE, whereas MRA-WT showed a great
   potential for the extraction of multi-level vegetation dynamics.
   Considering the computational efficiency, both STL and MRA-WT
   outperformed BFAST.}},

Abstract = {{Under what conditions do critical events trigger large-scale public

   research: critical events are more likely to trigger policy change when
   intense (contentious) mobilisation from policy challengers aligns with
   the views of the general public, and is backed by major political
   allies; and critical events are more likely to trigger intense
   (contentious) mobilisation when policy challengers articulate their

   utilizers and providers of genetic resources. ABS is understood as a
   tool that should promote commutative justice between the involved
   parties. This essay discusses what exactly it is that is being exchanged
   in the ABS process. It critically analyses moral claims to compensation
   that are implied by the ABS system for genetic resources. It argues that
   with the exception of cases in which traditional knowledge is involved,
   states are not automatically entitled to compensation in return for the
   utilization of genetic resources growing within their territory.
   However, biodiversity-rich states that make an effort to protect
   biodiversity must be compensated for complying with the requests set out
   in the CBD. Although it acknowledges that the NP is a step towards
   recognizing this claim, this essay argues that ABS is not the
   appropriate method to compensate for biodiversity conservation.}},

Pages = {{856-873}},
Abstract = {{Data-driven GIScience shows a growing interest in making spatial
   information from large text data. In this paper, we quantify and thus
   evaluate the relation between text frequency and properties of the
   outer-text, geographic setting by comparing text frequencies of mountain
   names to the respective geomorphometric characteristics. We focus on
   some 2000 unique mountain names that appear some 50,000 times in a large
   compilation of texts on Swiss alpine history. The results on the full
   data set suggest only a weak relation: only 5-10\% of the variation in
   the text frequency being explained by the respective geomorphometric
   characteristics. However, an analysis of multiple scales allows us to
   identify a Simpson's Paradox. What appears to be noise' in the analysis
   of all mountains in the whole of Switzerland shows significant local
   signals. Small spatial extents, found all over Switzerland, can show
   considerably strong correlations between text frequency and spatial
   prominence, with up to 90\% of the total variation explained. We argue
   that our findings have practical implications for data-driven GIScience.
   Retrieving meaningful spatial information from text might only be
   possible if the spatial scale of analysis reflects the spatial scale
   described in the input text documents.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{2247-2271}},
Abstract = {{Fictive motion (e.g. The highway runs along the coast') is a pervasive
   phenomenon in language that can imply both a static and a moving
   observer. In a corpus of alpine narratives, it is used in three types of
   spatial descriptions: conveying the actual motion of the observer,
   describing a vista and communicating encyclopaedic spatial knowledge.
   This study takes a knowledge-based approach to develop rules for
   automated extraction and classification of these types based on an
   annotated corpus of fictive motion instances. In particular, we identify
   the differences in the set of concepts involved into the production of
   the three types of descriptions, followed by their linguistic
   operationalization. Based on that, we build a set of rules that classify
   fictive motion with an overall precision of 0.87 and recall of 0.71. The
   article highlights the importance of examining spatially rich, naturally
   occurring corpora for the lines of work dealing with the automated
   interpretation of spatial information in texts, as well as, more
   broadly, investigation of spatial language involved into various types
   of spatial discourse.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting and tracking moving targets in synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   data is a challenging task, demanding state-of-the-art processing
   methods and advanced SAR systems. Current approaches concentrate on the
   problem of either endo-clutter moving target tracking or exo-clutter
   moving target tracking, neglecting the advantages of a joint tracking
   framework. We present an approach relying on a combined exo-and
   endo-clutter processing scheme using SAR data with a high pulse
   repetition frequency. The main processing chain is subdivided into four
   major steps: 1) focusing of temporal and spatial overlapping SAR images;
   2) extracting image statistics for each of these subaperture images in
   the endo-and exo-clutter domains; 3) subsequent tracking of both
   endo-and exo-clutter observations using multitarget unscented Kalman
   filtering; and 4) calculating real-world speeds and positions from the
   SAR image space coordinates using a road network. The results of this
   approach are validated and compared with ground-based measurements, and
   it is found that 100\% of the vehicles were detected correctly with an
   accuracy in speed of 0.02 +/- 0.31 m/s and an average tracking time of
   similar to 28 s.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we assessed intracorporal mercury concentrations in
   subjects living on partially mercury-contaminated soils in a defined
   area in Switzerland. We assessed 64 mothers and 107 children who resided
   in a defined area for at least 3months. Mercury in biological samples
   (urine and hair) was measured, a detailed questionnaire was administered
   for each individual, and individual mercury soil values were obtained.
   Human biomonitoring results were compared with health-related and
   reference values. Mothers and children in our study had geometric means
   (GMs) of 0.22 mu g Hg/g creatinine in urine (95th percentile (P95)=0.85
   mu g Hg/g) and 0.16 mu g Hg/g (P95=0.56 mu g Hg/g), respectively. In
   hair, mothers and children had GMs of 0.21 mu g Hg/g (P95=0.94 mu g/g)
   and 0.18 mu g/g (P95=0.60 mu g/g), respectively. We found no evidence
   for an association between mercury values in soil and those in human
   specimens nor for a health threat in residential mothers and children.}},

Abstract = {{Arum concinnatum Schott is a highly thermogenic species, with the
   temperature of the appendix exceeding similar to 10.9 degrees C above
   the ambient temperature during thermogenesis, whereas the rates of
   respiration of the male florets in intact inflorescences peak at 0.92
   mmol s(-1) g(-1), which is the highest rate so far measured among the
   plants. Here, we attempt the ex situ exogenous induction of
   thermogenesis in whole inflorescences and in separate appendices of the
   spadix, and explore the thermogenic patterns under controlled laboratory
   conditions of light and temperature. Mature but unopened inflorescences
   and appendices showed thermogenic responses when treated with salicylic
   acid (SA), but not when treated with distilled water (control). With
   regard to light conditions, the responses revealed only one significant
   difference for inflorescences, which concerns the higher maximum
   temperature in the continuous light treatment compared with continuous
   dark. Along the ambient temperature gradient, at the lowest temperature
   edge individuals remained stable close to ambient temperature and to
   control. These findings suggest that, in general, ex situ exogenous
   induction of thermogenesis can be achieved in whole inflorescences and
   in separate appendices of spadix of A. concinnatum using SA. This study
   also indicates that SA acts independently of light conditions, while
   exogenous induction of thermogenesis takes place within an ambient
   temperature range.}},

   - can humanity rise to the challenge?}},
Journal = {{CLIMATE POLICY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{275-286}},
Abstract = {{In order to mobilize the volume of mitigation required to reach a global
   emissions path consistent with 1.5 degrees C, policy instruments need to
   be much more stringent than they have been to date. They will have to
   ensure full decarbonization of key economic sectors within one
   generation, which will require retirement of high-carbon assets before
   the end of their technical lifetime. However, political economy shows
   that only those instruments will be implemented that benefit
   well-organized interest groups while spreading costs as widely as
   possible. In the past, this has led to distortions such as emissions
   trading systems with systemic overallocation of allowances, or carbon
   taxes that exempt industry. Under favourable lobbying constellations
   strong subsidy schemes for mitigation can emerge. Renewable feed-in
   tariffs in Europe persisted for over two decades and were crucial for
   the breakthrough of wind and solar power technologies. But once
   competition from China led to the demise of European technology
   providers and the European population started to feel the pinch from the
   surcharges on their electricity bills, feed-in tariffs were abolished.
   Historically, rapid transformations of the nature required to reach 1.5
   degrees C built on either lavish public investment into the underlying
   infrastructure or a general notion of national emergency. Innovative
   forms of market mechanisms could convince policy makers that mitigation
   costs are lower than expected and thus accelerate mitigation. For the
   long-term success of far-reaching mitigation policies, it will be
   crucial whether they can be framed as harnessing an opportunity or
   whether they are seen as a grim, but grudgingly accepted response to a
   societal emergency.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical work has emphasized the important role of individual traits
   on population dynamics, but empirical models are often based on average
   or stage-dependent demographic rates. In this study on a monogamous
   bird, the Eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops), we show how the interactions
   between male and female fixed and dynamic heterogeneity influence
   demographic rates and population dynamics. We built an integral
   projection model including individual sex, age, condition (reflecting
   dynamic heterogeneity), and fixed morphology (reflecting fixed
   heterogeneity). Fixed morphology was derived from a principal component
   analysis of six morphological traits. Our results revealed that
   reproductive success and survival were linked to fixed heterogeneity,
   whereas dynamic heterogeneity influenced mainly the timing of
   reproduction. Fixed heterogeneity had major consequences for the
   population growth rate, but interestingly, its effect on population
   dynamics differed between the sexes. Female fixed morphology was
   directly linked to annual reproductive success, whereas male fixed
   morphology also influenced annual survival, being twice higher in large
   than in small males. Even in a monogamous bird with shared parental
   care, large males can reach 10\% higher fitness than females. Including
   the dynamics of male and female individual traits in population models
   refines our understanding of the individual mechanisms that influence
   demographic rates and population dynamics and can help in identifying
   differences in sex-specific strategies.}},

Title = {{The impact of early Quaternary climate change on the diversification and
   population dynamics of a South American cactus species}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{76-88}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Climatic oscillations have been suggested to promote speciation and
   changes in species distributions, mostly in connection with the Last
   Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, the LGM is just the most recent of the
   20+ glacial-interglacial periods that characterise the Quaternary. Here,
   we investigate the role of climatic changes and geomorphological
   features in shaping the evolution, distribution and population dynamics
   of the South American cactus Cereus hildmannianus.
   Location: South-eastern South America.
   Methods: We built a large fossil-calibrated phylogeny for cacti (family
   Cactaceae), comprising 128 species distributed in all subfamilies, using
   a Bayesian relaxed clock. We used the results to derive a secondary
   calibration for a population-level phylogeny in C. hildmannianus. We
   amplified two plastid (trnQ-5'rps16 and psbJ-petA) and one nuclear
   marker (PhyC) for 24 populations. We estimated population dynamics,
   ancestral areas, and species distribution models to infer the clade's
   evolutionary history in time and space.
   Results: Our results show a major population divergence of C.
   hildmannianus at c. 2.60 Ma, which is strikingly coincident with the
   transition of the Pliocene-Pleistocene and onset of Quaternary
   glaciations. This was followed by a complex phylogeographic scenario
   involving population expansions across ecologically diverse regions.
   Main conclusions: Contrary to the dominant research focus on the LGM,
   our study indicates a major impact of the first Quaternary glaciation on
   the distribution and population divergence of a South American plant
   species. Further intraspecific events seem related to successive
   climatic changes and geomorphology, including the development of the
   coastal plain and its peculiar diversity. We propose that the first
   Quaternary glaciation acted as a major evolutionary bottleneck, whereby
   many warm-adapted lineages succumbed, while those that survived could
   diversify and better cope with subsequent climatic oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{Hericium erinaceus is an edible and medicinal mushroom with potential
   neuroprotective effects. The study of H. erinaceus has attracted
   considerable attention during the past 10 years, particularly with
   regard to its potential utility in the treatment of motor dysfunction,
   Alzheimer disease, and other forms of dementia. We previously determined
   that oral supplementation with H. erinaceus results in significant
   improvements in novelty-seeking behavior and novel object recognition in
   mice. In this study, H. erinaceus was added to the diets of wild-type
   mice for 2 months, and effects on spatial memory were evaluated by means
   of a Y maze and an object location task. We found that H. erinaceus
   increased general locomotor activity but had no effect on spatial
   memory. Thus, oral supplementation with H. erinaceus yields specific and
   selective improvements in recognition memory without altering spatial
   working memory, which supports the hypothesis that recognition memory
   can be modeled as a dual process. In this model, the perirhinal cortex
   supports the recognition of individual items as part of a circuit
   involved in familiarity with an encountered stimulus, whereas the
   hippocampus supports recollected associations and relationships between
   stimuli.}},
